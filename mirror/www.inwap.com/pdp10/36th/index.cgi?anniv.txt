.                     36TH(*) ANNIVERSARY BANQUET
                           IN CELEBRATION OF
                     DIGITAL'S 36-BIT ARCHITECTURE

                         (* SLIGHTLY BELATED)

On the occasion of the DECWORLD 2001 event being sponsored by the
Computer Museum History Center on Saturday, June 16, 2001,
(http://www.computerhistory.org/decworld) a Chinese banquet will
be held to celebrate the 36th Anniversary of Digital's 36-bit
architecture.  The actual anniversary took place last year with
little notice, but we intend to correct this oversight!

All former DEC employees, customers, friends and aficionados of

     -- the PDP-6, DECSystem-10, and DECSYSTEM-20 computers,
     -- the TOPS-10, TOPS-20, TENEX, SAIL, and ITS operating systems
     -- all the cousins and other decendants from Foonly, Systems
        Concepts and XKL

are cordially invited to attend.  Note that this event is independent
of DECWORLD 2001, so you are welcome to participate even if you are
not attending the Saturday event.

We will gather at 7:30PM, Friday, June 15, 2001 at:

         Mandarin Classic Restaurant
         397 Main Street (corner of 1st St.)
         Los Altos, CA

         (See directions below.)

The price will be $21, not including beverages.

Please come prepared to reunite with old friends, as well as share
memorabilia, humor, war stories and other legends from the 36-bit era.

We will need a firm head count by June 13, so kindly RSVP via e-mail
to Clive Dawson: clive.dawson "at" amd.com.  NOTE THAT IF YOU SIGN UP,
YOU ARE MAKING A COMMITMENT TO PAY FOR DINNER, since we will be
responsible for payment based on the count we submit.

Please pass this announcment along to anybody you think might be interested.

Hope to see you there!

Clive Dawson and Les Earnest
