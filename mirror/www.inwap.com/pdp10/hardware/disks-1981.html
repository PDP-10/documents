The KS-2020 used <A HREF=#RM03">RM03</A> or <A HREF="#RP06">RP06</A> disk
drives.  Up to 8 disks, in any combination, on a single MASSBUS.

<p>The KL-10 used <A HREF="#RP06">RP06</A> or <A HREF="#RP20">RP20</A> disk
drives.  Up to 8 disks per MASSBUS.  (Each RP20 spindle counts as 2 disks.)

<H1>Disks</H1>
(From the 1981 edition of the "<b>DECsystem-10 Technical Summary</b>".)

<p>The disk subsystems provide high performance and reliability.  Disk
features include accurate server positioning, error correction, and offset
positioning recovery.  Table 7-1 summarizes the capactities and speeds of the
disk devices.

<p>To support the performance and reliability features of the system's disk
devices, the operating system's disk device drivers provide comprehensive
error recovery algorithms (for example, ECC and offset recovery for disk) and
log all device errors.

<p>Disk controllers allow several drives to preforma simultaneous seek
operations.  Since the controller is not busy during seek operations, data
transfers on one drive can overlap seeks in progress on other drives.  If more
than one drive is on the same controller, overlapped seeks will accelerate
processing for the disks on that controller.  Overlapped seeks increase
throughput by decreasing the effective access time.

The RM03 is a top-loading, free-standing disk drive housed in a dedicated
cabinet.  Subsystems are expandable to eight disk drives or 536 Mb.
The RM03 has a formatted capacity of 67 megabytes and an average access time
of 38 milliseconds.  Its maximum transfer rate is 250,000 36-bit words per
second.  The RM03 does 18-bit NPR data transfers over a UNIBUS and 36-bit NPR
data transfers over the KS10 backplane bus.

<A HREF="../images/rp06.jpg">
<IMG SRC="../images/rp06.gif" WIDTH=61 HEIGHT=62 ALT="RP06" ALIGN=right></A>

The RP06 is a large capacity disk drive.  [176,000,000 bytes; the equivalent
of the IBM 3330-II disk drive.]  This disk offers both high performance and a
low price per megabyte of storage.  It uses a removable disk pack and has a
wide variety of large disk features.

<p>RM03 and RP06 disk drives can be mised on the same RH11 controller on a
KS10; however they can not be mised within the same logical file structure.

<A HREF="../images/rp20.jpg">
<IMG SRC="../images/rp20.gif" WIDTH=80 HEIGHT=39 ALT="RP20" ALIGN=right></A>

The RTP20 is the highest capacity disk offered by DIGITAL.  The RTP20 consists
of an RP20 disk drive and controller.  THe RP20 is a dual-spindle device with
a formatted capacity of 967 megabytes.  Master Subystems are packages to
include an RH20/DX20 Channel, RTP20 Controller, and RP20 Master Disk.  When
additional capacity is required, the subsystem can be expanded to include up
to three add-on drives (1200 megabytes unformatted).

<p>Each RP20 data module has fifteen recording surfaces with two read/write
heads per surface and a transfer rate of 1.2 megabytes per second with a 25 ms
averate access time.  Each data module may transfer independently with the
dual-port feature.
