If you are a home collector of Digital's 36b systems, you can now get a free,
personal use, non-commercial license for your existing system software
(TOPS-10, TOPS-20, and related layered products and utilities).  Simply fill
in the attached license form and return it to Dick Greeley in Digital's
Corporate Licensing Office (rgreeley@powdml.enet.dec.com).  This license
grants you a free, as is, non-commercial license for using 36b software on a
home system.

You must already have, or have access to, the software itself; the license
does NOT include any distribution medium, documentation, or support.
