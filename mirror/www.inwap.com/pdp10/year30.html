Subject: Report on 30th Anniversary of 36 Bits Celebration
<p>
Hi folks,
<p>
Here's a report on the 30th Anniversary celebration for 36 Bits, which
was held May 10, 1995, at the Washington, DC DECUS Symposium.  We
began with the 36-Bit Magic session, chaired by me and Rich Alderson.
We had a pretty good turn out (all things considered...!) of about 40
people.  All constituencies were represented, including customers,
Digital developers and marketing folks.  Even DEC execs were
represented by none other than Rosanne Giordano, who many of you will
recall was at the helm of the LCG sailboat when the infamous
announcement was made in St. Louis in 1983.  (We considered having a
couple of armed guards escort Rosanne into the room, just to make her
feel at home! ;-)
<p>
A show of hands revealed that we had folks who had used every type of
36-bit system ever produced, going back to the PDP-6.  Winner of the
oldest old-timer award was probably Bruce Corbin, who worked for
Digital in the early 60's and was one of the original engineers on the
PDP-6 team.<p>
<p>
Our guest speaker was Len Bosack, who worked with 36-bit systems at
Digital from 1973-79, and then at the Stanford Computer Science Lab
from 1979-84.  He was the founder of Cisco in 1984, which he left in
1991 to found XKL Corp., producer of the latest generation of 36-bit
systems, namely the TD-1.  Len gave a fascinating talk which provided
some interesting insight about the road he has traveled and his
decision to form XKL.
<p>
The floor was then opened to anybody who had war stories to tell, both
new and old.  We observed the passing of Jim Flemming, Tony Wachs, and
Peter Conklin by showing excerpts from the 36-Bit Pioneer's Roundtable 
session, held at our 20th Anniversary Celebration in 1984, which Jim and
Tony had participated in.
<p>
The balance of the session was devoted to the awarding of a couple of
dozen door prizes, including some 25th Anniversary VAX-Buster T-shirts,
several original LCG mugs, and a couple of 20th Anniversary editions of
the Large Systems Newsletter.  All attendees were also provided with a
special edition of the famous sailboat patch, produced especially for
the 30th Anniversary.
<p>
Following the session, several of us adjourned for dinner in nearby
Chinatown.  A sudden downpour upon exiting the restaurant caused us
all to dash away for cover, vowing that we would meet again for the
36th(!) Anniversary in the year 2000.
<p>
I am sorry to report that for some unexplained reason, DECUS did not
record the 36-Bit Anniversary session, and therefore there is no audio
tape available.  I also regret that we didn't pass around a sign-up
sheet to record who was there for posterity.  Perhaps those of you who
attended could send me lists of those you remember, and I will
consolidate them.
<p>
I do, however, have a supply of the special sailboat patches available.
The patches are rectangular, about 1.5" x 2.5".  The sailboat is
colored blue and orange (naturally!), on a light blue background with
dark blue lettering which says "30 YEARS   36 BITS".  If you would like
one, send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to:
<pre>

		1409 Quaker Ridge Dr.

(A donation of, say, $2 per patch would be much appreciated, but is not
required unless you want more than one.)
<p>
Regards to all,
<p>
