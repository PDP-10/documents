36 bit hackers:

Fornax is moving to smaller quarters (our KL maintenance business
is winding down and we no longer need room to store 15 spare KLs
and 35 RP06 disk drives....).

We are the proud owners of a museum quality Model A KL (KL1269) and
a custom designed 1MW static RAM memory box (designed and built by
Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island).  KL1269 was built
12-29-77, and I believe was either the second or third delivered
outside of DEC.

We swapped in a 2060 KL to replace this machine 3.5 years ago when
we won the KL service contract at Brookhaven.

This machine is offered free to any individual/organization willing
to come to New Jersey this week to take it away.  If there are no
takers, then we will unfortunately have to send it to the scrapper.
