The original JARGON.TXT file was maintained in three locations back in
the days of the ARPANET.  It was AIWORD.RF[UP,DOC] at SAIL (Stanford A.I.
Lab) and GLS;JARGON at MIT-MC and MIT-AI.  A snapshot of that file
taken 14-Nov-1982 was online at <A HREF="ftp://mc.lcs.mit.edu/its/ai/humor/jargon.68.Z">
ftp://mc.lcs.mit.edu/its/ai/humor/jargon.68.Z</A> (it is 43K, uncompresses
to 87K).  [Archive offline, Jan 2001.]
<p>
I'm not sure exactly which version of JARGON was used when Guy L. Steele
published "The Hacker's Dictionary".
<p>
After Eric Raymond published "The New Hacker's Dictionary", the JARGON file
grew to 1.1 megabytes but the file hasn't been the same; it has lost a
lot of its hacker nature.

Oh Lord won't you buy me a PDP-10
My friends all hack Vaxen; I must make amends
Hacked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
So Lord, won't you buy me a PDP-10

Oh Lord won't you buy me an RM-03
Faster disk access is trying to find me
I wait for Disk Ready each afternoon 'till 3
So Lord, won't you buy me an RM-03

Oh Lord won't you buy me a disk pack so round
I'm counting on you, Lord, please don't let me down
God, I need a scratch pack; there's none to be found
So Lord won't you buy me a disk pack so round.

<H2><A NAME="ADVENT">ADVENT</A></H2>
   /ad'vent/ n. The prototypical computer adventure game, first
   implemented on the {PDP-10} by Will Crowther as an attempt at
   computer-refereed fantasy gaming, and expanded into a
   puzzle-oriented game by Don Woods.  Now better known as Adventure,
   but the {{TOPS-10}} operating system permitted only 6-letter
   filenames.  See also {vadding}.
<p> 
   This game defined the terse, dryly humorous style now expected in
   text adventure games, and popularized several tag lines that have
   become fixtures of hacker-speak:  "A huge green fierce snake bars
   the way!"  "I see no X here" (for some noun X).  "You are in a
   maze of twisty little passages, all alike."  "You are in a little
   maze of twisty passages, all different."  The `magic words'
   {xyzzy} and {plugh} also derive from this game.
<p> 
   Crowther, by the way, participated in the exploration of the
   Mammoth & Flint Ridge cave system; it actually *has* a
   `Colossal Cave' and a `Bedquilt' as in the game, and the `Y2' that
   also turns up is cavers' jargon for a map reference to a secondary
   entrance.
<p>
   From <a href="mailto:bbourn@nai.net">Bill Bourn</A> (30-Oct-95):<br>
       I never got to play Adventure myself because I translated that
       36-bit fortran to PL/1 for VM/CMS.  It wasn't an easy fit on the
       32-bit IBM mainframe.  I did get a kick out of watching my "testing"
       cadre stumble around the Colossal Cave though.


<H2><A NAME="AOS">AOS</A></H2>
   1. /aws/ (East Coast), /ay-os/ (West Coast) [based on a
   PDP-10 increment instruction] vt.,obs. To increase the amount of
   something.  "AOS the campfire."  Usage: considered silly, and now
   obsolete.  Now largely supplanted by {bump}.  See {SOS}.
<p>
   Historical note: AOS in sense 1 was the name of a {PDP-10}
   instruction that took any memory location in the computer and added
   1 to it; AOS meant `Add One and do not Skip'.  Why, you may ask,
   does the `S' stand for `do not Skip' rather than for `Skip'?  Ah,
   here was a beloved piece of PDP-10 folklore.  There were eight such
   instructions: AOSE added 1 and then skipped the next instruction
   if the result was Equal to zero; AOSG added 1 and then skipped if
   the result was Greater than 0; AOSN added 1 and then skipped
   if the result was Not 0; AOSA added 1 and then skipped Always;
   and so on.  Just plain AOS didn't say when to skip, so it never
   skipped.
<P>
   For similar reasons, AOJ meant `Add One and do not Jump'.  Even
   more bizarre, SKIP meant `do not SKIP'!  If you wanted to skip the
   next instruction, you had to say `SKIPA'.  Likewise, JUMP meant
   `do not JUMP'; the unconditional form was JUMPA.  However, hackers
   never did this.  By some quirk of the 10's design, the {JRST}
   (Jump and ReSTore flag with no flag specified) was actually faster
   and so was invariably used.  Such were the perverse mysteries of
   assembler programming.

<H2><A NAME="BLT">BLT</A></H2>
   /B-L-T/, /bl*t/ or (rarely) /belt/ n.,vt. Synonym for
   {blit}.  This is the original form of {blit} and the ancestor
   of {bitblt}.  It referred to any large bit-field copy or move
   operation (one resource-intensive memory-shuffling operation done
   on pre-paged versions of ITS, WAITS, and TOPS-10 was sardonically
   referred to as `The Big BLT').  The jargon usage has outlasted the
   {PDP-10} BLock Transfer instruction from which {BLT} derives;
   nowadays, the assembler mnemonic {BLT} almost always means
   `Branch if Less Than zero'.

<H2><A NAME="connector">connector conspiracy</A></H2>
   [probably came into prominence with the
   appearance of the KL-10 (one model of the {PDP-10}), none of
   whose connectors matched anything else] n. The tendency of
   manufacturers (or, by extension, programmers or purveyors of
   anything) to come up with new products that don't fit together
   with the old stuff, thereby making you buy either all new stuff or
   expensive interface devices.  The KL-10 Massbus connector was
   actually *patented* by DEC, which reputedly refused to license
   the design and thus effectively locked third parties out of
   competition for the lucrative Massbus peripherals market.  This is
   a source of never-ending frustration for the diehards who maintain
   older PDP-10 or VAX systems.  Their CPUs work fine, but they are
   stuck with dying, obsolescent disk and tape drives with low
   capacity and high power requirements.
 
<H2><A NAME="DDT">DDT</A></H2>
   /D-D-T/ n. 1. Generic term for a program that assists in
   debugging other programs by showing individual machine instructions
   in a readable symbolic form and letting the user change them.  In
   this sense the term DDT is now archaic, having been widely
   displaced by `debugger' or names of individual programs like
   `dbx', `adb', `gdb', or `sdb'.  
<p>
   2. [ITS] Under MIT's fabled {{ITS}} operating system, DDT (running under
   the alias HACTRN) was also used as the {shell} or top level command
   language used to execute other programs.  3. Any one of several
   specific DDTs (sense 1) supported on early DEC hardware.  The DEC
   PDP-10 Reference Handbook (1969) contained a footnote on the first
   page of the documentation for DDT which illuminates the origin of
   the term:
<blockquote>
     Historical footnote: DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1
     computer in 1961.  At that time DDT stood for "DEC Debugging Tape".
     Since then, the idea of an on-line debugging program has propagated
     throughout the computer industry.  DDT programs are now available
     for all DEC computers.  Since media other than tape are now
     frequently used, the more descriptive name "Dynamic Debugging
     Technique" has been adopted, retaining the DDT abbreviation.
     Confusion between DDT-10 and another well known pesticide,
     dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (C14-H9-Cl5) should be minimal
     since each attacks a different, and apparently mutually exclusive,
     class of bugs.
</blockquote>
   Sadly, this quotation was removed from later editions of the
   handbook after the {suit}s took over and DEC became much more
   `businesslike'.
<p>
   The history above is known to many old-time hackers.  But there's
   more: Peter Samson, author of the {TMRC} lexicon, reports that
   he named `DDT' after a similar tool on the TX-0 computer, the
   direct ancestor of the PDP-1 built at MIT's Lincoln Lab in 1957.
   The debugger on that ground-breaking machine (the first
   transistorized computer) rejoiced in the name FLIT (FLexowriter
   Interrogation Tape).

<H2><A NAME="DPB">DPB</A></H2>
   /d*-pib'/ [from the PDP-10 instruction set] vt. To plop
   something down in the middle.  Usage: silly.  "DPB
   yourself into that couch there."  The connotation would be that
   the couch is full except for one slot just big enough for you to
   sit in.  DPB means `DePosit Byte', and was the name of a PDP-10
   instruction that inserts some bits into the middle of some other
   bits.  This usage has been kept alive by the Common LISP function
   of the same name.

<H2><A NAME="elder">elder days</A></H2>
   n. The heroic age of hackerdom (roughly, pre-1980); the
   era of the {PDP-10}, {TECO}, {{ITS}}, and the ARPANET.  This
   term has been rather consciously adopted from J. R. R. Tolkien's
   fantasy epic `The Lord of the Rings'.  Compare {Iron Age};
   see also {elvish}.
 
<H2><A NAME="EXCH">EXCH</A></H2>
   /eks'ch*/ or /eksch/ vt. To exchange two things, each for the
   other; to swap places.  If you point to two people sitting down and
   say "Exch!", you are asking them to trade places.  EXCH,
   meaning EXCHange, was originally the name of a PDP-10 instruction
   that exchanged the contents of a register and a memory location.
   Many newer hackers tend to be thinking instead of the {PostScript}
   exchange operator (which is usually written in lowercase).

<H2><A NAME="FOONLY">Foonly</A></H2>
   n. 1. The {PDP-10} successor that was to have been built by
   the Super Foonly project at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence
   Laboratory along with a new operating system.  The intention was to
   leapfrog from the old DEC timesharing system SAIL was running to a
   new generation, bypassing TENEX which at that time was the ARPANET
   standard.  ARPA funding for both the Super Foonly and the new
   operating system was cut in 1974.  Most of the design team went to
   DEC and contributed greatly to the design of the PDP-10 model KL10.
<p>
   2. The name of the company formed by Dave Poole, one of the
   principal Super Foonly designers, and one of hackerdom's more
   colorful personalities.  Many people remember the parrot which sat
   on Poole's shoulder and was a regular companion.
<p>
   3. Any of the machines built by Poole's company.  The first was the F-1
   (a.k.a.  Super Foonly), which was the computational engine used to create
   the graphics in the movie "TRON".  The F-1 was the fastest PDP-10 ever
   built, but only one was ever made.  The effort drained Foonly of its
   financial resources, and they turned towards building smaller, slower,
   and much less expensive machines.  Unfortunately, these ran not the
   popular {TOPS-20} but a TENEX varient called Foonex; this seriously
   limited their market.  Also, the machines shipped were actually
   wire-wrapped engineering prototypes requiring individual attention from
   more than usually competent site personnel, and thus had significant
   reliability problems.  Poole's legendary temper and unwillingness to
   suffer fools gladly did not help matters.  By the time of the Jupiter
   project cancellation in 1983 Foonly's proposal to build another F-1 was
   eclipsed by the {Mars}, and the company never quite recovered.  See the
   {Mars} entry for the continuation and moral of this story.

<H2>Origin of the name Foonly</H2>

Comment from Joe Smith:  In late 1987 I had a chance to see the D. C.
Power Lab (the AI lab was named after Mr. D. C. Power; and not after
an electrical term).  One of the guys there was showing off the
space cadet keyboards connected to the KA+KL combo.  He mentioned that
DEC had took their design, and the designers, and created the KL-10 as
a scaled-back version of the Foonly.  When asked where "Foonly" came
from, the tour guide stated that when someone typed "foo" at the program,
it came back with "foonly".  This recollection matches this message
from Edward Rice:

  From: ehrice@his.com (Edward Rice)
  Newsgroups: alt.folklore.computers,alt.sys.pdp10
  Subject: Re: PDP10 clones (was: Compuserve and the DEC-10)
  Date: Fri, 06 Oct 1995 14:04:08 -0500
  When I asked about this here recently, I received e-mail from
  rwa@cs.athabascau.ca (Ross Alexander) with the following explanation:

     It comes from the error diagnostic spat out by someone's pdp10
     assembler; if you said "foo" to it, it would say "foo: nli"
     (not legal instruction).  This became a sort of mantra.

  As part of a small group that makes jokes about "inpitUL" (pronounced
  "in-pi-TUHL" and which stands for "is not presently in the User List"), I
  find this entirely plausible.

<H2><A NAME="HAKMEM">HAKMEM</A></H2>
   /hak'mem/ n. MIT AI Memo 239 (February 1972).  A
   legendary collection of neat mathematical and programming hacks
   contributed by many people at MIT and elsewhere.  (The title of the
   memo really is "HAKMEM", which is a 6-letterism for `hacks
   memo'.)  Some of them are very useful techniques, powerful
   theorems, or interesting unsolved problems, but most fall into the
   category of mathematical and computer trivia.  Here is a sampling
   of the entries (with authors), slightly paraphrased:
<p>
   Item 41 (Gene Salamin): There are exactly 23,000 prime numbers less
   than 2^18.
<p>
   Item 46 (Rich Schroeppel): The most *probable* suit
   distribution in bridge hands is 4-4-3-2, as compared to 4-3-3-3,
   which is the most *evenly* distributed.  This is because the
   world likes to have unequal numbers: a thermodynamic effect saying
   things will not be in the state of lowest energy, but in the state
   of lowest disordered energy.
<P>
   Item 81 (Rich Schroeppel): Count the magic squares of order 5
   (that is, all the 5-by-5 arrangements of the numbers from 1 to 25
   such that all rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same
   number).  There are about 320 million, not counting those that
   differ only by rotation and reflection.
<P>
   Item 154 (Bill Gosper): The myth that any given programming
   language is machine independent is easily exploded by computing the
   sum of powers of 2.  If the result loops with period = 1
   with sign +, you are on a sign-magnitude machine.  If the
   result loops with period = 1 at -1, you are on a
   twos-complement machine.  If the result loops with period greater
   than 1, including the beginning, you are on a ones-complement
   machine.  If the result loops with period greater than 1, not
   including the beginning, your machine isn't binary --- the pattern
   should tell you the base.  If you run out of memory, you are on a
   string or bignum system.  If arithmetic overflow is a fatal error,
   some fascist pig with a read-only mind is trying to enforce machine
   independence.  But the very ability to trap overflow is machine
   dependent.  By this strategy, consider the universe, or, more
   precisely, algebra: Let X = the sum of many powers of 2 =
   ...111111.  Now add X to itself:
   X + X = ...111110 Thus, 2X = X - 1, so
   X = -1.  Therefore algebra is run on a machine (the
   universe) that is two's-complement.
<P>
   Item 174 (Bill Gosper and Stuart Nelson): 21963283741 is the only
   number such that if you represent it on the {PDP-10} as both an
   integer and a floating-point number, the bit patterns of the two
   representations are identical.
<P>
   Item 176 (Gosper): The "banana phenomenon" was encountered when
   processing a character string by taking the last 3 letters typed
   out, searching for a random occurrence of that sequence in the
   text, taking the letter following that occurrence, typing it out,
   and iterating.  This ensures that every 4-letter string output
   occurs in the original.  The program typed BANANANANANANANA....  We
   note an ambiguity in the phrase, "the Nth occurrence of."  In one
   sense, there are five 00's in 0000000000; in another, there are
   nine.  The editing program TECO finds five.  Thus it finds only the
   first ANA in BANANA, and is thus obligated to type N next.  By
   Murphy's Law, there is but one NAN, thus forcing A, and thus a
   loop.  An option to find overlapped instances would be useful,
   although it would require backing up N - 1 characters before
   seeking the next N-character string.
<P>
   Note: This last item refers to a {Dissociated Press}
   implementation.  See also {banana problem}.
<P>
   HAKMEM also contains some rather more complicated mathematical and
   technical items, but these examples show some of its fun flavor.

<H2><A NAME="highmoby">high moby</A></H2>
   /hi:' mohb'ee/ n. The high half of a 512K {PDP-10}'s
   physical address space; the other half was of course the low moby.  This
   usage has been generalized in a way that has outlasted the
   {PDP-10}; for example, at the 1990 Washington D.C. Area Science
   Fiction Conclave (Disclave), when a miscommunication resulted in two
   separate wakes being held in commemoration of the shutdown of MIT's
   last {{ITS}} machines, the one on the upper floor was dubbed the
   `high moby' and the other the `low moby'.  All parties involved
   {grok}ked this instantly.  See {moby}.
 
<H2><A NAME="ITS">ITS</A></H2>
   /I-T-S/ n. 1. Incompatible Time-sharing System, an
   influential but highly idiosyncratic operating system written for
   PDP-6s and PDP-10s at MIT and long used at the MIT AI Lab.  Much
   AI-hacker jargon derives from ITS folklore, and to have been `an
   ITS hacker' qualifies one instantly as an old-timer of the most
   venerable sort.  ITS pioneered many important innovations,
   including transparent file sharing between machines and
   terminal-independent I/O.  After about 1982, most actual work was
   shifted to newer machines, with the remaining ITS boxes run
   essentially as a hobby and service to the hacker community.  The
   shutdown of the lab's last ITS machine in May 1990 marked the end
   of an era and sent old-time hackers into mourning nationwide (see
   {high moby}).  The Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden is
   maintaining one `live' ITS site at its computer museum (right next
   to the only TOPS-10 system still on the Internet), so ITS is still
   alleged to hold the record for OS in longest continuous use
   (however, {{WAITS}} is a credible rival for this palm).
<p>
   2. A mythical image of operating-system perfection
   worshiped by a bizarre, fervent retro-cult of old-time hackers and
   ex-users (see {troglodyte}, sense 2).  ITS worshipers manage
   somehow to continue believing that an OS maintained by
   assembly-language hand-hacking that supported only monocase
   6-character filenames in one directory per account remains superior
   to today's state of commercial art (their venom against UNIX is
   particularly intense).  See also {holy wars},
   {Weenix}.

<H2><A NAME="JFCL">JFCL</A></H2>
   /jif'kl/, /jaf'kl/, /j*-fi'kl/ vt., obs. (alt.
   `jfcl') To cancel or annul something.  "Why don't you jfcl that
   out?"  The fastest do-nothing instruction on older models of the
   PDP-10 happened to be JFCL, which stands for "Jump if Flag set and
   then CLear the flag"; this does something useful, but is a very
   fast no-operation if no flag is specified.  Geoff Goodfellow, one
   of the jargon-1 co-authors, has long had JFCL on the license plate
   of his BMW.  Usage: rare except among old-time PDP-10 hackers.
 
<H2><A NAME="JRST">JRST</A></H2>
   /jerst/ [based on the PDP-10 jump instruction] v.,obs. To
   suddenly change subjects, with no intention of returning to the
   previous topic.  Usage: rather rare except among PDP-10 diehards, and
   considered silly.  See also {AOS}.
 
<H2><A NAME="LDB">LDB</A></H2>
   /l*'d*b/ [from the PDP-10 instruction set] vt. To extract
   from the middle.  "LDB me a slice of cake, please." This usage
   has been kept alive by Common LISP's function of the same name.
   Considered silly.  See also {DPB}.
 
<H2><A NAME="Mars">Mars</A></H2>
   n. A legendary tragic failure, the archetypal Hacker Dream
   Gone Wrong.  Mars was the code name for a family of PDP-10
   compatible computers built by Systems Concepts (now, The SC Group);
   the multi-processor SC-30M, the small uniprocessor SC-25M, and the
   never-built superprocessor SC-40M.  These machines were marvels of
   engineering design; although not much slower than the unique
   {Foonly} F-1, they were physically smaller and consumed less
   power than the much slower DEC KS10 or Foonly F-2, F-3, or F-4
   machines.  They were also completely compatible with the DEC KL10,
   and ran all KL10 binaries, including the operating system, with no
   modifications at about 2--3 times faster than a KL10.
<p>   
   When DEC cancelled the Jupiter project in 1983, Systems Concepts
   should have made a bundle selling their machine into shops with a
   lot of software investment in PDP-10s, and in fact their spring
   1984 announcement generated a great deal of excitement in the
   PDP-10 world.  TOPS-10 was running on the Mars by the summer of
   1984, and TOPS-20 by early fall.  Unfortunately, the hackers
   running Systems Concepts were much better at designing machines
   than in mass producing or selling them; the company allowed itself
   to be sidetracked by a bout of perfectionism into continually
   improving the design, and lost credibility as delivery dates
   continued to slip.  They also overpriced the product ridiculously;
   they believed they were competing with the KL10 and VAX 8600 and
   failed to reckon with the likes of Sun Microsystems and other
   hungry startups building workstations with power comparable to the
   KL10 at a fraction of the price.  By the time SC shipped the first
   SC-30M to Stanford in late 1985, most customers had already made
   the traumatic decision to abandon the PDP-10, usually for VMS or
   UNIX boxes.  Most of the Mars computers built ended up being
   purchased by CompuServe.
<p>   
   This tale and the related saga of Foonly hold a lesson for hackers:
   if you want to play in the Real World, you need to learn Real World
   moves.
   
<H2><A NAME="moby">moby</A></H2>
   /moh'bee/ [MIT: seems to have been in use among model
   railroad fans years ago.  Derived from Melville's `Moby Dick' (some
   say from `Moby Pickle').] 1. adj. Large, immense, complex,
   impressive.  "A Saturn V rocket is a truly moby frob."  "Some
   MIT undergrads pulled off a moby hack at the Harvard-Yale game."
   (See appendix A). <br> 2. n. obs. The maximum address space of a
   machine (see below).  For a 680[234]0 or VAX or most modern 32-bit
   architectures, it is 4,294,967,296 8-bit bytes (4 gigabytes).  <br>3. A
   title of address (never of third-person reference), usually used to
   show admiration, respect, and/or friendliness to a competent
   hacker.  "Greetings, moby Dave.  How's that address-book thing for
   the Mac going?" <br> 4. adj. In backgammon, doubles on the dice, as in
   `moby sixes', `moby ones', etc.  Compare this with
   {bignum} (sense 2): double sixes are both bignums and moby
   sixes, but moby ones are not bignums (the use of `moby' to
   describe double ones is sarcastic).  Standard emphatic forms:
   `Moby foo', `moby win', `moby loss'.  `Foby moo': a
   spoonerism due to Richard Greenblatt.
<p> 
   This term entered hackerdom with the Fabritek 256K memory added to
   the MIT AI PDP-6 machine, which was considered unimaginably huge
   when it was installed in the 1960s (at a time when a more typical
   memory size for a timesharing system was 72 kilobytes).  Thus, a
   moby is classically 256K 36-bit words, the size of a PDP-6 or
   PDP-10 moby.  Back when address registers were narrow the term was
   more generally useful, because when a computer had virtual memory
   mapping, it might actually have more physical memory attached to it
   than any one program could access directly.  One could then say
   "This computer has 6 mobies" meaning that the ratio of physical
   memory to address space is 6, without having to say specifically
   how much memory there actually is.  That in turn implied that the
   computer could timeshare six `full-sized' programs without having to
   swap programs between memory and disk.
<p> 
   Nowadays the low cost of processor logic means that address spaces
   are usually larger than the most physical memory you can cram onto
   a machine, so most systems have much *less* than one theoretical
   `native' moby of core.  Also, more modern memory-management
   techniques (esp. paging) make the `moby count' less significant.
   However, there is one series of popular chips for which the term
   could stand to be revived --- the Intel 8088 and 80286 with their
   incredibly {brain-damaged} segmented-memory designs.  On these, a
   `moby' would be the 1-megabyte address span of a segment/offset
   pair (by coincidence, a PDP-10 moby was exactly 1 megabyte of 9-bit
   bytes).
 
<H2><A NAME="PDP-10">PDP-10</A></H2>
   [Programmed Data Processor model 10] n. The machine that
   made timesharing real.  It looms large in hacker folklore because
   of its adoption in the mid-1970s by many university computing
   facilities and research labs, including the MIT AI Lab, Stanford,
   and CMU.  Some aspects of the instruction set (most notably the
   bit-field instructions) are still considered unsurpassed.  The 10
   was eventually eclipsed by the VAX machines (descendants of the
   PDP-11) when DEC recognized that the 10 and VAX product lines were
   competing with each other and decided to concentrate its software
   development effort on the more profitable VAX.  The machine was
   finally dropped from DEC's line in 1983, following the failure of
   the Jupiter Project at DEC to build a viable new model. (Some
   attempts by other companies to market clones came to nothing; see
   {Foonly}) This event spelled the doom of {{ITS}} and the
   technical cultures that had spawned the original Jargon File, but
   by mid-1991 it had become something of a badge of honorable
   old-timerhood among hackers to have cut one's teeth on a PDP-10.
   See {{TOPS-10}}, {{ITS}}, {AOS}, {BLT}, {DDT}, {DPB},
   {EXCH}, {HAKMEM}, {JFCL}, {LDB}, {pop}, {push}.

<H2><A NAME="PDP-20">PDP-20</A></H2>
   n. The most famous computer that never was.  {PDP-10}
   computers running the {{TOPS-10}} operating system were labeled
   `DECsystem-10' as a way of differentiating them from the PDP-11.
   Later on, those systems running {TOPS-20} were labeled
   `DECSYSTEM-20' (the block capitals being the result of a lawsuit
   brought against DEC by Singer, which once made a computer called
   `system-10'), but contrary to popular lore there was never a
   `PDP-20'; the only difference between a 10 and a 20 was the
   operating system and the color of the paint.  Most (but not all)
   machines sold to run TOPS-10 were painted `Basil Blue', whereas
   most TOPS-20 machines were painted `DEC TerraCotta' (not `Chinese Red',
   and often mistakenly called orange).

<H2><A NAME="PIP">PIP</A></H2>
   /pip/ [Peripheral Interchange Program] vt.,obs. To copy; from
   the program PIP on CP/M, RSX-11, RSTS/E, and OS/8 (derived from a
   utility on the PDP-6) that was used for file copying (and in OS/8
   and RT-11 for just about every other file operation you might want
   to do).  It is said that when the program was originated, during the
   development of the PDP-6 in 1963, it was called ATLATL (`Anything,
   Lord, to Anything, Lord').
 
<H2><A NAME="POPJ">POPJ</A></H2>
   /pop'J/ [from a {PDP-10} return-from-subroutine
   instruction] n.,v. To return from a digression.  By verb doubling,
   "Popj, popj" means roughly "Now let's see, where were we?"
   See {RTI}.
 
<H2><A NAME="PPN">PPN</A></H2>
   /P-P-N/, /pip'n/ [from `Project-Programmer Number'] n. A
   user-ID under {{TOPS-10}} and its various mutant progeny at SAIL,
   BBN, CompuServe, and elsewhere.  Old-time hackers from the PDP-10
   era sometimes use this to refer to user IDs on other systems as
   well.
 
<H2><A NAME="push">push</A></H2>
   [from the operation that puts the current information on a
   stack, and the fact that procedure return addresses are saved on
   a stack] Also PUSH /push/ or PUSHJ /push'J/ (the latter based
   on the PDP-10 procedure call instruction).  1. To put something
   onto a {stack} or {pdl}.  If one says that something has been
   pushed onto one's stack, it means that the Damoclean list of things
   hanging over ones's head has grown longer and heavier yet.  This may
   also imply that one will deal with it *before* other pending
   items; otherwise one might say that the thing was `added to my queue'.
<p>
   2. vi. To enter upon a digression, to save the current discussion
   for later.  Antonym of {pop}; see also {stack}, {pdl}.

<H2><A NAME="SOS">SOS</A></H2>
   n.,obs. /S-O-S/ 1. An infamously {losing} text editor.
   Once, back in the 1960s, when a text editor was needed for the
   PDP-6, a hacker crufted together a {quick-and-dirty} `stopgap
   editor' to be used until a better one was written.  Unfortunately,
   the old one was never really discarded when new ones (in
   particular, {TECO}) came along.  SOS is a descendant (`Son of
   Stopgap') of that editor, and many PDP-10 users gained the dubious
   pleasure of its acquaintance.  Since then other programs similar in
   style to SOS have been written, notably the early font editor BILOS
   /bye'lohs/, the Brother-In-Law Of Stopgap (the alternate expansion
   `Bastard Issue, Loins of Stopgap' has been proposed). <br> 2. /sos/
   n. To decrease; inverse of {AOS}, from the PDP-10 instruction
   set.

<H2><A NAME="TOPS-10">TOPS-10</A></H2>
   /tops-ten/ n. DEC's proprietary OS for the fabled {PDP-10}
   machines, long a favorite of hackers but now effectively extinct.
   A fountain of hacker folklore.  See also {{ITS}},
   {{TOPS-20}}, {{TWENEX}}, {VMS}, {operating system}.  TOPS-10 was
   sometimes called BOTS-10 (from `bottoms-ten') as a comment on the
   inappropriateness of describing it as the top of anything.

<H2><A NAME="TOPS-20">TOPS-20</A></H2>
   /tops-twen'tee/ n. See {{TWENEX}}.

<H2><A NAME="TWENEX">TWENEX</A></H2>
   /twe'neks/ n. The TOPS-20 operating system by DEC ---
   the second proprietary OS for the PDP-10 --- preferred by most
   PDP-10 hackers over TOPS-10 (that is, by those who were not
   {{ITS}} or {{WAITS}} partisans).  TOPS-20 began in 1969 as Bolt,
   Beranek & Newman's TENEX operating system using special paging
   hardware.  By the early 1970s, almost all of the systems on the
   ARPANET ran TENEX.  DEC purchased the rights to TENEX from BBN and
   began work to make it their own.  The first in-house code name for
   the operating system was VIROS (VIRtual memory Operating System);
   when customers started asking questions, the name was changed to
   SNARK so DEC could truthfully deny that there was any project
   called VIROS.  When the name SNARK became known, the name was
   briefly reversed to become KRANS; this was quickly abandoned when
   it was discovered that `krans' meant `funeral shroud' in
   Swedish.  Ultimately DEC picked TOPS-20 as the name of the
   operating system, and it was as TOPS-20 that it was marketed.  The
   hacker community, mindful of its origins, quickly dubbed it
   {{TWENEX}} (a contraction of `twenty TENEX'), even though by this
   point very little of the original TENEX code remained (analogously
   to the differences between AT&T V6 UNIX and BSD).  DEC people
   cringed when they heard "TWENEX", but the term caught on
   nevertheless (the written abbreviation `20x' was also used).
   TWENEX was successful and very popular; in fact, there was a period
   in the early 1980s when it commanded as fervent a culture of
   partisans as UNIX or ITS --- but DEC's decision to scrap all the
   internal rivals to the VAX architecture and its relatively stodgy
   VMS OS killed the DEC-20 and put a sad end to TWENEX's brief day in
   the sun.  DEC attempted to convince TOPS-20 hackers to convert to
   {VMS}, but instead, by the late 1980s, most of the TOPS-20
   hackers had migrated to UNIX.
