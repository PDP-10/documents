As were the 1, 4, 7 and 15!

When I worked at DEC on 36 bit software, I met a few '15 folks who
seemed almost as sad as we were in the end!

I think I saw '7 in DEC salvage once.  Bore a resemblance to a PDP-6
(dull blue with metal trim).

I'm enclosing Mark Crispin's excellent PDP summary, since it hasn't

     A number of people have requested my list of all the DEC PDP's,
so I thought I'd bore you all with it.

     The PDP-1 was an 18 bit machine.  It was DEC's first computer,
and some of the first timesharing systems were designed for it.  It's
also unique in being one's complement; all later DEC computers were
two's complement.  Some machines, such as one of MIT's PDP-1s, were in
operation until the late '70s.

     The PDP-2 was a designation reserved for a 24 bit machine, but as
far as I can tell it was never even designed and definitely none were
ever built.

     The PDP-3 was a 36 bit machine that was designed but never built
by DEC.  However, Scientific Engineering Institute built one in 1960.

     The PDP-4 was an 18 bit machine that was intended to be a
cheaper, slower alternative to the PDP-1.  It was so slow that it
didn't sell well, although it was interesting for its
auto-incrementing memory registers.  It was not program-compatible
with the PDP-1, but its instruction set was the basis of DEC's future
18 bit computers.

     The PDP-5 was a 12 bit machine designed to be a small laboratory
system.  It used many of the ideas in the LINC (Laboratory Instruction
Computer, designed by Lincoln Labs at MIT, some of which were built by
DEC).

     The PDP-6 was a 36 bit machine and the first machine to implement
the most wonderful computer architecture known to man.  It was rather
expensive and difficult to maintain, and not many were sold.  As a
result, DEC cancelled 36 bit computers for what was to be the first of
many times.

     The PDP-7 was an 18 bit machine and the sucessor to the PDP-4.
It was a major price/performance win over the PDP-4 and the first DEC
computer to use wire-wrapping.

     The PDP-8 was a 12 bit machine and the sucessor to the PDP-8.  It
basically defined the term "minicomputer", and went through several
incarnations.  The original PDP-8 was followed by the extremely slow
PDP-8/S (as bad as the PDP-4 was to the PDP-1, but at least the /S was
program-compatible).  DEC recouped with the PDP-8/I (using MSI
integrated circuits) and the smaller PDP-8/L, and somewhat later came
out with the "Omnibus 8" machines -- the PDP-8/E, the PDP-8/F (a
half-sized version of the PDP-8/E), the PDP-8/M (an OEM version of the
PDP-8/F), and the final machine, the single board PDP-8/A.  The
PDP-8/A still exists after a fashion as a current DEC product.

     The PDP-9 was an 18 bit machine and the sucessor to the PDP-7.
It had a faster memory than the PDP-7 and was the first
microprogrammed DEC computer.  Modulo a 300 wire(!) ECO required in
the first machines, the PDP-9 was a reliable machine and some are
still in operation today.  There was a short-lived PDP-9/L.

     The PDP-10 was a 36 bit machine and the sucessor to the PDP-6.
It is especially noted for its software, which represents the pinnacle
of DEC software engineering and has never been equalled.  The first
KA10, largely installed in universities, created a whole generation of
timesharing hackers.  The follow-on KI10, with paging and using IC's
instead of discrete components but otherwise unexciting, mostly was
sold to commercial organizations.  The KL10 went through several
incarnations and is today the most representative of this marvelous
machine.  The KS10 was a small, low-speed (approximately KA10
performance) processor which was DEC's last successful implementation
of this architecture.

     The PDP-11 was a 16-bit machine that went through more
implementations and operating systems than can be counted.  Presently
it superceded the less powerful PDP-8 as the representative
minicomputer.  While the PDP-11 used octal, it was in its deep heart
of hearts a hexidecimal machine, and the first indicator of the
creeping IBMification of DEC that took full fruit in the VAX.  [I can
hear the flames now...]  Rather than fight it the customers loved it;
more PDP-11's have been sold than any other DEC computer (possibly
more than all the others combined).

     The PDP-12 was a 12 bit machine and the sucessor to the PDP-8.
It combined a LINC and a PDP-8 type processor in the same box and
basically was a new model of the LINC-8 which was the same thing.

     No PDP-13 was ever designed or built.  Even DEC gets
superstitious.

     The PDP-14 was a 12 bit machine with a 1 bit register.  It was
used as a process control engine in applications that were felt to be
too rugged for a PDP-8, and basically replaced a set of relays.  Later
DEC made PDP-8's suitable for this sort of thing, but it didn't stop
them from the ultimate silliness of building a PDP-14 that used a
PDP-8 as its console processor!

     The PDP-15 was an 18 bit machine and the final one of this design
built by DEC.  More PDP-15's were built and sold than any of the
others, and it went through several incarnations including some which
used a PDP-11 as a front end.  Apparently the cancellation of the
PDP-15 came as a great surprise to the "Tiger Team" who worked on it,
although considering its general ungainliness compared to comparable
performance PDP-11's it wasn't surprising.  In many ways the PDP-15
died for the same reason the PDP-10 did.

     The PDP-16 was a "roll your own" 16 bit machine based on various
"building blocks".  Every PDP-16 was essentially custom-designed by
the customer.  It got a fair amount of attention when it was announced
but evidentally didn't sell very well.

     There was no PDP-17 or any other designator.  DEC apparently
decided that "PDP" had a perjorative ring to it.

Subj: Corrections and commentary on Mark Crispin's PDP list

    I have found "grievous" errors in Mark Crispin's descriptions of
PDP-xx computers from DEC, so herewith are some corrections:

PDP-1, 2, 3

    I have no fundamental problem with this description, however, I
would note that there is a story circulating that the original
machine was called PDP, *not* PDP-1.  The manual for the PDP was
PDP-1, and they intended it to stop there.  PDP-2 and PDP-3 are
therefore tentative or actual notation for more manuals.  I will not
comment other than this mention of the PDP-2, 3 memorial golf course
:-)

PDP-4

    I once saw one of these in the Mill with a baudot teletype (model
28) hooked up to it; no further comment.

PDP-5

    The PDP-5 is nearly compatible with the PDP-8.  It has the
program counter in location zero.  Storing value-1 in 0000 is the
same as a jump to value.  This is how FOCAL, 1969 tests for running
on the -5, since interrupts must be moved from 0001 to 0002.  All
other references to 0000 are disallowed, as are certain operate
instructions.  These restrictions seem arbitrary, and this was
corrected in the PDP-8.  It's probably not unreasonable to modify
this machine to be -8 compatible, although a little slow due to 8
microsecond memory.  Extended memory is totally compatible, but EAE
is not, it's more like a peripheral than a processor option.  The bus
can't do 3-cycle data break, but the early 555 DecTape ran on it in
1-cycle mode using the current Data Field as the break field (which
in turns means no interrupts are allowed while the DMA is in
progress!).  Other than that, through use of a physical bus convertor
(don't have the number, but I mean a passive device that merely
changes the connectors), the -5 likes -8 negative bus peripherals.
An -8 expander box (804) was once hooked to a -5 containing the -8's
plotter interface for a Calcomp plotter, etc.  Rumor has it that
someone modified the CPU of a -5 to gain the few operations necessary
to make it -8 compatible, and that an 8K version was running OS/8 on
some undisclosed peripheral.  I wouldn't give too much creedence to
the story because all of the early disk peripherals were 3-cycle
except the aforementioned 555 DecTape (as opposed to TC01 et al which
is three-cycle).

    The PDP-5 is clearly the PDP-8's father.  It is not known if it
used the PC in 0000 kludge as an economy measure, or just plain
foolishness at the time, but clearly, had it been slightly upgraded
to PDP-8 processor compatibility by DEC, it would have been supported
more readily.  Many of the changes subsequently made to FOCAL, 1969,
etc. depend on removing restrictive operations caused by supporting
the -5 and the even more demented 8/s (see below).  These
restrictions mean that you can't use combined operates such as CMA
RAL because these two can't do it.  In the -5's case, it's almost
excusable, but in the -8/s case it is not.

PDP-6

    The story I heard is that Alan Kotok virtually single-handedly
got all of the few made to work by using other people's memory.  Most
wound up in MIT at one time or another anyway.  The PDP-6 lacked
certain features required by later -10 systems, but was always
welcome to ITS.

PDP-7

    It is interesting to note that a small class of peripherals were
introduced for either the -7/9 series or the -8.  I know of at least
two: the AA01A for the -8, and the type 884 sychronous modem
interface.  Each was delivered in two parts.  One part was bus
specific, and the other was plugged into whichever first type you had
installed appropriately.  I personally participated in modifying the
D-A part of a AA01A to become an -8-only peripheral, because the
trivial -8 interface was a waste of valuable black block racks, and
the empty space on the AA01A was available to wrap on an -8-only
interface complete with daisy-chain.  I also once used a PDP-15 with
a negative bus converter which had the negative interface and 884
assembly for a synchronous modem connection to an outside dedicated
line.  It has been told to me that the TC58/59 class of tape
controllers consists of a generic subsystem called TC50 internally,
which is wrapped to a 7/9 bus or -8 bus specific portion to become
the TC58 or TC59.  In this case, the two are wrapped together, not
cabled together, and are thus more or less permanently attached.

PDP-8 and PDP-12

    Since the PDP-8 is the standard bearer of our group, we can't
leave any stone unturned here.  First off, the obvious typo in that
the -8 is the successor to the -5, not itself :=).  While the 8/s may
be extremely slow, it is also *not* compatible with the -8.  Please
note that OS/8 does *not* run on either the -5 or the 8/s.  This also
applies to P?S/8, which it should be noted runs on the entire -8
family from PDP-8 through DECmate III+, whereas OS/8 has different
"family" members that each do part of this in an overlapping fashion.
I am part of a group which desires to release OS/8 Version 5, to run
on the entire family.  Note, when all concerned parties discuss the
"family of 8" the 8/s and -5 are specifically omitted.  I have once
discussed the feasibility of upgrading the 8/s, and the consensus was
that it could be done, but it might run a bit slower, and in any case
would require a rack of cards hanging out of it.  It is also
noteworthy that the 8/s was originally a different project known as
PDP-10!  It was to have 32K memory implemented as drum-style memory
as in earlier computers, and the memory was what became the basis for
the 32K -8 fixed disk peripheral called DF-32.  I guess they didn't
pay close attention to the improvements in processor OPR instructions
the -8 made over the -5, because the 8/s is *worse* than the -5 in
terms of compatibility.  It is also a fully *serial* computer, not
parallel.  It should also be noted that many DATA GENERAL Nova-type
machines and microes were serial or at least not fully parallel.

    Later models, the 8/i and 8/l did come out.  Early 8/i's had
Red-handled modules like the -8, even though the cards were TTL and
eventually became maroon (M modules).  There were even a few -8's
with 8K in them ala the 8/i, because they had 8/i-type memory kludged
into them!  The 8/i originally had a negative bus, for compatibility
with the vast majority of existing peripherals made expressly for the
-8.  The 8/l is essentially a stripped-down 8/i, and as such can have
only 8 (or 12) K and a positive bus, whereas later 8/i's could have
either bus.

    The LINC-8 was an attempt to bring DEC some income from the MIT
LINC project.  After early on realizing that an independent LINC
peripheral would be difficult to pull off, the LINC-8 was born by
making moderate modifications to the -8 CPU and memory interface, and
adding a "captive" processor.  Many operations had to be simulated
for complete pseudo-compatibility with the "real: LINC, which in turn
was constructed of the same System Modules as the PDP-5.  The
LINCtape peripheral is actually an -8 peripheral, whose major
registers are the LINC processor's registers, which are "borrowed"
because the LINC CPU is totally disabled while the -8 runs the tape
peripheral.  In certain ways, the LINC-8 is a "cadillac"
implementation of the -8, in that it has certain niceties such as GMT
3 grasshopper fuses on all power busses, and many fans, etc.  Also,
the lamp drivers for all front panel lamps are on actual small
modules wrapped in, not one massive (and damage-prone) lamp driver
panel.  The bulbs still are soldered in here though :-(

    The PDP-12 is a positive bus-only 8/i with a built-in DMA
multiplexor option eventually, as well as push-down stack hardware
and priority interrupt (KF-12B) as late-production standard features.
All of the LINC stuff is "real" including the dual console.  There
are less actual lights than the LINC-8 because there is now only one
set of registers for a dual-mode processor, not two complete
processors with each's set of major registers displayed.  A standard
option allows read/write of DECtape, whereas only user modifications
could do this on the LINC-8 eventually.  The FPP-12 was born here,
and included PDP-8 CPU lockout mode option, although this was reborn
in the FPP-8/e,a for the Omnibus years later.  Clearly, the -12 was
the one model that got the benefit of "proper" hardware engineering,
whereas subsequent models seem to get ever shorter ends of the
hardware "stick".  Curiously, a few modules come from the LINC-8
project, because it was too much work to recreate the function in TTL
rather than negative voltage logic, so they merely level converted
and used a few R-series cards :-).  Some PDP-12 modules actually say
they are specifics for the "LINC-8/i" which was apparently its
original designation.

    The PDP-12 is the only model where the number is also the word
length :-).  Many DEC-ignorant computer types actually believe that
the PDP-8 is an 8-bit machine!

    Newer models of -8's are all for the Omnibus, which defines all
processor and I/O signals on four DEC-feet or quad-width slot.
Various incarnations are either wider or deeper, but all have the
same bus.  The standard is the 8/e, which is always 20 slots
(optionally 40) in the full-depth box, complete with bulky analog
power supply.  The entry level is the 8/m, which was designated for
OEMs, and didn't include the standard 8/e-type front panel with
incandescant lamps.  The 8/f is an 8/m including an LED variant of
the lamp panel, and this panel is an option for the 8/m as well.
Thus, the 8/m with panel and 8/f differ only in color scheme and
silk-screened name on the panel.  Both have a slightly balky
switching supply which is much smaller than the 8/e supply, as well
as much less power capability.  These machines are "bread-box" size,
and only allow for 20 slots in the box.  

    The newer breed of Omnibus boxes are all usually known
collectively as 8/a, but they came in various flavors: a short-lived
10-slot box with many restrictions, a 12-slot box with somewhat more
versatility, and a 20-slot box with large power capability.

    Theoretically, any of these systems could be expanded from
virtually any model's box as an add-on to the base system, so
standard options included upgrading a 40-slot to 80-slot, or making a
20-slot 8/f grow to 40 or optionally 60 slots using the same external
8/e-type box, etc.  The FPP-8/A was meant to go in the 8/a 12-slot
box, which like all 8/a boxes is hex-wide internally, not quad.  The
sixth foot is non-existent and the fifth foot has only a few signals
optionally available later to various memory extension options beyond
32K.  When sold this way as an add-on for a 40-slot 8/e, the entire
option is known as FPP-8/e, including the BC-80C cable and 12-slot
hex-wide box, as well as the two hex-wide FPP cards.  My own machine
is a 40-slot 8/e, with a 20-slot 8/a box as an expander.

    The 8/a series also sports an optional octal digit LED readout
front panel, similar to an 11/34 in general appearance.

    Most of the 8/a models use a single slot CPU, the KK8A, which has
the bus pullups on it (at the *wrong* end electrically of the bus!)
which disallows the bus terminator, and is thus limited to what fits
in any one box, or at most 20 slots.  Some use the 8/e processor
(KK8F) which requires a terminator card (M8320) in the furthest slot
away from the CPU.  Some configurations reverse the apparent
beginning and ending, but always obey this rule.  This allows at
least 40 slots (8/e box or two 8/a boxes) or at most 80 slots (two
8/e boxes).  It is possible to discover which CPU is present due to
specific CPU-model-dependent quirks, but you can't tell more than
that.  Some 8/a boxes are really 8/e machines with 8/a memory options
and all else is from an 8/e!  8/a systems get numeric suffixes like
-100, -400, -500, and -600 as well as model-option changes to make it
something like -625, etc.  Since there is much "plug and play" here,
it is not too useful to describe an 8/a system by model, but rather
by specific components.

    All -8 models are backwards compatible with earlier bus
arrangements, and also there is a feeble attempt at forwards
compatibility called the DW-8/E.  This partially allows some Omnibus
stuff to work in the pre-Omnibus machines, but has many restrictions.
A hacked-up version of the RK8E called RK8F is the only DMA option
for the DW8E.  The Omnibus machines support the positive bus via the
KA8E and KD8E(s).  The KA8E outputs a completely compatible positive
transfer bus, and each KD8E outputs a compatible DMA interface.  The
Omnibus does any priority multiplexing.  The Negative bus is in turn
supported by thge DW08A option, so it is reasonable to fine a TC01 on
an 8/a.  I have an 8/e with a TC01 and TU55 myself.  (This requires
an ECO to the W103 cards to become W123.)

PDP-9 and PDP-9/l

    The 9/l had a pink color scheme, and was apparently a
stripped-down -9.  The -9 was often sold with a -7 because there was
some software that ran on both simultaneously.  Apparently, the -7
became a dedicated controller for the DECtape drives relative to the
-9, because the -7 had a feeble interface ala the TD8E on the 8/e,
etc.  Later, the -9 got its own TC02 DECtape, thus relieving the -7
requirement.

    I don't understand Mark Crispin's description of the -9 as being
microprogrammed.  Perhaps this is merely a misstatement of the fact
that the operate instructions, like in the -8, can be *user*
microprogrammed together such as:

    SMA SZA CLA         /skip if the AC is either negative or zero,
                        /and then clear the AC regardless.

    The -9 is not materially different in architecture from the -8,
so I can't imagine this meaning anything else.  I also understand
that the 7/9/15 can microprogram more of these operations than the
-8 can.  The -8 is restricted to groups which can combine
sub-operations, whereas the 18-bit machines can combine almost
anything at once!


PDP-10

    The PDP-10 spawned much software development, and eventually
encouraged the use of BLISS.  It is noteworthy that much of the VAX
software is lifted directly from TOPS-20 because of the close
compatibility of the various (later) BLISS implementations.  However,
purists will note that BLISS-10 is *not* BLISS-36, while BLISS-32
just about is.  This was done on purpose to rip off the -10 stuff for
the benefit of the VAX.  Perhaps this also means that some newer
stuff can come back to the 36-bit world as well :-)

PDP-11

    Since the early days of the RISC discussion, it has become
debatable whether the PDP-11 is more powerful than many designs, not
just the -8.  I guess it all depends on how you measure the power.
The PDP-11 certainly had more hardware engineering effort applied,
but was the benefit worth the cost?  Measured this way, you could say
the -11 is DEC's weakest machine.  Look at how well the PDP-8 has
fared while being "negatively marketed" as compared to the -11!
Also, LCG had to put controls on -11 marketing when salesmen were
quoting -11 systems that were a) impossible to implement (or at least
highly impractical), and b) were clearly short-changing a customer
willing to shell out PDP-10-sized bucks for a computer.  DEC also
made lots of money selling the 11-03, but I guess -11 freaks don't
want to talk much about that :-)

    Various academic works have pinpointed the weaknesses of the -11
in terms of pure architectural considerations.  The user group
largely consists of people who don't really know much about the -11,
but rather are in love with its software, and make the fatal mistake
of measuring the worth of a machine by how useful it is to them, not
its intrinsic value.  This merely means that DEC threw a lot of money
at the -11, not that it is a good design.  If RT-11 were known as
RT-15 for the PDP-15 family, and DEC implemented an RT-11-like system
for the -15 (which is totally feasible, considering what a -15 is,
and what RT-11 is), how many of these people would be raving about
how powerful the -15 is? :-)

    As a side note, there seems to be much interest in an RT-11-like
system for the VAX, presumably to be called RT-32.

    As is alluded to in THE SOUL OF A NEW MACHINE, the PDP-11 was
born over a weekend, appealing to the ego of certain individuals who
could pull strings in DEC, to pull the plug on what was to be known
as DATA GENERAL and the NOVA.  Considering the rocky road of the -11,
it is curious that DEC never sued DATA GENERAL over the NOVA's very
existence.
