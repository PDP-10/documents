C-Kermit>

Yes, C-Kermit now includes an FTP client:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ck71.html

The current test version (Alpha.01) pointed to by the URL above doesn't have
the FTP VDIRECTORY command in it, but by working copy does, and so Alpha.02
will have it.  I'll try to remember to post an announcement here.

C-Kermit is available for UNIX (all kinds), VMS, and several other OS
families.  The Windows version is called Kermit 95.  So far only the UNIX
and Windows versions are getting FTP clients.

(And no, it doesn't do TYPE TENEX -- does anybody care?)

- Frank

P.S. TOPS-20 users who try C-Kermit might notice a familiar look & feel.

It would seem somewhat impractical to require a VAX sitting next to your PC

I confess I never tried Linux DECnet, most of the comments I've heard about
it have not been reassuring.

Remember: if you can get Telnet or serial port access into TOPS-10 (or -20),
you can use Kermit to transfer files in and out:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/

TOPS-20 Kermit is a plain old MACRO program:

  ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/d/k20mit.mac

that anybody can build on any TOPS-20 system.  I don't think it requires
any "modern" JSYS's but who remembers.  Documentation is here:

  ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/d/k20mit.doc <-- plain text (not Word!)
  ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/d/k20mit.ps  <-- PostScript
  ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/d/k20mit.mss <-- Scribe source

There are also pre-built binaries here (1):

  ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/bin/kermit20.exe
  ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/bin/kermit20ftp.exe

It's quite slow (2), but that's another matter -- if anybody was interested,
development could be revived to add some of the modern performance features.
At least it gets files in and out reliably.

TOPS-10 Kermit is another matter, unfortunately.  It's written in the
dreaded Bliss-36 because the same code was also used for VMS (Bliss-32) and
P/OS (Bliss-16).  It was done at Stevens Institute of Technology, who were
big on all three platforms at the time (circa 1984-86).

Unfortunately I don't seem to have a copy of the TOPS-10 Kermit executable.
Maybe there's one on a DECUS tape in Tim Shoppa's archives?  It would
probably be called K10MIT.EXE.  Meanwhile the sources and docs are here:

  ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/d/k10*.*

(1) I really should remember this better, but as I recall there were several
"standards" for storing 36-bit binaries on 8-bit-byte file systems.  The one
that Kermit-20 uses is the same one DUMPER uses to put binary files on tape:
the 36-bit word is divided into five 7-bit bytes, which are dealt into five
8-bit bytes, with the last having its 8th bit set to the original word's
leftover bit.  That's the format of the kermit20.exe file (which transferred
itself Unix).

The kermit20ftp.exe file was uploaded to Unix with TOPS-20 FTP using:

  set type image 36 local
  set type image 8 remote

I ftp'd this one back to TOPS-20 using the same FTP settings and it starts
up OK.  I'm not sure how you could FTP the kermit20.exe file -- probably
you can't.

(2) Remember, the RSX20F front end is the reason why original Kermit was
so slow.  It was slow on purpose.  Modern Kermit is a fast as you want it be.

This is to announce (no kidding) Version 5.1 of DECSYSTEM-20 KERMIT,
replacing version 4.2 of September 1988.  Version 5.1 adds long packets,
which were never done before because long packets would crash a real
DEC-20.  But virtually no real DEC-20s exist any more; all current DEC-20s
are either non-DEC clones, or else running on other hardware under
emulation.  So now you can use DEC-20 Kermit to transfer files with packets
up to 9K in length; the previous maximum was 94 bytes.  This gives speed
improvements up to about a factor of 20 (i.e. 2000%).

This update was made in anticipation of the release of publicly available
KL10 emulators capable of running under Linux or other common platforms.
Since any emulator will probably not include Internet support, a way is
needed to import and export files: DEC-20 Kermit (the very first Kermit
program (*)) lives again!  Now when you log in to the DEC-20 (or emulator)
from a PC or other computer running a Kermit-capable terminal emulator, you
can run DEC-20 Kermit to exchange files with your computer, and the
transfers will not be as agonizingly slow as they would have been without
this update.

Installation instructions:

  Download the new Kermit source (one file) in text mode from the
  Kermit Project archive in text ("ASCII") mode:

    ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/d/k20mit.mac

  Note: this is a MACRO-20 source file; it is not any kind of "package",
  tarball, ZIP archive, compressed, encrypted, or anything else.  It's
  just PLAIN TEXT (if you use DEC-20s you know what plain text is).
  Rename it to KERMIT.MAC, then:

    load kermit
    save

This produces a KERMIT.EXE file, which is DEC-20 Kermit.  Install it
somewhere in SYS:, or else redefine SYS: to include the directory where
KERMIT.EXE is.  Give it execute permission, e.g. P775252.  Documentation
for the update is here:

    ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/d/k20mit.txt

(*) The first Kermit file transfer occurred on April 29, 1981, between
    two copies of DEC-20 Kermit over a loopback connection between two
    serial ports on the Columbia University DEC-20.

Yes, this is the entire reason for the original 94-byte limit on the length
of a Kermit packet.  The initial design of the Kermit protocol was very much
a lowest-common-denominator affair -- a protocol that would not break the
DEC-20 and would also work with the IBM mainframe.  But it was also
deliberately extensible, and that's why we've been able to grow it over the
years.  Unfortunately, many people have yet to see past the original design
and still, after nearly 20 years, believe the protocol is intrinsically slow.

NFT.  NFT is like Kermit.  It's a file-transfer program.  The difference
is that NFT is a DECnet client -- you need an NFT server on the other
end, over a DECnet connection.  In other words, NFT works only within
the DEC universe (yes, I too have heard that "DECnet is available for
Linux" but I have yet to be convinced that it works).

Kermit does not need DECnet.  It works over TCP/IP or serial ports
and/or modems (and in some implementations also X.25 and other
networking methods), and versions of Kermit are available for
practically every computer and operating system that has ever existed.

Kermit is available for the DECsystem-10 and the DECSYSTEM-20.  It's
available for DOS and Windows.  It's available for every known variety
of UNIX.  It's available for VMS, RSX, RT11, RSTS, TSX+, IAS, ...
It's available for MVS, CMS, CICS, VOS, AOS/VS, ...  It's available
for Plan 9, OS-9, QNX, ...

So as you can see, it's both platform-independent AND works on
different kinds of connections, AND does not require a proprietary
networking method.  We've been working on it for 20 years so it shouldn't
be surprising that it can be useful in certain situations.  Those
who are not familiar with Kermit can get a brief overview here:

Go here for the ".tap" image for Kermit-10 for TOPS-10 (and
TOPS-20), complete with TOPS-10 7.03 .EXE and .REL/.UNV files.

http://pdp10.kilonet.org/files/k10mit-135.tap.gz

Frank, I incremented the edit level to 135, which involved the
following:

Changing CAXx macros to CAM and CAI where appropriate. This was
to fix a bug somewhere in TOPS-10 GLXUNV(?) macros where it would
use CAI where CAM was necessary.

Created a K10MIT.MIC file so you can do "DO K10MIT" and it would
compile correctly.

I tested it with a shareable high-seg, but the above link only
includes a private high-seg. Change "/SAVE" in k10mit.ccl to
"/SSAVE" to enable shareable high-seg. Your mileage may vary.

The default restore point for the above tape is [76,5,KERMIT].
This was my account as a systems guy at LIRICS.

Caveats:

This was tested using simh-2.6 with the DZ11 support I mashed in.
I got 2200 CPS from a Sparc-10 2x60Mhz w/Solaris 8 connecting
into a Celeron 533 running simh.

This should work with TS10 as a tape image, and using c-kermit
to telnet into the console (or KLINIK) should work fine.

The DZ11 support for simh does not work with C-Kermit 7.0, as 
Kermit tries to do something strange with the telnet session
on setup. C-kermit 6.0.192 works fine.

A workaround for the C-kermit 7.0 problem is to telnet into
your local machine, and then telnet into the simulator from
a UNIX shell.

I tested it yesterday and had no problems, but today I saved the file
and got only 500K of it. The original .tap image is 1.4megs, while the
gzip'd file is 500K+. When I saved the file, it came across as
uncompressed, but only 500K size. 

I did it again, right-clicking on the file and this time got the full
1.4megs and the tape image worked fine.

I put it up with a different suffix so that Netscape doesn't try to
un-gzip it on the fly. Try:

http://pdp10.kilonet.org/files/k10mit-135.tap.gzip

Again, right-click on the link above, and "save link as". It will
come down gzip'd and you'll have to do:

gzip -dc <k10mit-135.tap.gzip >k10mit-135.tap

or,
mv k10mit-135.tap.gzip k10mit-135.tap.gz
gzip -d k10mit-135.tap.gz

This I find a bit worrisome -- Kermit-10 was build and used all
over the place in the 80s without complaint.  If the CAX macros
are generating bad code, then (a) might it not be a problem in
the emulator, and (b) wouldn't this affect a lot more programs
that Kermit?  Has anybody tried building GALAXY components?

I would be interested in pursuing this.  Can you give details?
You can tell C-Kermit 7.0 to "set telnet debug on" to watch the
Telnet negotiations.  You can also change the Telnet policies
of C-Kermit 7.0 with "set telopt" commands ("set telopt ?" for
a list -- feel your way thru as with a TOPS-20 program).

I'm sure we can do better than that.  C-Kermit 7.0 works fine for
Telnetting into a *real* DEC-20 and uploading or downloading files
with long packets (using the recently updated Kermit-20).

If you can't make a telnet connection directly from Kermit to the TOPS-20
emulator, that's a good indicator that other things won't work either.
The DZ-11/Telnet-Server shim has to be fixed to implement Telnet protocol
properly.  Perhaps more to the point, the underlying OS (Linux in this case)
also has to have an adequate PTY driver.  Recent experience(*) has shown
that quite a new UNIX-based OS's fall down flat when their ptys are stressed,
e.g. by transferring files through them with Kermit.  Two examples are
AIX and OpenBSD.

In the meantime, C-Kermit has enough controls to let you work around almost
any problem.  When a Telnet server misnegotiates Telnet protocol, you can
use C-Kermit's SET TELNET and SET TELOPT commands to adapt Kermit's
negotiation policies to practically any situation: "help set telnet",
"help set telopt" for details.  If C-Kermit seems to stall making the
initial connection, it is often sufficient to use (in C-Kermit):

  telnet /nowait hostname

Once you have a connection that works interactively, you might still have
trouble with TRANSMIT.  This is to be expected, because TRANSMIT is not
an error-detecting-and-correcting protocol.  Here again you have lots of
adjustments available to work around almost any problem: "help transmit"
and "help set transmit" explains them.

Finally, when bootstrapping Kermit with TRANSMIT, it's better to have a
short bootstrap file than a long one.  KERMIT.MAC is 12000 lines (407K).
KERMIT.EXE, on the other hand, is 140K, but obviously you can't TRANSMIT
it.  The trick would be to find a text-encoded compression method that
can be used on the executable, similar to gzipping and uuencoding on Unix,
but that is friendly to 36-bit binaries.

I notice that gzip and uuencode are actually available on toad, but
gzip doesn't handle 36-bit executables:

  @ gzip kermit.exe
  GZIP: kermit.exe has byte size > 8; bytes > 255 will be truncated
   do you wish to proceed (y or n)? n
	  skipped
  @

I'm probably not remembering some common technique from the 70s and 80s
for shipping 36-bit binaries around...

(*) C-Kermit 8.0 Beta includes a new SSH command, which works by starting
    the external SSH program on a pty, thus allowing SSH to be the transport
    for Kermit connections, and therefore allowing file transfer, scripting,
    character-set translation, etc, over SSH.  This works great on some
    UNIXes, not so great on others, and not at all on still others.

It's here:

The commands you would want are:

  set carrier-watch off   ; Don't require carrier -- stay connected

  set flow xon/xoff       ; If the 2020 FPE supports it this should help
  set parity none         ; (or use "even" if required)
  connect

Use Ctrl-\, then letter "c", to escape back to the C-Kermit prompt.

You can also push stuff at the 2020 in a smarter way than you're doing
now, with Kermit's TRANSMIT command.  At the C-Kermit> or K-95> prompt,
type "help transmit" and "help set transmit" for info.

If you have trouble, let me know; I'll be glad to help.  In particular,
if you need to push arbitrary 8-bit data thru the connection, some
additional setup (and precautions) will be needed.
