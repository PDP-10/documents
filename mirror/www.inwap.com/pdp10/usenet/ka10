Does anyone have information on light bulbs for DEC front panels
circa 1968, in particular for a KA10 panel?

The bulbs in question have two metal pins.  Some bear the legend
"OL-1", and others have two rows of info, "PL10161" on above "1209169".

There's temporarily a photo of one, next to a US penny for scale, at
    http://www.36bit.org/dec/bulb.jpg

Would these be the same bulbs used on the PDP-8, PDP-8/I, or PDP-8/e?

I'd like to get a manufacturer and part number of a currently available
replacement.  Or a source of old stock.

I've been told that there were also plug-compatible LED lamps in red and
green.  These obviously must have contained a series current limiting
resistor.  Any info?

Thanks!
Eric

If they're anything like the -8 front panels, there is also a "warming"
current through the bulb.  The aftermarket LED "upgrades" either had you
snip the resistors that kept the prelight current flowing on the front
panel drivers, or (more classy) they had divider networks in addition
to current limiting to make sure the warming current didn't appreciably
light the LED.

It was about three years ago I posted an analysis of the divider method
to alt.sys.pdp8.  I'd be glad to dredge up those calculations here if
there is any interest.  The divider method is a little more complicated
to solder up, but it's easier to go back to real light bulbs if/when you
decide to go back to the "completely original" look.

Tim.

  Lucky you - it's still an available part from 800-DIGITAL. P/N 12-09169-00
is a "LAMP; 15V @ .040AMP MAX; .075". It's $2.00 with a 1 day lead time.

Thanks!  Without the dash after the 12, I didn't realize that the number
marked on the lamp was a DEC part number.

Based on those specs, it appears that an Oshino OL-6003BP should be a
suitable replacement.  It's rated about .037A rather than 0.40, but it
otherwise matches, including the .075 MSCP.  It's rated for 50,000 hours.
They're available in the US from Wamco.

Next question:  anyone know what drive circuit DEC used?  Or at least
what voltage they used for the warming current?

Since I only have the front panel and not the rest of the computer
(pardon me while I break down and cry for a moment...), I need to build
my own circuit to drive it.  Eventually I plan to have a suitable blue
metal box made to bolt the panel onto, and inside put a KA10 emulator.

Of course, since the light boards in the front panel don't have any
drive electronics, I could just plug in T-1 3/4 LEDs, but I'd prefer to
use lamps for some small semblance of authenticity.
