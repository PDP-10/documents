The SRI-NIC machine was a DEC 2065 running TOPS-20.  I worked at SRI in
the Network Information Systems Center (which ran the SRI-NIC and
DDN NIC) around that time and I became very impressed with TOPS-20.  
I still consider it to have had one of the best low-level archiving systems
ever.  

If you are nostalgic to telnet in and use a whois server try connecting
via telnet to port 43 of whois.networksolutions.com and using some of
the old whois flags.  dump do(main) domain.tld will still show the old
database entries, including the references to tacs and tips.
