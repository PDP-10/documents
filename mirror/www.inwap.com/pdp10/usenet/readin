   This isn't entirely correct. The RH-10 supported READIN mode. I'm
sure it "faked it" as all the data from the disk passed through the
DF-10 data channel, but the scheme worked. Of course it only booted
from RP?0, but that's a technicality.

   From what I've seen in other systems, it probably faked a transfer
of a 'JRST (wherever), JRST .' and the machine looped happily until
the DF-10 overwrote the location of the "JRST .". (Here's one of the
points where "standard" punctuation fails, miserably!) Just a guess,
though.

That may have worked with the first model of disks, but not with the
RP02 or RP03.  The usual thing was to have a short bootstrap program
routine in the paper-tape reader at all times.  Pressing the READ-IN
button with the device code set to PTR would read in the pre-boot
program from the paper-tape reader.  That program would then read in
BOOTS from blocks 3, 4, 5 on the lowest numbered disk on the first
disk channel.

At the Colorado School of Mines, the terminal-line scanner was a PDP-8
with a few unused memory locations.  It was set up to supply the pre-boot
routine for READ-IN mode instead of using the paper-tape reader.

   I remember it working with the RP04s at ADP. My belief is that the
"brains" behind this lived in the RH-10, and the RH-10 returned a tiny
program via the I/O bus and commanded the disk to transfer sector
zero through the DF-10 into memory, at some point overwriting a self-
jump that the RH-10 had given the processor.

   Of course I may have my head up my backside, but I do not ever
recall booting a live system using either paper tape or DECtape.

   I've read about that hack and like it a lot. That's a creative use
of resources!

First of all, one did not boot a live system; users had a habit of
shooting the crasher [joking emoticon here just giving a little
prod].

One could boot a dead system from disk, paper tape, DECtape or 
magtape (I'm talking about KAs and KIs here...not KLs).

Yes, well, it got implemented to the extreme with the KL; for
that we gave up real live lights.  TW hated it.
