I didn't think EXT2 used cylinder groups, either.

The syncronous metadata writing are a very important part of FFS stability.[1]
I have spent much too much time fixing ext2fs filesystems that have died 
while doing huge amounts of file creation and deletion to be convinced 
otherwise.  I have never seen the behavior on FFS FSes mounted sync, and have 
with ext2fs, and ffs mounted async.

[1] Gregory R. Ganger and Yale N. Patt wrote a paper a couple of years ago
which explained that you needn't actually do the metadata syncronously, but
merely in dependent order.  Their paper is available at 
http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/papers/CSE-TR-254-95/.  An implementation of 
this by Kirk McKusick is available in FreeBSD 3.0 and later (and probably 
elsewhere).  I haven't had any spectacular system failures since I started 
to use it, haven't heard of many problems with it.
