I can.  The VT101, which we bought truckloads of here at Columbia U as
soon as it came out, added local echo.  This let it access our IBM
mainframe through the 3705 (half duplex) front end.  Prior to the VT101,
our VT100s could only access our PDP-11s and DEC-20s.

The VT100 and 101, however, were both quite painful to use with EMACS on
the low-speed dialup connections of the day (300bps, maybe 1200).  The
VT102 added the crucial feature: character insert/delete.  It's hard to
imagine in this day & age of gigabit Ethernets etc what a HUGE difference
that made.

On a related nostalgic note: The VT100's smooth scrolling feature was
quite amazing to everyone when they first saw it, so much so that the
VT100 became quite the status symbol.  As soon as we hooked a few of them
up to the campus "network" (a big serial port switch) and thence to the
DEC-20, the DEC-20 would crash every couple minutes.  Why?  When the
VT100 was in smooth scrolling mode, it would send Xoffs and Xons at such
a hellish rate, it crashed the DEC-20 front end, which was designed based
on the statistics of people typing (i.e. 10cps per port).

At Berkeley the TERMCAP entry for the vt100 with smooth scroll had simply
incredible delays for anything that did scrolling, so it avoided most of
the really bad handshaking behaviour.

I found that smooth scroll made it harder for me to eyegrep documents at 300
and 1200 baud... my point of view would "stick" to the scrolling text
instead of scanning back and forth over the last line looking for keywords.

The above looks more like a modified VT100 keyboard, one set up for
WPS-8 or some other Word Processing System.

Differences between the above and a real VT100 keyboard:

Top row is SET-UP, indicator lights, cursor-Up, cursor-Down,
  cursor-Left, cursor-Right, gap to numeric keypad, PF1, PF2, PF3, PF4.

On 2nd row, to the right of "0" (zero) is hyphen/underscore,
  equal/plus, backtick/tilde, BACKSPACE, BREAK, gap, 7, 8, 9, minus.

3rd row starts with a TAB and ends with [/{, ]/}, top 1/3rd of RETURN
  and DELETE.  Then a gap to numeric 4, 5, 6 and comma.

On the 4th row, after "L" is ;/:, '/", 2/3rds of RETURN, backslash/vert-bar,
  gap, 1, 2, 3 and top half of ENTER.

The 5th row ends witn comma/<, period/>, slash/question, double wide shift
LINEFEED, gap, double wide 0, period and bottom half of ENTER.

Here's an interesting post from Jerry Leichter from 1999, in which he says 
that DEC had an internal document that looked like the published VT102 
documentation, but included fragments of Pascal that defined the behaviour 
in detail. I would like to see this document, but I've never even found a 
name for it.

http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=379E1C79.57D8%40smarts.com

As far as subsequent DEC terminals go, "VT100 compatible" actually means 
VT100 plus the Level 1 Editing Extension that was part of the VT102.

Although this means that the VT102 User Guide is probably the best source 
of information for VT100 emulators (along with a real VT102 and vttest), I 
think that that manual has some mistakes. DEC's later terminals certainly 
don't follow the VT102 User Guide's description of the behaviour of Delete 
Character (DCH).

The VT100 Technical Manual doesn't help in this area, which is a shame 
because the LA120 Technical Manual describes all seven states of that 
machine's escape sequence parser.

I have written a document that tries to fill some of the holes in the 
available specifications by checking the behaviour of DEC's later 
terminals, but there is still a lot that could be written in this area.

vttest. You'll find a link to it at the above URL or go directly to
