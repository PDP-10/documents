I have found *one* such book, but it is *not* very large:

_Introduction to DECsystem-10 Assembler Language Programming_,
by Michael Singer, John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY, 1978,
ISBN:  0-471-03458-4

This same man wrote a book on PDP-11 assembler language programming.

The full cite is: Gorin, Ralph E.  Introduction to DECSYSTEM-20
Assembly Language Programming.  Bedford, Mass. : Digital Press, c1981.
This is an excellent text.

For out of print books, bookfinder.com is even better than ABE.
Bookfinder searches several networks of OP dealers, including ABE but
others as well.  Do not use amazon for OP books; they search the same
databases as Bookfinder but triple the price.

Good luck,

Actually, between that reference and the DECUS PDP-10 freeware
at http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/ I think you'd be doing pretty
well.

In addition to the hundreds of megabytes of sources available there,
you'll probably be particularly interested in the 10-65 package,

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/www/lib10/0101/index.html

which is a interpretive-type assembler that is specifically for
those learning the PDP-10 instruction set.

There was a book called "Meet Macro-10" by Dr. Myron E. White.  The
editions I saw had several inaccuracies in it, and I do not know if
a later (post 1977) version was published that corrected those.
