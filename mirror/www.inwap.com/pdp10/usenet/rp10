I graduated in JUN68 with BSEE and joined PDP-10 Engineering
(rather than being one of 300 engineers designing the IBM
System/360 Model 195 which was my only other computer
offer).

There were two major transitions going on then:
* Digital was growing from small to large
* The industry was going from discrete components to ICs

I was the 11th engineer in PDP-10 Engineering--each was
given lots of responsibility. My first assignment was as
Project Engineer of the RP10--a PDP-10 disk controller for
RP-02 (Digital's name for OEMed Memorex 660--IBM 2314 type)
25 MB disks. The RP10 listed for $29K, the RP-02 for $25K.
They ended up selling 300 RP10s and 1500 RP-02s for a list
of $8.7M of controllers + $37.5M of disks which I felt was
quite a bit of responsibility when June grads were making
$6,800 to $8,600 (actual numbers from my school's placement
office for jobs accepted in JUN68).

The next Spring I saw a job posting. The PDP-11 product line
(no product had yet been announced) was looking for a JUN69
graduate to design a disk controller to the same RP-02. Only
the candidate was to be a Junior Engineer understudying a
Senior Engineer for his first project. Digital had made the
transition from small to large. New hire June grads were in
training for the first year.

All my Senior labs were with ICs. When I started at Digital
I asked for an approved parts list. My manager said, "We
don't use ICs. The last time we evaluated them they didn't
have enough noise rejection." (Of course not if you take
every pin of every chip and bring it out to a Gardner-Denver
wirewrap backplane 15.5 inches wide and 21.0 inches high or
bigger!) As a result the RP-10 was 6' high, 19" wide, had
144 lights, and almost 500 discrete component circuit cards!

Anyway I'm only 49yo, but I designed a major piece of
digital logic for a major computer vendor with discrete
components.

Back in '69 when the RP10 and RP-02 first shipped the disk
was $25K/25MB or $1000./MB. A recent Fry's ad in the San
Jose Mercury offers a Conner IDE hard drive at $249./1.6GB
or $0.156/MB (over 6400 times cheaper)--but that's another
story.

36-bits or none at all! :-)

In the late 70's my desk was about 10 feet from an RP02.  If you 
recall, it had a mechanical cyl lock that would set when it was on
cyl (tick).

tick, tick tick, tickticktickticktickticktick     arggggggggg!

..thing drove me nuts
