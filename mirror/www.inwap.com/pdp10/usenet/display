We had 4 of them in one room, running off of a KL with tops-20.  They
were used by the engineers to produce all the drawings for all the
hardware.  On the back side, it was SUDS.  Every print was signed by
"S. Foonley" in the box for the person who drew it.  Wish I still had
my KL print set.  :-(

The device is basically at PDP-11 based GT40 (GT42) connected via a
DL10 such that the graphics commands would be fetched out of the
-10/20 memory.

I do remember getting asked about the the conditionals in the monitor
used to enable supports for this hack.  There was some very cryptic
comments about the "Heliwell system"  (I never sould spell Dick's name
right.)  Customers who had source were wondering what that system was.
The shipped code had the hooks for the support, but didn't have the
drivers, as this was a special one-off system that we didn't expect
anyone else to run. In reality, there were 3 or 4 of these systems
spread arround DEC, and almost every system or board designed in the
late 70's, early 80's had the prints produced on them.  IIRC, Dick's
folks made sure the drivers and such worked, and built their own
systems from source. BTW, that system may also have been one of the
first "1091" systems, as it was the big blue boxes, but ran Tops-20,
also, IIRC, the cpu was serial number "P3", The third prototype KL
ever built.  It was later replaced with a real production unit, but I
forget the serial number.  For those who remember the LAB layout in
MR, it was in the NW corner of the room.

Close:  Dick *Helliwell* (4 l's total).

Dick ported the GNU utilities, GNU Emacs, Perl 4.xxx, and X11R5 to Tops-20
while working at XKL.
