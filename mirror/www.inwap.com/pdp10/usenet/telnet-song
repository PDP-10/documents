If you want to do what the intro says, you'll have to write Guy Steele, since
Donald Knuth no longer uses e-mail.  Luckily, Guy Steele is the real composer;
Knuth only wrote the article.

   Title - Telnet Song
   Original - ?
   Group - ?
   Author - Guy L. Steele / D.E. Knuth
   Intro - D.E. Knuth, 'The Complexity of Songs', Communications of the
   ACM 27 (4) pp. 345--348, April, 1984 (repetitions indicated; the song
   is only sung correctly if the appropriate number of repetitions is
   used) Some comments: Strictly speaking, the song is not part of the
   article; it was appended afterwards. The composer and lyricist is Guy
   L. Steele, Jr. The melody has a certain haunting quality that is quite
   hard to convey in ASCII text. I don't know whether it has ever been
   played. The composer has email, so it shouldn't be too hard to find
   out.

                                Telnet Song
                                      
     There is a program called TELNET to get to another CPU.
     Control up-arrow is the escape; it's doubled to send it through,
     and "quit" is control up-arrow Q.
     
     A hacker once used TELNET to get to another CPU.
     He knew he could quit whenever he wanted to: all he had to do was
     type
     control up-arrow Q.
     
     Instead the hacker used TEL-NET to get to another CPU.
     He knew he could quit whenever he wanted to: all he had to do was
     type
     control up-arrow [at i-th time, repeat 2^i times]
     Q.
     
     [repeat verse n times; the choice of n is free]
     
     The hacker soon got bored with this, and wanted to get back.
     He sighed, and started the exponential popping of the stack:
     
     The hacked flushed the TEL-NET to the most distant CPU:
     He couldn't log out until he had killed them all,
     counting up powers of two: he typed
     control up-arrow [at i-th time, repeat 2^(n-i+1) times]
     Q.
     
     [repeat n times]
     
     Whew!
     
     The hacker's eyes were bloodshot; his fingers, black and blue;
     He wanted to log out and and go home to bed, and sleep for a day or
     two.
     He typed L O G O U T ... carriage return ...
     
     The hacker was on a network with only twenty CPU's.
     But if he had telnetted to them all,
     he would not yet be through with typing
     control up-arrow [repeat 7 times]
     Q!
