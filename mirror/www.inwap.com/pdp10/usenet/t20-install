Tim,

I don't have a 4.1 installation for Tops-20, but the contents did not change
much if at all between 4.1 and 7.0 on the KL-10; I imagine that they were the
same or similar on the KS-10.

The Installation Tape contains 6 files:

	MONITR.EXE
	EXEC.EXE
	DLUSER.EXE
	DLUSER save set
	DUMPER.EXE
	DUMPER save sets (one long file, multiple sets internally)

There was a bug in DLUSER that actually made the installation manual wrong at
one point, so here's how to install a Tops-20 system once you are at the EXEC
prompt ("@").  The indented comments are for your information; obviously, you
should not type them.

@enable
	turns on OPERATOR privileges--you are logged in as OPERATOR at this
	point--and changes prompt to "$"

$rewind mta0:
	to make your life easier should you need to re-boot

$copy mta0: <system>monitr.exe
$copy mta0: <system>exec.exe
	now you can re-boot from disk and get an EXEC started

$copy mta0: <SUBSYS>dluser.exe
	NOTE THE DIRECTORY!

$copy mta0: USERS.TXT
	this is the DLUSER data file's default name, which makes life easier

$copy mta0: <SUBSYS>dumper.exe
	let's get all the copying out of the way now, and start the installa-
	tion process

$dluser
DLUSER> structure ps:
	default, but let's do everything by the book, as it were

DLUSER> load users.txt
	defines the directory layout of the public structure

DLUSER> exit

	The Installation Tape contains <SYSTEM>, <SUBSYS>, and <UETP.LIB> in
	DUMPER save sets.  Repeat the RESTORE command below to load all sets.

$dumper
[Using MTA-DUMPER:]
DUMPER> tape mta0:
	must specify a tape, and MTA-DUMPER: is not (yet) defined

DUMPER> restore ps:<*>*.*.*
	This will get the <SYSTEM> files

	I'm assuming that you have named the public structure "PS:", but if you
	called it something else (e.g., "FOO:") the command should read
		restore ps:<*>*.*.* foo:<*>*.*.*

DUMPER> restore ps:<*>*.*.*
	This gets the initial <SUBSYS> files

DUMPER> restore ps:<*>*.*.*
	This gets the GALAXY <SUBSYS> files

DUMPER> restore ps:<*>*.*.*
	This gets the <UETP.LIB> files

DUMPER> exit

$unload mta0:

$information disk-usage ps:<*>
	This will tell you how much disk space is taken up by each directory

	The next step is optional:  If you want to catch the memory image of
	the system in case of monitor crashes, you need to create a repository
	file called <SYSTEM>DUMP.EXE of the memory size on your system.  For
	example, if you have 4MW of memory, specify "4096" below.

$run <subsys>makdmp.exe
MAKDMP> create ps:<system>dump.exe 4096
MAKDMP> exit

Once you've gotten this far, we can explore the next things you need to do to
set up a Tops-20 system.  And maybe in the mean time someone will find a KS-10
Installation Guide.  It won't be me, since I've never worked with the little
guys (except as a tourist at MIT).
