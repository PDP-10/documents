After I found Ed Taft's PDP-10 I/O package he wrote at Harvard, I started
rewriting some of my BLISS code in MACRO-10.  With I/O hassles solved, fast
compile times, and a wonder macro language, why use BLISS?

You wrote Tulip? In that case, here's a fan letter. I used stuff in Tulip
regularly for several years, it was a great library.

The documentation was great, especially the section that explained the
coroutine support in Tulip. One of the more hilarious documents I've
ever read.

I wrote just the documentation!  Well, I think I added four
instructions to the parser.  Ed didn't write any documentation, so I
figured I should, if only to repay him for the time it saved me.

>The documentation was great, especially the section that explained the

Also one of the first pieces of prose I _wanted_ to write, or at least
to write well.  One thing I learned from it was a) boy, do a lot of
typos slip in, and b) after fixing everything I could find I was now a
great proofreader.  The latter can be more hindrance than help -
beyond a certain % of misspellings in a USENET post, I hit the n key,
no matter how interesting the post appeared.  I can spot typos in
things I'm not reading.  When I started typing this I noticed I had
written "wonder macro language".  A few months ago I was reading one
of Bob Metcalfe's columns in the back of Infoworld about networking in
schools.  I was the first to point out to him that he had written
"pubic education".  I don't remember anything else about the column,
it may not have been on networking, but the school system itself.

Yeah, I had fun writing it.  Let's see, I had a couple challenges in it.
One was what was the item in the index that conveyed no useful information.
That was the start of the index.  There was also something about that
coroutine code.  I think the second coroutine did a jump to the JSP
in the first to save an instruction.  (You really have to see that on
paper for it to make any sense.)

I do have the documentation and sample programs.  I will get them on
the WWW, but not for a while.

I do have a new page on the WWW you might enjoy -

It seems to me that most of the 36-bit folks were not fans of
BLISS. There are two main reasons for using a higher-level language.

o Programmer productivity: by using a language that maps better to
  a programmer's thought processes or the problem at hand, we can
  get the same work done in less time. Or more work in the same time,
  etc.

o Portability: by avoiding machine language, we have some hope of
  separating the code from the hardware details of a single machine.

In which ways did BLISS fail in these promises? I can think of several
possibilities.

o By failing to improve on the expressiveness of machine code, it
  didn't really improve productivity. I've never used BLISS and don't
  know much about it; could the experts comment on this?

o By including too much of the peculiar details of a particular
  machine architecture (word length, or byte addressability), it
  failed to be portable. As, say, Multics would be a pain to port
  because of all the explicit PL/1 declarations of 36-bit integers.

o By failing to be reliable, it negated any benefits that might
  otherwise accrue.

o By generating code so inefficient that it wasn't practical to use.

o Maybe the 36-bit machines were just so different that it wasn't
  practical to port code (especially system code) between them and the
  16/32-bit byte-oriented architectures.

Anyway, it seems that C succeeded in a big way where BLISS failed. I
can think of a couple of reasons for that, like the proprietary
single-vendor nature of BLISS, and that it has largely succeeded on
16/32/64-bit byte oriented machines that probably ease the porting
load.

Any comments from those who know a lot more than I?

The problem with BLISS on the PDP-10 was that it was much easier to write
an application in PDP-10 assembly language than BLISS.  The only PDP-10
operating system which had system calls that were remotely ameniable for
high-level languages was ITS (the .CALL UUO).  In all other operating
systems, setting up a system call required that you knew the precise
accumulator and memory values; this was trivial in assembly language but a
nightmare in a high level language.

C succeeded where BLISS failed for many reasons.  C's syntax is much more
reasonable, and it certainly much easier to write applications in C than
in assembly language on these gruesome hardware architectures being built
today.

I spent 15 years programming PDP-10 assembly language, and a subsequent 11
years programming in C.  I would not think of writing in assembly language
on an Alpha, Pentium, etc.  On the other hand, to this day, I can still
write a PDP-10 program better in assembly language than in C.

Could you elaborate on that? If anything, library written in assembler
usually isolates such stuff pretty well. Not all Unices implement system
calls as calls to invalid addresses - normally it's "set registers and cause
a particular trap". Mixing pathes used for syscalls and paging is not
too bright idea... C doesn't know about PDP-11 "trap" or x86 "int $0x80"
either...

ObBLISSsyntax: what kind of pervert came up with idea of _ and . usage
in BLISS? In C usage of . is more bearable, but using it in place of
unary *... Mind-boggling. Especially nice on dirty printouts...

Well of course, until they changed the standard, _ printed out as <-
(but one character). The idea of . was for consistancy. In most programming
languges, a variable name means either its address or its value depending
on placement. For example, in fortran

    i = i + 1

the i has different meanings. Typically this is expressed as the lvalue (the
address on the left hand side of the =) and the rvalue (the value, on the
right). In Bliss, everything is an lvalue, to get the rvalue, preceed with .

Thus, in Bliss

    i = i + 1

is completely valid, it just doesn't do what you might expect. (It adds one
to the address in memory where i is stored and stores the result in the
memory location pointed to by i). To get "normal" behaviour write

    i = .i + 1

I much prefer this approach to that used by c, but it's a personal thing!
I find things like

    .i = .j

fun to right and easy to understand....

Sorry, but... It's a different question. FWIW I prefer C way - IMHO it's a nice
balance between bare-bones BLISS rules and convoluted mess of A-68, but
that's a personal thing. I was actually asking about a different thing -
choice of operation symbol. I know what '.' means in BLISS and I know the
ideology behind it (no implicit rules, no l- and r-values), but dot is the
worst character for such usage - way too easy to miss it in dirty printout.
***q=**p; is not the easiest thing to read, but ....Q_...P is much nastier.
And as any child of BCPL BLISS is weak-typed, so...

Having ported Ingres (the version that came with BSD 4.1 [?], not the
commercial version) to TOPS-10, the one thing that really bit me was that
there was no good choice for representing (char *) on the 10.  The compiler
I was using stored them as a byte count from 0, which made pointer arithmetic
easy but made dereferencing a pointer, or casting it to a non char pointer,
expensive.  Storing them as byte pointers would have done the opposite.

Of course this was aggravated by the tendency of the original Ingres crew to
declare _all_ pointers as char *.

This is verbatim from HAKMEM, and unless I miss the point of this post, it's
not that hard...
It's one of those little tricks that comes from indexed address arithmetic.

ITEM 165 (Freiberg):
A byte pointer can be converted to a character address < 2^18 by MULI A,<#
bytes/word> followed by SUBI B,1-<# b/w>(A). To get full word character
address, use SUB into a magic table.

That's for sure.


    o By generating code so inefficient that it wasn't practical to use.

I dunno.  Other horrendously bad code generators were/are successful.  This
isn't nearly as bad as the reliability issue above.  For the most part, code
efficiency is only interesting "near the edge", where most programs AREN'T.
If a language catches on, the code generation gets better.

Could be.  More like "the target audience for BLISS already was proficient
in assembly language, and therefore recoiled in horror."  You get people to
write in high level languages because its HARD to write assembler (for one
reason or another.)  Macro wasn't HARD, especially for the would-be converts
to bliss.

    can think of a couple of reasons for that, like the proprietary

It's worth noticing that C didn't "succeed in a big way" until well AFTER
the PDP10s were thrashing around in their death throes.  As late as 1984,
MAC-OS was released, programmed mainly in Pascal (?)  Plenty of other high
level languages have failed (APL, Modula2, Pascal (for all practical
purposes, I think), OCCAM, etc, etc) I suppose the real question is "why did
languages like fortran, cobol, and C *succeed*", rather than "why did BLISS
fail."

That could be it.  I suspect that it was simply too powerful for the

Like the three-branch IF in FORTRAN?  Or car/cdr in Lisp?  Both are
straight out of the IBM 70x architecture.

BTW take a look at Bliss-11 (used quite a bit on the CMMP), or Common
Bliss (which was supposed to enable portability between 16-, 32-, and
36-bit architectures, only one of which has the funky byte pointers in
hardware).  Bliss was only tied to the PDP-10 if you chose to think of
it that way.

Do you mean that the compiler was unreliable, or that the language
made programmers unreliable?  I don't recall either one being
especially true of Bliss.

> o By generating code so inefficient that it wasn't practical to use.

On the contrary.  I thought I was a pretty good PDP-10 assembly
programmer until I started studying assembly listings from BLIS10 and
saw some of the things *it* did.

Again, FORTRAN grew up on 36-bit machines (from IBM) and made the
transition without serious problems.

The biggest problem I recall is that the learning curve was nearly a
step function.  You didn't have to learn so many things, but they were
hard lessons, at least for me, and you had to learn them *all* before
you could do much.  And, as somebody else has said, assembly on the
PDP-10 was simply too easy for most people to bother with "system
programming" HLLs.  On TOPS-20 I wrote a mail user-agent that was
pretty much a clone of the non-network portions of DECmail-MS,
entirely in MACRO, and looking back I don't see how it would have been
significantly easier in any other language we had then.

It is clear from your post that you didn't use it.

Expressiveness of the language is not important, or we'd
all be writing in APL.

First, you should at least know that there were two
separate Bliss compilers in 36-bit land. Bliss-10 and Bliss-36.
Bliss-10 was the first language, and was oritented strongly towards
TOPS-10 (and later Tops-20. Bliss-36 was supposed to be
part of the Common Bliss family that was capable of working
accross LCG, Vaxen, and PDP-11 families.

Sometimes I wonder if I was the only person who started a 
project in Bliss-36 and was happy.

Bliss-10/36  could "express" any machine construct, it could
simply emit machine codes if you couldn't figure out what
would cause it to generate what you wanted. While it was a bit
baroque, I don't think it was worse than the mess that Tops-20
Exec bacame with all the pseudo-HLL constructs/macros
that folks did to "improve" the codng styles.

>o By including too much of the peculiar details of a particular
>  machine architecture (word length, or byte addressability), it
>  failed to be portable

Two problems here:
1) there wasn't much interest in portability back then. KLs were
a damn sight more interesting and capable than Vaxen or, shudder,
PDP-11s. We wrote truely portable code, but it cost a bunch and
we never made back the investment.

2) writing portable code is really expensive. Writing applications
portably is expensive.  Writing system-level utilities and 
languages accross architectures is seriously hard.
It has only become practical recently, when improvements in
speeds and memory sizes make "wasteful" techniques such
as virtual machines affordable.

While interpreted languages are not new (Smalltalk-80 gives a hint
of its age in its name), they were not successful until fairly
recently. I don't want to step into a holy war, but I don't
consider most C code to be portable. Java and Smalltalk
allow fairly portable code to be written, but they have
limits and were not feasible back when KLs were feasible.

>o By failing to be reliable, it negated any benefits that might
>  otherwise accrue.

Reliable? Huh? Do you have examples to back up this assertion?
I found Bliss to be highly reliable. We wrote a DBMS package in
Bliss-36 that ran unmodified for more than 15 years. And it used
what were at the time, techniques that were on the forefront
of the art, such as user mode extended addressing, OWGBP, etc.

>o By generating code so inefficient that it wasn't practical to use.

The Bliss-36 code generator was decent, and the peephole 
optimizer was fine. Sure you could beat it with hand tweaked
code, but it generated faster and more compact code than
a beginning Macro-10/20 programmer. I had many examples
of this from my staff.

We did it. The economics didn't work, but that isn't a fault if the
language or the concept of High Level Languages. Problems
that were solvable by PDP-11s in 1979 were not addressed
by folks with the resources to own a KL or two.

There are as many beliefs behind the success of C over Bliss as
programmers.

I subscribe to the theory that C succeeded because it was a small
language that worked well on small machines such as the original IBM
PC. Hackers couldn't afford KLs or even Vaxen, but they could
afford an IBM PC or clone. They needed a language. C fit and
was available. So a market appeared and grew.

Bliss wouldn't have fit in an original PC, even the BLiss-16 compilers
of the early 80s expected you to have a Vaxen or KL to cross compile
on.

Bliss was invented to solve similar problems as C, in the same
timeframe. They are  closely parallel languages, altho I much
prefer some of Bliss' constructs over C's. But like in other
areas of technology, the superior product does not always
succeed. I think of Bliss as the Beta of late 70s programming.
Better than the competion that beat it in the marketplace.
But still a loser because it lost.

All just IMHO, of course.

Probably :-) none of my guys were happy.  What kind of project was it?
I more curious about the level of the software, i.e., OS
level, user mode level, application level, etc. rather than
the specs of the project.

One of the problems of any flavor of the blisses on the -10
is that a build almost required a stand-alone -10 that
didn't crash for 12 hours (that was not our environment).
It was so much faster to build stuff written in MACRO-10
than BLISS-xx.  So a developer who wrote in assembly
would rarely have to wait a day for a build turn-around
time.  Building anything, and I mean ANYTHING, with BLISS
meant that the IBM card turnaround time mentality became
the norm.  That wasn't our style.

We actually did two.

First, we wrote a DBMS package.
Specifically because System 1022 had a hard stop limit of 18-bits of
records per database. We needed more than that, and we ended up
writing our own. Ended up with 700,000 records filling an RP07.
Wow, that was huge back then.

The second was a client/server application that used DEC-Pro350
(PDP-11) "personal computers" as intellegent programmable terminals
for our KLs. We also had a version that used a Vaxen or multi-user
PDP-11 as an intellegent concentrator for Vt100s. This was 
before "decnet phase 3" made interoperability and/or 
internetworking between DEC product lines feasible :-)

>I more curious about the level of the software, i.e., OS

Gee, That was along time ago, so the specifics are fuzzy.
We were a Tops-20 source site, running the "current" monitors.
We jumped on whatever Tops-20 first had user mode extended
addressing. The hardware were six KL, all of which
ended up as B models, usually 2060s or 2065s.

The code was used as tools for applications, most of which
were written in Cobol with System 1022 as the datastore.

I'm not sure what else you're currious about. Let me know,
and if I remember...

Funny, We didn't see this problem. Of course, we weren't building
a monitor. But we constantly used the usual edit/compile/debug cycle,
and it was effective for Bliss-36. 

For the crossported stuff, where we had to run Bliss-16 on the KL,
the download and TKB crud from PDP-11 land added tons of time
to the cycle. But I think the inept PDP-11 debugging tools cost
as much as the compilers themselves.

I'm not claiming Bliss-36 was as fast as Macro-20, but it was not
a problem for us.

We didn't run our KLs are grossly overloaded as education sites.
We had users paying for the machines, and they complained about
performance when we had 50 or so users simultaneously.

    My gracious!  I pop in here after a long absense and find... a
    compiler religious war!  Some things never change...
    
    I was one of the violent opponents of Bliss in the late '70s when
    it was moving into DEC and was finally declared to be the
    "official" implementation language by Gordon Bell.  It's not that
    I opposed using an HLL (where the 'H' here is debatable), but I
    really thought Bliss didn't make the grade.  It really was little
    more than a glorified assembler and did little that I couldn't do
    in MACRO-10 macros.

    Bliss was available and basically free, and DEC was too cheap and
    short-sighted to think beyond that.

    And yes, I subsequently used Bliss a lot.  Thank GoD!  Otherwise,
    in those circumstances, I'd have had to program in VAX Macro (gag,
    wretch).  Ironically, PDP-10 assembler programming was so easy
    (compared to most), especially with macros to handle stack and
    structure stuff, that we were lulled into a false sense of not
    really needing a more "higher level" language.
    
    Bad mistake.

    If TOPS-20 had been written (or recoded) into an HLL, it could be
    where Unix is today.  It was a better OS in the days when both
    were new, but Unix won out for two reasons: ran on cheap machines
    compared to PDP-10's, and (2) portable in a practical sense --
    i.e. was ported to lots of other machines during critical
    junctures.  Shit.  If we'd even have recoded in Bliss, we might
    have had a chance.
    
    I knew the writing was on the wall when the ARPA community, which
    had earlier adopted TENEX/TOPS-20, declared in the late '70s that
    it was going to Unix, and that DEC could take VMS and shove it.

    C was good enough, and "the perfect is the enemy of the good".
    All the "much better" languages are dust.  Yes, C and Unix
    supported each other in an amazing example of symbiosis.  Each
    would likely have disappeared without the other.
    
    Saying C is not portable is ratshit.  That it is not perfectly
    portable is exactly why it succeeded.  Those who waited for the
    perfectly portable language are still waiting.

Commercial success or not, but there were at least 3 reimplementations of
UNIX kernel (Coherent, Minix and Linux). I've never seen the guts of Coherent,
but API was pretty close to v7. Minix guts are very different, but API is
again v7-ish. Linux... well, we are very close to 4.4BSD, both guts and API.
Were there any attempts to write a TOPS-20 look-alike? XKL uses modified
TOPS-20 sources. Were there any independent projects? 4BSD is not exactly
what I mean - AFAIK many *very* nice ideas came from TOPS-20/TENEX, but...

Is there *any* text that would describe the TOPS-20 internals on the level
of Daemon Book? Printed, on-line - something? 

ObInternals: could somebody give a description of the file locking in TOPS-20
(information other systems are also welcome, indeed). I mean *technical*
description - for $DEITY sake, to hell with advocacy. Maybe the best way would
be to reply by email - I'll summarize and post to the group. (Reason: current
cleanup of our file locking. And yes, I'm aware that it sucks. Those who came
up with POSIX locks semantics should be forced to suck several putrefied
whales through the straw. Daily. I'm sure that they will manage).

I asked Valdeane Alusic about this this morning; she said "No."  She did say,
after further reflection, that people might have thought so because that group
was the first in DEC to use "structured programming" for a project.

BLISS-10 sources were definitely available to the field, although it probably
was only supported for building supported products written in BLISS-10.  I
can't remember if the BLISS-10 sources initially shipped just with FORTRAN-10
or what.
				/AHM
P. S.  Speaking of BLISS sources, BLISS-11 is online at
ftp://iecc.com/pub/file/bliss.tar.gz .  Its optimizer is better than
BLISS-10's - rather closer to Common BLISS's quality.

Alan, think.  One didn't need BLISS-10 sources in order to build
products written in BLISS-10.

FORTRAN-10

The _Bliss_ sources weren't shipped on the tape; just the *.EXEs
and (I can't remember this) I suspect LIBs, etc.  The Fortran
tape was a mess since it also insisted on shipping RELs, UNVs and
EXEs that belonged on the CUSP tape.  One of my knockdowns with
Sara was to get that stuff off all the language tapes so that
there would no longer be any version skews of supported products.
It took the monitor group about 5 years to solve that problem
along with eliminating 22 CUSP update tapes.

The %1% case arm used @, because it was known if one wanted to indirect one
more time, the fetched value was just an 18-bit address.  So, it wouldn't work
to treat it as a byte pointer with a general-case LDB, and it didn't contain
indexing or indirection, so there was no point chewing on it with a full-blown
effective address calculation.

Both case arms used \, because the table was known to contain indirect words
which indexed off of some register named R2, and so you needed the generated
code to indirect through the table entry.


I didn't write the code - I just had the honor of pre-reviewing it before the
project meeting.  (The author didn't want to have to pull me out of the
ceiling by the ankles if it had been sprung on me unawares).  The code was
necessary and sufficient; we shipped it; it works.

It was trivial in BLISS-36 to define custom linkages for Tops-20 JSY which put
input and output parameters into the proper registers.  For instance, DFOUT
took AC1-AC4 as inputs, left stuff in AC1 and AC4, and had a single skip
return on success.

LINKAGE
	J_1234_14_1 = JSYS(1, 2, 3, 4; 1, 4) : SKIP(1);
BIND ROUTINE
	DFOUT = %O'235' : J_1234_14;

So, a DFOUT of the contents of variables A, B, C and D, which put the output
parameters into variables Y and Z, and which evaluated true if the call
skipped, would be written:

	IF NOT DFOUT(.A, .B, .C, .D; Y, Z)
	THEN error


On TOPS-10, you constructed the arg block in memory, stuck its address into
the AC of your choice, and executed the CALLI of your choice with a MACHOP or
MACHSKIP builtin.

With BLISS-10, you declared the CALLI opcode as a MACHOP and called them as
functions (perhaps in an IFSKIP statement).


Here's some BLISS-36 to print the lowseg and hiseg filespec of a TOPS-10 job. 
Comments might help, but I can still reverse engineer all the fields of those
system calls from the code.  A tighter coding style, a subroutine for pulling
a job or hiseg's path, and a printf would have come in handy, too.  (It would

Common BLISS could be written very portably between 10's, 11's, VAXen and
Alphas, but engineering almost never paid the extra investment it required -
extra rules to follow every step of the way.  Those decisions are still
bearing fruit.

Two examples of portability shortcuts: VAX DEBUG was written with only
half-hearted use of the character-handling functions which abstracted away
PDP-10 byte pointers from 11/VAX byte addressing.  So, a port to the -10 would
have required looking at every line of code to see where CH$ builtins had to
be added.  And I suspect that a lot of BLISS-32 code *knew* that a fullword
was 32 bits, which must have been just lovely to port to Alpha.

There was no silver bullet to learning BLISS.  The Fortran-10 group once hired
3 or 4 people in a row who learned BLISS-10 in college, but that was an
aberration.  A vanishingly small user community outside the company guaranteed
that you had to train almost everyone (sometimes without even in-house course
materials), and wait the months for them to come fully up to speed.  That kept
costs too high once C really became the rage.

A lot of BLISS programmers have been just as opposed to C as any BLISS
opposition by MACRO programmers we see here.  Widespread C use inside Digital
seems to postdate the advent of X/DECwindows.  I don't know how much change
was caused by it, but many products did have to write or rewrite GUIs. 
Maintaining and using in-house BLISS bindings that shadowed the various X APIs
didn't really catch on.  So, a critical mass of people got dipped in C sooner
or later (and more and more people came in the door already knowing C).

BLISS-10's code quality was nothing to write home about.  BLISS-36's was
pretty good, especially for the time.  (I suspect it was tighter than the
MACRO code in the average random cusp).

As far as reserving special registers goes, BLISS-10 had some features for it,
and BLISS-36 was very good at it.  BLISS-10 would let you state where the
stack pointer, etc. lived, and let you reserve some registers to be declared
as variables.  BLISS-36 would let you declare that specific routines of yours
passed certain arguments in certain registers.  Furthermore I recall that if
you told it (as I posted elsewhere today), "this JSYS takes ACs 1, and 2 as
input, and leaves something in AC1 as a result", and said your own routine
took a byte pointer in AC1, then code like this:

ROUTINE MY_ROUTINE(BUFFER_BP) : MY_ROUTINE_LINKAGE=
BEGIN
	...
	THE_JSYS(.BUFFER_BP, .THIS_STRING; BUFFER_BP);
	THE_JSYS(.BUFFER_BP, .THAT_STRING; BUFFER_BP);
	...
END;

would allocate the buffer byte pointer to AC1 and leave it there for all the
calls, which were moving it along as they wrote to the in-core buffer.

0.  I entered a couple of dozen DCE edits to Fortran-10 from the Software
Dispatch while I was in the field.

1.  BLISS-10 sources were definitely available to the field.

2.  BLISS-10 was probably only supported to build supported products written
in BLISS-10.  (Just like PA1050 would only accept bugs encountered while
running supported compatibility mode cusps).  However by 1981, BLISS-10 bugs
would probably have been dumped in the Fortran group's lap, and we would have
just issued a permanent restriction w/workaround.  It was a non-goal to touch
a hair on BLISS-10's head.

I once met the last BLISS-10 maintainer, but I can't remember his name...

Quite plausible.  I don't remember how the BLISS-10 sources were available to
the field.

Between 1977 and 1986, I can recall seeing evidence of 3 bugs in BLISS-10. 
(It had plenty of bug fixes, but these were all the ones I saw evidence of). 
The evidence was one piece of graffiti, a revelation found by reading
BLISS-10's sources, and an actual bug encountered while coding:

1.  This comment in FORTRAN-10:

"
%(****FEB 23,1972 - THE FOLLOWING BLOCK WAS INSERTED TO
	PREVENT A BLISS BUG THAT DELETED CODE . THIS BLOCK FORCES
	BLISS TO USE 2 TEMP REGS***)%
BEGIN
	OWN T,T1,T2,T3;
	T = 1; T1 = 2; T2 = 3; T3 = 4;
END;
"

We never saw another example of it, and for all we know the bug was fixed.


2.  One of the two typos in FORTRAN-10's PEEPOP.BLI was dutifully copied into
BLISS-10's H3PEEP.BLI (a comparison of an instruction's Y field symbol table
pointer, instead of the Y field's value, to another instruction's register
number).  It would erroneously go ahead and change this:

	MOVEM	R1,R2
	OP	R2,ANY
	MOVE	R1,R2
to this:
	MOVEM	R1,R2
	OP	R2,ANY

even though R2 had been changed by OP, and so R1 did really need to be
reloaded. 
I never heard of anyone encountering the bug; we didn't try and fix it.  (The
other bug, a missing dot, was silently fixed in BLISS-10 without being
reported back to FORTRAN-10, until I spotted it while reading code).


3.  This would make BLISS-10 punt:

MACRO
	OUTASZ(STR)=OUTSTR(PASZ STR)$;

	OUTASZ('~');

The value for tilde was used as an escape by BLISS's macro processor, and it
couldn't tolerate it as a macro actual.  The one place we wanted to pass a
tilde to a macro (the place in FINE's help screen for M-~), we just expanded
the macro in-place.

Of course, I saw many dozens of people use BASIC-10 for 3 1/2 years in high
school, and never once saw BASIC screw anyone there.  So by that metric, BLISS
was incredibly unreliable.


BLISS-36?  I should have been so lucky as to have had a job using it.

"the horror...the horror..."  [Brando]

Ah, Bliss-10.  In late '75 I inherited MCS-10 (Message Control System
- DEC's answer to transaction processing at the time).  The majority
of the messaging logic was written in Bliss-10, about a 4 inch thick
listing on old 132 column fan fold printer paper.

After I finally got it to work (and ship!), with JMF's help of course,
a new version of Bliss-10 came out and when I compiled MCS with it, MCS
completely stopped working.  Some construct I was using stopped generating
the proper code.  Rather than re-qualify and test that much Bliss code, I
simply started shipping the older Bliss .EXE on the MCS tape.  Ruffled a
few feathers but it was the only way I was ever going to get off the MCS
project, I didn't want that to become my life's work.

That was my only encounter with Bliss, ever.  Scarred me for life.  I stuck
with assembly (-10, -11, VAX) until the mid 80's when I had to learn Pascal
(don't ask)

DCE was not only a Fortran-10 maintainer, but probably had to sign off on all
of *your* bug fixes.

I know who Eric is; I met him on or before 4-Jun-81.  This was a younger guy,
probably with a less conservative haircut.  I think he was visiting the office
area.

Well, your article was the first I saw in reply to mine, so at the
point I posted that, there were no "stories" to follow. A more
extensive discussion has, in fact, ensued. Possibly before your
message quoted above, given the asychronous nature of USENET.

> Hidden in them

Well I get the impression that you just don't trust any
compiler. Certainly developing a system using tools (including
compilers) that themselves are under development is a real problem; I
get the impression that this is what happened with BLISS on the 36-bit
machines, as the compiler either would generate bad code, forcing
workarounds, or would suddenly change its code generation, breaking
existing code. It's not, I think, a fundamental flaw in the concept of
using higher-level languages. I suspect that this factor had a lot to
do with the relative ease of developing Unix compared to Multics:
since C is such a simpler language than PL/1, a functional, reliable
compiler was much easier to develop.

I also get the impression that moving from an assembly-oriented
environment is a real problem, as cultural assumptions have already
worked their way deep into the system design. Arbitrary calling
conventions are hard to accomodate in a higher level language, for
instance, and this apparently made BLISS something of an outsider in
TOPS-10.

Building 350K lines of the FORTRAN compiler took an order of magnitude
less time than that on KL2137 (let alone MRFORT).  A single module
rebuild meant typing in the compile and link lines; no script - just a
.CCL file for the modules on the link line.

One might get that impression from reading some of this string.

BLISS-10's code quality was nothing to write home about - better than
ALGOL-10 worse than FORTRAN-10 and perhaps KCC-10; perhaps on a par with
F40.  (Note the irony: without BLISS-10 to implement FORTRAN-10, I
wonder whether there would ever have been an optimizing replacement for
F40.  Without an optimizing FORTRAN, there would have been a lot less
demand for KL's).

I think BLISS-36 would surprise us on occasion.  (I can remember it
recognizing a common subexpression over such a great distance that we
hadn't even realized there were two uses of the same expression).

Well, I don't know how we got BLISS-10 sources but at least one
customer had 'em, because I crudely hacked in something we needed
w.r.t. JSYS when we moved from TOPS-10 to TOPS-20.

I was commenting on the edit history that was posted.
I originally stated that I didn't know if there was 
a tape available for customers to get it by "honest"
means.  A lot of stuff was carried into customer sites
and left there under the table, depending on the customer's
needs.  I do know that Magee never built a BLISS tape (she
would have been complaining to me for hundreds of hours).
So that means that a tape wasn't submitted to SDC from
1976 or 1977 on.  I also do know that, even though a 
release of Bliss-10 was highly desirable (this was in 1982),
the logistics of doing a release ala the Project Notebook
was impossible.

One of the things that I started, was a formal review of
the SDC paperwork with each monitor release.  A part of that
review involved going over all of the SPDs to assess the
impact and, more importantly, the deimpact of anything
that would affect the tape submission.  I don't recall
seeing a Bliss SPD.

DEC invested money in replacing F40 with FORTRAN-10/20 because the
customers said it was necessary (just like those TU7x's).  The last I
heard, FORTRAN-10/20 had the highest PDP-10 market penetration of any
DEC layered product.

A product like FORTRAN-10/20 couldn't have been developed for nearly the
same cost in people, time and money without some implementation language
like BLISS-10.  What BLISS substitutes were already available on the -10
in the early 70's?

But you've got your years so screwed up.  That project started when
the KI was getting announced.

DEC hadn't developed a compiler that could be used for compiler
implementations.  So they did the usual thing that was done back
then and acquired work done at CMU ala G. Bell.  Norma Abel
(I think) could talk about why they picked that approach to 
the implementation lanaguage.  Sara was there, too, but I don't 
know if she was in that part of the planning stages.  I was a
mere Tape Prep type then, so I usually got the info at the
other end of the development cycle.  I do remember that the
work was getting done on 3-5.

And we're definitely talking about very different projects.
F40 was FortranII.  Fortran-10/20 was Fortran IV.  I don't
remmeber when the optimizer was done nor who did it.  I got
a feeling it was that guy :-) but I can't remember his name.
Somebody who disappeared fairly quickly?

The Fortran IV project had problems getting it tested.  So
they offered a reward for every bug found.  I won $1.00.  And
that was before and after the time DEC bought the RCA building
and moved to Marlboro.  I don't remember the optimiser being
a part of that test bed.

It's not as if some substitute language bloomed and died before
BLISS-10.

And how many million-dollar systems do you think would have been bought
with nothing more than a non-optimizing FORTRAN-II?

A big part of the -10 market needed a product (F10) whose timely
delivery depended upon BLISS-10.

Frank did most of the parser; Norma did (at least) most of the global
optimizer; Sara did (at least) most of the local optimizer and code
generation.

I think, in the KL era you mentioned, most of them.  And stop
talking about F-II.  That was gone by KI days.

That's right; Frank.  Somedays I wish I was gifted with the

Which was pre-1975.  But, if you wrote the memo, it was earlier than
that.  Wasn't it?  I don't remember seeing you when the move to

At least when I worked with it, the sematics of the F40 language was
almost identical to the F10 language, at least when we were
implementing Stewart's XRAY76 programs on the 10.  F40 implemented
subroutines via JSR's (I think), but whatever it did, it left the
return address in the first address of the subroutine, which was
actually the "classical" Fortran (II or IV) manner.  F10 implemented
subroutine calls via PUSHJs and POPJs (but I do not think it was
recursive).  I also remember the compiler generating optimizer
errors - the same type which plauge compilers today.  So we turned
the optimizer off.  Or tested the results VERY thuroughly.

But F40 was indeed Fortran IV, and not Fortran II.  Fortran II had a
quite different look to the PRINT statement (I think leaving out the
device number).  And it had the full range of conditionals, and more
complete than the IBM 1130 FORTRAN I started out with (only
arithmetic IFs), and that was called FORTRAN IV.

I'd like to see those VMSINSTAL freeware savesets of BLISS-32/64

BLISS-10 is in:

http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/pdp-10/BB-D868B-BM_TOPS20_V3A_2020_DIST.html

BLISS-11 is in:

http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/www/lib10/0325/index.html


Here is a cheat sheet called MODULE.TXT I wrote up in the early 80's by

Compare that to the description of BLISS-11 in Wulf, Johnson, Weinstock,
Hobbs, and Geschke's _The Design of an Optimizing Compiler_:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0444001581
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0444001646

Some stuff is similar; compare the routine EXPRESSION in:

http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/pdp-10/BB-D868B-BM_TOPS20_V3A_2020_DIST/3A-SOURCES/SN1N.BLI
with:
http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/www/lib10/0325/SYNTAX.BLI

However, I believe that a lot of the stuff in BLISS-11 (syntax-directed
translation-based(?) optimizations) just doesn't exist in BLISS-10.

I think BLISS-11 should be a much better hint at Common BLISS's
internals.  Another reference would be _The GEM Optimizing Compiler
System_, http://www.digital.com/DTJ808/DTJ808SC.TXT

As others have pointed out, on the VMS freeware CD which is
also available on the net, sorry I don't have the URL handy.

The sequence is BLISS-10, BLISS-11 which ran on TOPS-10/20 and
has been in the DECUS library for a while (get the book by Wulf,
good quick read,) Common BLISS which is much more like BLISS-11
than BLISS-10.  Among other things, the BLISS-10 macro (preprocessor)
facility was primitive next to BLISS-11 and Common BLISS.  I wonder
if BLISS-36 conditioned code is still in the sources.

Even before it was included on the DEC distributions, you could
get BLISS-10 from CMU if you knew the right people.  That is where
the copy I first used at Rapidata came from.  BLISS-36 was another
matter, it was like pulling teeth.  Same with RMS-10 even after it
was being used by COBOL.

When is one of the multitude of -10 emulators going to be released
so we can use this stuff instead of just talking about it?

We had a hell of a time, convincing management to ship
even the EXE.

Barb:

Hmmm.  I looked into CUSP/DIST tapes for TOPS-10 and TOPS-20.
For TOPS-10 v7.03/v7.04, I did not see any BLISS compiler in them but
just *.REQ, etc..  RMS-10 package comes with sources in written by
BLISS language. 

When I debugged ACTDAE... Yes, my debug log file showed weird code
looks like very different comparsion with code written by hands.
It was generated by a BLISS compiler.  It used stack area as local
variables.

For TOPS-20 v4.1, I found BLISS compiler but it is for TOPS-20 only.

Ok, thank you again for info.

I don't see a BLISS-10 on any of the online TOPS-10 cusp tapes:
http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/pdp-10/CUSPMAR86BINSRC_1OF2_BB-X128B-SB.html

	-or-
http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/pdp-10/CUST_SUP_CUSP_BB-X130C-SB.html

I wonder if at least the binary was on the Fortran layered product tape,
perhaps among other places.


>... (there were a number of GETSEGs).

Nope.  I've seen BLISS-36 run with multiple hisegs (named BLSSG1 through
BLSSG4, I think); perhaps only on TOPS-10, since
http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/pdp-10/BB-J939F-BM.HTML
only builds a single-hiseg BLISS-36.

However, BLISS-10 does not have multiple hisegs.


> Neither of these BLISSes were shipped with sources ...

The place Timothy Stark subsequently found BLISS-10 (``TOPS-20 V3A 2020
DISTRIBUTION TAPE 9 TRACK 1600 BPI MAGTAPE DRIVE# 273 S/N 2 SYS,
BB-D868B-BM''
http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/pdp-10/BB-D868B-BM_TOPS20_V3A_2020_DIST.html )

was the latest version, V7E(227), and it contains all the sources.

I still don't recall how TOPS-10 sites got BLISS-10 sources, but we
certainly had them in the field.

Any site that got BLISS-10 sources got them under the table.
What BLISS did we use to build SYSERR (I think that was the

I should also point out that, just because there existed a
tape in SDC, does not mean that the tape was available for
customer purchase.  I never reviewed an SPD for BLISS-10.
It was not a product made available for customers.  

Eric did make a source tape of BLISS-10 after cleaning 
up a Big Mess.  I advised him to make that source tape
and have Magee submit it to SDC.  That was our way

changed their business plan.)  But there wasn't any
way for a customer to order that tape since we did NOT
make an SPD for it.

I wish people had been taught how we did our business.  It
wasn't just writing programs and automagically the customers
got it.

I think at least a couple versions are in the PDP-10 Archives already,
although I cannot promise that they are complete.  In particular,

Careful.  What got shipped on the -20 tapes may not be the
code that built the stuff on the -10.  Double check that
the edit level.  The edit level is very important and 
had a strict standard of assignation within LCG (Large
Computer Group)....at least, it did while some old farts
were still around.

For quite some time, it was very common to hear someone wandering the
halls of MR1 say "Bliss is ignorance!"  

I tried to use it for some system software, but the code it generated
was about 3 times the size of well written Macro-10, and it took me
longer to figure out all the compiler bugs and work around them.

The assembly language optimizer in Bliss only worked on a very small
window of instructions, and while it may have been great for the VAX,
it did nothing for RISC style machines.  For the -10, it really
sucked.

And that's why I blew up like I did.  It appears that we designed
our cold start procedure into a corner with no way out.  Tim's
problem is an example of depending on a HLL for all system 
software; it's a pure CATCH-22 problem with the only solution
has the assumption that a functional system exists before
a coldstart installation.

The current design has painted itself to ultimately rely
on BLISS-10 code generation working reproducibly well.

BLISS-10 could generally reproduce the same machine code
(I am assuming no changes).  BLISS-36 could not.

Maybe 10 instructions.  (Fortran-10 buffered 50).

BLISS-11, BLISS-32, BLISS-16, BLISS-64 *and* BLISS-36 have global
optimizers.  I've seen BLISS-36 notice that a complex boolean was still
sitting in a register pages of code away from where it had been computed.

BLISS-10 is far simpler - perhaps has little more than that peephole
optimizer.  BLISS-10 compares to its successors like the PDP-11 C
compiler compares to gcc.

It's worse than that.  The BLISS compilers before DECnet
are different than the BLISS compilers after DECnet.
That BLISS-11 that you guys are talking about is a before-DECnet
compiler. 

Comparing before-DECnet BLISSes with after-DECnet-BLISSes
is more like comparing FORTRAN II with FORTRAN IV.  

And it even gets more complicated than that because BLISS
development continued a CMU _without us getting any of the
updates_.  So BLISS-10 and BLISS-11 compiler development
is really some flavor of compiler that had been frozen
in the early 70s (I'm guessing) or so.

The person we need for all of this BLISS-10 and RMS stuff
is Eric Macgrath.  Somebody go kick him.

It's probably easier to translate C to BLISS than the reverse. 
Especially given that nothing in C can match the BLISS macro facility.

It's certainly the case that various people have looked at the
possibility of a BLISS to C translator but the killer is the macro
facility built into the BLISS compiler front-end.  I also know that
someone looked at the possibility of making the BLISS compiler
generate C source code rather than object files (the aim was to widen
the portability of programs written in BLISS) but this idea was
abandoned for a variety of reasons.

And m4 was used as one for the DECnis 
FDDI line card too IIRC.

So not *everything* was done in BLISS :-)

VAX and VMS were conceived around 1975.  I think it's stretching it a
bit to say that BCPL was "widely" available then.  I should say that I
learned how to write properly structured programs using BCPL.

Maybe so.  As I understand the situation, BLISS was favoured by DEC
because of the DEC-CMU connections and because of the research that
had been done at CMU on producing highly optimised code (the TOPS-10
hosted BLISS-16 compiler).  My view (which others will likely disagree
with) is that it was only around the mid-1970s timeframe that DEC
became seriously interested in compilers.  It had previously done
pretty much everything in assembly language of one sort or another and
compilers were just something that customers needed so had to be
provided.  Some compilers were bought in (BASIC-PLUS on RSTS for
example).  You have to remember that DEC was basically a hardware
company that used software (which was often given away) to leverage
hardware sales.  That model only really changed after the PDP-11
appeared and VAX was the first hardware designed along with software.

I remember that the computing service at Cambridge University produced
a guide to FORTRAN portability which showed what language features
were portable and to what degree.  Although the core of the language
was highly portable there were lots of features that IBM (especially
in the S/370 H compiler) and others added that were distinctly
non-portable.

CompaQ killed the BLISS/NT intel and Alpha compilers, but they existed for
quite some time.  OracleRdb/NT used them extensively.

Copies may exist, or maybe CompaQ got soft and put them in the public
domain.

I always thought that the exorbitant pricing of the BLISS compiler was
a mistake.  I think there was a lot of pressure internally to not sell
it (it being seen as a competitive advantage) so the high price was
probably intended as a deterrant.

We started with BLIS10 straight from CMU in mid 70s but
migrated to BLISS-36 once it was finally available.  I
still miss the macro facility.  And unlike C, it doesn't
pretend to be all things to all people.

DEC had the same policy with other things, such as making
the RMS API available outside FORTRAN and COBOL.  It would
have saved us time, money, and much pain.

BLISS-36 is a whole 'nuther story about how not to business.

One of the problems with BLISS-10 is that we (LCG) never
managed it well.  It was always in that limbo land of sorta
supported and not sorta supported and nobody in charge of that
language was willing to treat like a real product.  I don't know
how much having CMU fingers in the pie fucked it up.  If I ever
heard that CMU was "involved" in something, I nixed it or I gave
up on it.  I've always traced these problems directly back to 
Bell's <ahem>thinking.

I had some problems with the lanagage itself but they were minor.
But it was my first lesson in what happens when HLLs are used
as a language to deliver computing service.  The number of files 
one had to keep hanging around to do anything was horrible.
This back when disks weren't cheap and a max capacity of 80,000
blocks.
