That might be true, but the part numbers for the TOPS-20AN distribution
and media are still listed in the SPD (21.30.04) at gatekeeper.dec.com.
Sometimes, armed with the appropriate part number, you can convince
the folks at DECdirect to sell you something which all other branches
of the company insist doesn't exist.  Of course, just because you
have a part number doesn't mean it exists, either!  [There's a wonderful
story I was told about someone ordering a replacement caster for a
BA123 "world box"; a few months after the order was placed, it came
back, with a standard form saying "part number <whatever> not available
individually; order next higher subassembly: BA123"!!!]

If it helps any, here are the numbers listed in that SPD:
