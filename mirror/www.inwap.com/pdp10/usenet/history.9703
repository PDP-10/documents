The pdp-8 had a few assemblers: PAL III, MACRO-8, PAL-D, PAL8, SABR,
and PALTS-8 (the PAL-D version that ran under TSS/8).  According to
DEC's "programming languages" (volume 2 of the pdp-8 handbook series):

"PAL III (an acronym for Program Assembly Language, version III)"
"The PAL-D Disk Assembler ..."
"SABR (Symbolic Assembler for Binary Relocatable programs)"

"PAL8 is an advanced symbolic assembler for the PDP-8 series
 computers, designed to run under the PS/8 Operating System.
 It is an 8K, two pass assembler (with an optional third pass
 listing) which is generally compatible with PAL-III, MACRO-8,
 and PAL-D."

Would anyone be interested in seeing the FOCAL-8 chapter?
I took the liberty of typing it in, and have it in softcopy.

Also, does anyone have a spare copy of volume 1 of the pdp-8
handbook series, "Introduction to Programming"?  It covered
the pdp-8 machine architecture, instruction set and assembly
language, as I recall.  I borrowed the computer lab's copy
one weekend in 1978, and haven't seen one since.

DEC did most of their early software development for the -8 on
cross-assemblers, by the end of the 1960's, this was being done
using a the PDP-10; PAL-8 was essentially compatable with the
PDP-10 assembler being used -- once you expunged the PDP-10 symbols
from the symbol table and defined the appropriate PDP-8 stuff.

Of course, customers were doing plenty in versions of PAL or MACRO-8
(I have paper-tapes of both), and there was plenty of interchange
between the two worlds.  Once OS-8 was up and running, it became
an effective development environment for PDP-8 code, particularly
once TECO was ported to the -8.

I'm not sure what you mean, PAL-10 is how we slaves often wrote code
until we had OS/8 running and PAL-8. The assembler we used under TOPS-10
for the 10's was MACRO-10 if I remember correctly. We outputed paper
tape that went right on the '33's. Many of the best PAL tricks I learned
where from reading DEC's diags (also done in PAL-10).

I always did better before TECO as the CCL remembered my files between
PAL and the editor and when we patched TECO in it wasn't the same. 

I just realized that I have sitting a bootable RK05 with OS/8 on it
under a pile of books. Anybody want to pay shipping?

This is almost correct. When Roger Pyle and I were writing the PDP-8 Disk 
Monitor System (circa 1967), the only assembler available was the paper tape 
based PAL-III. We prepared our source on the PDP-6 using TECO and punched a 
source paper tape which we assembled on the -8. As part of the Disk Monitor 
System project I took the guts of PAL-III and turned it into PAL-D, the first 
disk based PDP-8 assembler. I then left that project to (along with Don 
Witcraft) write TSS/8. We quickly realized we needed an assembler with more 
symbol table space (and perhaps externals) and turned to Bob Bowering for 
help. Bob was the author of MACRO for the -6 and -10. Based upon specs 
provided by Don and me, Bob wrote PAL-X in a very short time. Note that Bob 
had just created MACRO-10, which was at that time was saved as MACROX.SAV (I 
think perhaps to distinguish it from PDP-6 MACRO), and commonly pronounced 
"MACK-rocks".

By the time OS-8 appeared, I was in the PDP-10 Monitor Group and of 
course denied any knowledge whatsoever of the PDP-8.

No. I don't think you did use MACRO-10 for PDP-8 development.  When you
guys (excuse me, people) submitted work to Tape Prep, we would type in the
code sheets (using the -10 because it was hard to get stand alone time
wrested from you developers on the -8s), then use the specified assembler
to do test assemblies, do the _appropriate_ linking, and punch tapes if
you wanted them.  There were also linkers (or actually, back then,
loaders) that were run on the -10 but were specific to target CPU-type. 
These produced *.SAV files which we could then even copy (in the case of
-11s) to DECtape in PDP-11 format using FILEX. I don't remember if there
was an equivalent for the PDP-8.  

Tape Prep was essentially established to be the programmer's "sectretary".
 Back then guys didn't type and taking typing lessons in school was a
"girl thing".

If there was a wall it was between the PDP-10 monitor group and everyone 
else. DEC's corporate culture at that time was pretty much a meritocracy, 
with the -10 folks (at least in the Programming Department) being top dogs. 
We were an arrogant lot and tended to look down our noses at people playing 
with "those little systems". Since the PDP-5/8, PDP-4/7/9/15, and later the 
PDP-11 never posed a threat to the -10's pre-eminent position in the DEC 
hierarchy, the level of animosity never reached that which later existed 
between the 36 and 32 bit worlds.

I've been doing a survey of DEC's advertising, and it's interesting to note
that most of the ads DEC ran between 1965 and 1970 were for the PDP-8; DEC
started vigorously advertising the -8 in May 1965, and they continued that
campaign through the 1960's.

Starting around 1970, though, DEC's advertising shifted focus, with much of
their high-visibility advertising in general circulation publications
(for example, in Scientific American) shifting to the PDP-10.  With this
shift came a change in advertising style:

PDP-8 ads always had photos of the machine, frequently with teddy bears,
roses or other "cuddly" props, and emphasized the personal connection
between user and computer.  PDP-10 ads, on the other hand, were more likely
to be print only, or print augmented with cartoon drawings -- after all,
most PDP-10 users never saw the machine -- they saw a teletype and modem,
and their use with the machine were through the medium of textual input and
output.

DEC made a big point about the PDP-10 being the dominant ARPAnet host, and
they pushed it as a deparemental supercomputer, able to handle the entire
computing load of an entire large university department.  The term
supercomputer had no generally accepted definition in the early 1970's,
and DEC used it quite heavily in their print advertising for the -10.

During the mid-60s DEC made it a point to portray themselves as "all cuddly 
and user friendly" computer company, I believe to seperate themselves from 
IBM and the seven dwarves. The corporate teddy bear was always prominently 
displayed in the DEC booth at trade shows. I wish I still had a copy of a 
memo from Ken Olsen complaining about the appearance of the bear at a show in 
1966 or '67. He made it very clear that in the future someone needed to take 
responsibility for making sure the bear's fur was brushed and his bow crisply 
pressed.

I remember a third-hand story...

ACM speakers sometimes were hosted at DEC buildings.  At one talk in Tewksbury
(home of Vax folks), someone from Maynard (home of the PDP-10/20 folks)
wore a shirt reading "Nuke Tewksbury".  This was a takeoff on all the 
"Nuke the baby gay whales" or "Nuke Jane Fonda" jokes of the time.  
This was all taken in fun by those attending.

Well, all but one. Vax's architect & VP, Gordon Bell, asked for details,
which were cheerfully provided by the shirt-wearer.  Gordon then hauled
a bunch of managers into his office. They came out white-faced, under the
threat that heads would roll if it happened again.  DEC banned the shirt.
The shirt salesman, another DEC employee, had to re-order more shirts to
sell. They now sold like hotcakes.

Urban myth?  I don't know.  But it makes for a good story.

I worked in -10 land at the same time as you, John.  I would not have
said there was a "wall" between the -10 and VAX software groups.  It was
more like a state line.  I don't think the VAX folks paid much attention
to us 36-bitters (pun intented) near the end.

In hardware-land in Marlboro, the wall was more of a permeable membrane,
with lots of the Jupiter guys being reassigned to the Venus (VAX 8600),
then later the AquaVAX.  Neither of those machines really fit into the
mainstream of VAX hardware, though.

Of course, "Aquarius".  "Expensive Boat Anchor" might be more like it.
A couple of them saw life as VAX 9000s in customer installations.

I think the project was originally named "Aquarius" because the plans
were for it to be liquid-cooled.  A follow-on air-cooled project called
"Aridus" (as in "arid", or "dry") was in the works too.  Late in the
project, they decided to drain the water out of the AquaVAX and sell it
dry.  It sunk like a stone in the marketplace.

Funny thing happened a few years later (1985 or so).  Me and Bob Houk
(ANF maintainer at the time) and a few other folks trooped up to
Littleton to hear a talk on a brand new concept called "link state

This isn't so surprising.  Both are an outgrowth of work at BBN for Arpanet
routing.  You'll be pleased to know that that same protocol designed for
Phase V is part of what's holding the Internet backbone together today.
You may also be saddened to hear that it's the same protocol...  with no
progress since then.  ;-(

Don't be too sure of that.  While I didn't design the ANF-10 protocols,
I don't recall that the people who did had any ties to BB&N at all.  I
left C-MU in 1974 where I did a lot of ARPAnet support (I think I installed
the first FTP client on the ARPAnet in September 1972 before visiting my
family in Germany.  There were no servers to try it against and when I
got back found it didn't work.  Sigh.

I was not real strong on the IMP-IMP protocol, and I've forgotten the
details of the ANF-10 routing code so I may be mistaken.

NCL, the ANF-10 transport protocol, was designed by scaling DDCMP (DECs
link level protocol) up a level and doing some other straightforward
stuff.  I did write specs for adding multi-path support (I don't remember
if I implemented it) and hierarchical routing (which I definitely did not).

This is based on a true story, but the details are a quite different.  First,
this occurred between sometime '81 and '84 (83ish time frame seems about
right).  At that time the 10/20 folk were in Marlboro, not Maynard.  There was,
let us say a certain amount of enmity between the Marlboro folk who did 10's
and 20's and the Vax group which was in Spitbrook.  Tewksbury was close enough
to Spitbrook, and sounded better when combined with nuke, hence the slogan
`Nuke Tewksbury'.

It's also possible that this sentiment might have had something to do with the
fact that Tewksbury was where the DECnet architects were.  People in LCG were
never totally happy with DECnet...

So, if memory serves me, one fine day, there was a party at the Computer Museum
comemmerating some event.  An aquisition of some sort, or getting some old
computer running again.  I don't recall.  During those days, the museum was in
MR2 (I think that's called MRO2 today) which was the building right next door
to MR1, where LCG still reigned.  Smelling free food and liquor, an expedition
from LCG was mounted to attend the party.  I believe that a person who we will
call Mark H. was among the raiding party.  Apparantly, Gordon noticed his
shirt, and asked for a closer look.  Gordon saw the offending words, and was
apparantly not pleased.  I *think* what happened was that either the shirts
were banned at company events, or some sort of a dress code for public events
was instituted.  What is for certain is that the story grows in the telling...

Let's see, now.... The date was a count of the number of days since 1st 
January 1964 except that each month was assumed to have 31 days, so one 
year has 12*31 days = 372...
Eleven years have 4092 days and 12 bits represent 4096 days, hence 5th 
January 1975 was a bad hair day. Moving on, 33 years = 12276 days and 
3*4096 =12288 which means that 13th January 1997 is, indeed the third 
great overflowing! Gosh, doesn't time fly.

I remember in the UK that the only system we couldn't fix in time was the 
one at Farnborough which was used to bend and try to break the prototype 
Concorde super-sonic passenger plane in a huge heat exchanger. They 
bought the system with 4S72, or was it 4N50 and, even in those days, were 
not entitled to upgrade to 5-series. And they wrote all their results to 
Dectape which was a particular DATE75 problem area. A third party was 
involved to sort them out but I never found out what the outcome was...

I have posted a reproduction of the documentation for a VERY early
word-processor-like program, which ran on a PDP-1 with 4K words (9K bytes)
of RAM in 1963.  I think the program was written by Pete Samson, although
no names appear in the documentation.  For your nostalgic pleasure:

You betcha. My impression of the PDP genealogy:

PDP 1,4,7,9,15: 18-bit machines
PDP 5,8,12:     12-bit
PDP 6,10,20:    36-bit
PDP 11:         16-bit
PDP 2:          Never built
PDP 3:          Designed, never built by DEC, but rumor has it a customer
                bought DEC modules and assembled one. Don't know word length.
PDP 13:         Never existed
PDP 14:         Industrial automation controllers. Don't know word length
PDP 16:         Not a machine, but a system of register-transfer modules
                (memory, ALU, etc) from which a customer could build various
                computer-like devices. I used them in a class at Michigan; I
                believe DEC donated lots of 'em after they died in the market.
                They came out just in time to be obsoleted by the increasing
                level of integrated circuits of the time.

True, but it was reserved for a 24-bitter according to MRC.

36-bits. One was built in 1960, according to MRC.

12-bit, but with a 1-bit accumulator.

Exactly.  The PDP-1, PDP-4, PDP-7, PDP-9 and PDP-15 were related in that
regard.  The later 18 bit machines were not compatable with the PDP-1,
though.

DEC Press has come out with a wonderful book, Digital At Work, that includes
photos and overviews of the specs for most of the PDP machines, as well as
predecessors like the MIT TX0.

You can find a short table of these attributes in the first part of the

Yes, that book is rather fun but there are a number of errors in it that
may be confusing at first. I seem to recall that one of the pictures of a
'PDP11 System' is actually a VAX 11/730 (or maybe the other way round),
etc. My favourite error is the fact that a very nice picture of a PDP8 of
some flavour has been printed left-right reversed, or at least, I think it
has (unless there was an ASR-33 like teletype with the punch on the right,
and a single DECtape drive that filled the _right_ hand half of the rack
panel).

None-the-less, there's a lot of good stuff in it, and it's certainly worth
buying if you are interested in the old DEC machines.

I hadn't noticed that one!  Page 50, lower left.  Not only is the tape
reader-punch on the ASR 33 on the wrong side, and the TU 55 drives with
their tape reels on the wrong side, but you can clearly read the unit
number on the upper drive -- a backwards 4.

I get the feeling that layout professionals really like people to face
to the right in profile views, and that that photo is as likely to have
been left-right reversed when it was originally run as an advertising
photo back in the 1970's as it is to have been reversed in for the book.
I've seen other left-right reversals in DEC ads from that era.

Ain't revisionist history wonderful! Actually the Nova was descended (as 
opposed to decended) from the PDP-X (or X-project) at DEC. This was DEC's 
first attempt at a 16 bit machine, rejected by the operations committee. 
Eventually a new design emerged as the PDP-11.

You've been talking about a program called nroff.  Since I was the first
group leader of the RUNOFF group at DEC, would you mind enlightening me? 
We had a NRUNOF (sp?) for a while when the commands were being modified so
that semi-colons could be a terminator character of a formatting command
and the commands were shortened to 1-2 characters.

Early in the history of UNIX, back before Version 7 and the great UNIX
explosion, there was a fairly simple text processor used for formatting
the manual pages. It was inspired by "RUNOFF" and called "ROFF" (when you
work on ASR33 teletypes, you like making command names short!).

Joe Ossanna did an enhanced version of this program, with pretty sophisticated
(for the time) macro facilities. It came in two versions: "nroff" (new roff)
generated lineprinter output, and troff (typesetter roff) generated output
for the Graphic Systems C/A/T phototypesetter. Later versions of troff and
ditroff (device independent typesetter runoff <grin>) supported more devices.

Later, the GNU folks did a from-scratch version of nroff/troff called groff
and it's what most rational systems use for their UNIX manuals these days.
It generates lineprinter and postscript output, mostly.

The *roff family aren't near so sophisticated as TeX, but they're a heck of
a lot easier to use... especially when it comes to debugging errors in your
markup... TeX's error cascades are, well, pretty amazing.

>Hey, kudos to you and all the RUNOFF group.
<snip>
Thank you.  Maybe it's time to document more of the ways we used to work
when  Digital was DEC.   

As the programming staffs grew, the work load at Tape Prep grew.  The jobs
would come in, be assessed for length of time the job would take, and get
put into a priority list.  It got so complex that nobody (writers,
reproducers, nor programmers) were getting their jobs done on time.  So
Tape Prep was reorganized into three groups: 1) the RUNOFF group which
would handle all work that needed to be done in RUNOFF,  2) the
quick-turnaround group which took in jobs that could be done in less than
an hour or so, and 3) all the rest of the jobs.

At that time, all documentation that was published and shipped by DEC was
done on typewriters by a group of (about) 20 women.  None of that stuff
was on-line.  A few exceptions were the -10 functional specs and (I think)
the processor manual.  After getting broken in, I decided that everything
should start to be done on-line. I began a campaign to convince writers to
type their stuff on-line; there were some who preferred to write on paper
but not many.  It took some convincing that a complete retyping of a
chapter wasn't needed just because they added one text line; this was the
case when the documents were done by typewriters.

The RUNOFF group gradually transformed itself into a real typesetting
group (long after I left).  RUNOFF was not very good at manipulating text
for publishing but it was very useful.  For instance, double columns that
were automatically left/right justified and space-filled were impossible
to do, but we managed [smiling emoticon here].  I believe that the only
job I ever turned down was submitted by a one of the five V.P.s (for the
life of me I can't remember the name).  My boss was insistent that I do
the job for fear that the VP would get unhappy.  I pointed out that he
would be even more unhappy when we produced a sloppy job that took 20
hours/month to do.  What he really wanted was a VISICALC piece of
software.  This was in 1972; there was no such thing.  I turned down the
job, explaining to him that it was more efficient for someone with good
secretarial skills to do the job since the software didn't exist.

I was always sorry that all those women (of the typing pool) were
eventually put out of a job but I was not sorry to finally get that
documentation into bits.  Interestingly enough, the person who made a
transition to typing on-line from the pool was a woman who was considered
to be backward; but she could type 120 w.p.m.  When she was being trained
to work on a computer, the decision was being made that she wouldn't be
able to learn RUNOFF.  The plan was that she would WYSIWYG the
documentation into a file, and someone, like me, would insert RUNOFF
commands to do the formatting.   That was unacceptable and I insisted that
she be taught RUNOFF commands, monitor-level commands and everything in
between.  She learned and she just loved it.

I think you perhaps misunderstand, Barb (JMFBAH) was not responsible for the 
creation of RUNOFF, but for its DEC-wide adoption as a documentation 
standard.

The story of RUNOFF's creation is another piece of DEC folklore. Some person 
(who's name is lost to history) had created a "text-processing" program that 
ran on the PDP-10. He wanted to sell it to DEC. He came to Maynard one Friday 
and demonstrated it to a group of us -10 types. He was careful to remove the 
program from System 2 before he departed, but left behind some documentation. 
On Monday, Bob Clements showed us how he had spent his weekend. He had 
written a program that basically conformed to the guy's documentation. Bob 
called his weekend project RUNOFF.

Jerry Saltzer wrote the RUNOFF command for CTSS on the MIT 7094.
I remember using it for documentation in 1965, so it was a public
command by then.  Saltzer acknowledged inspiration from TJ-2 and
expensive typewriter.

I believe the R formatter of ITS came after RUNOFF.

Doug McIlroy, Rudd Canaday, and Dennis Ritchie
wrote a version of runoff for 645 Multics in BCPL, so that the Multics
group could use its own system for documentation.  Both of these
runoffs took input lines beginning with dot as command lines.

Bob Morris and Dennis Ritchie moved the BCPL runoff to BTL's
GE-635 and called it roff.  McIlroy then wrote a roff from scratch
in BCPL, expanding and improving on runoff; Ken Thompson and Dennis
Ritchie then wrote a machine-language version of roff for their new
system, UNIX, about 1970, to justify the purchase of the PDP-11.

DEC's RUNOFF command might have been inspired by CTSS's, since
the DEC engineers who went to MIT in the 60s would have seen it.
Or it might have been an independent invention, with a coincidence
in names.

R was well after runoff -- done in the Dynamic Modelling Group (home
of Zork) and well after the more popular TJ-6 formatter used for ITS
documentation.

The following is from Bob Clements, the author of DEC's PDP-10 RUNOFF. The 
reason I'm posting (as opposed to Bob) is self-explanatory:

"Hi, John,

I haven't been posting lately due to getting ticked off at the resulting
junk email.  Haven't had time to fix the environment to hide my address
properly.  Feel free to post this if you omit the cleartext form
of my email address.

In article <5daa2f$lfc$1@kirin.wwa.com> you write:

>The story of RUNOFF's creation is another piece of DEC folklore. Some person

Well, this isn't how I remember it, and it gives me too much credit.

I don't remember anyone coming to offer such a program to DEC, but it
might have happened.

The actual origin of RUNOFF on the -10 was indeed me, but I didn't
write it from scratch or from specs.  I did a fairly direct translation
of the source code for SDS-940 RUNOFF, which was written at UCB.
I had to redo the I/O and system call stuff, of course, but the
text formating logic was all straight out of the Berkley code.

If you can find a copy of the source code of RUNOFF, you'll see big
sections with registers named A, B and X (I think that's right), which
were the main registers of the 940.  It didn't have general registers
like the DEC machines.  That code was just plain copied.

Today, I suppose you'd get in trouble for that.  In those days, it
wasn't that big a deal.  Mea culpa."

nroff is an old time Unix program that replaced roff, and older and, as far
as I know, lost program.  (And probably no loss.)  troff is a nroff
variant designed to talk to the Graphic Systems phototypesetter, but
various paths exist to talk to PostScript an other current printing
systems.

Nroff files generally include macro libraries, typcically for man pages
or one of two for documents.

Random nroff sample:

.IP "\fBgateway\fP \fIhost\fP
True if the packet used \fIhost\fP as a gateway.  I.e., the ethernet
source or destination address was \fIhost\fP but neither the IP source
nor the IP destination was \fIhost\fP.  \fIHost\fP must be a name and
must be found in both /etc/hosts and /etc/ethers.  (An equivalent
expression is
.in +.5i
.nf
\fBether host \fIehost \fBand not host \fIhost\fR
.fi
.in -.5i
which can be used with either names or numbers for \fIhost / ehost\fP.)
.IP "\fBdst net \fInet\fR"
True if the IP destination address of the packet has a network
number of \fInet\fP, which may be either an address or a name.

Upper case commands are usually macros:

.IP - Indent Paragraph
.in - Indent (inches, points, etc)
.nf - no fill
.fi - fill

Embedded commands can change fonts - \fB bold, \fI italics.  I forget
what \fR and \fP are, but you get the idea.

I assume PDP-10 RUNOFF and nroff have a common ancestor, but have never
been curious to look into it.  The macro language in nroff has variables and
string processing functions that let the clever author do some
remarkable things.

There was R which ran under ITS and used similar dot commands as I
remember, and I thought R started life on CTSS. Can't say that with
any authority, just vague memories. The point being that there was
some relationship between "R" and "RUNOFF", the letter R wasn't
coincidental.

Yeah, We had an Imlac <something or other> at BBN in the Early 70's. I
don't remember much about it excepth that its assembly language was
virtually identical to a DEC system (maybe even the PDP-1) but it had
another processor in it that ran some graphics stuff (a "display list).
It was sitting back near the MTIMP (The Mag Tape IMP - yes, back then
there was a serious attempt to do realtime mag tape transfers over the
ARPAnet; this was before TCP/IP, though :->   )

I could guess, but I expect that it's not common knowledge that WortStar
_was_
written by a PDP-1 programmer. Wordsatr (as orifginally written for the
Imasi (I think))
predates RUNOFF (predicessor to nroff). 
I don't know TJ-2, but I did write a text justification program for the
PDP-1 that was
implemented in Logo. (I also wrote some of Logo, that was written for
the PDP-1 in Assembler
- Midas (predicessor to MACRO) but that's a different story.

?????  RUNOFF (on MULTICS) dates from the late 1960's.  That begat RUNOFF
on the Bell Labs GCOS system (I have the manuals for it that I got when
I worked at Bell in 1973), and that begat NROFF and TROFF in around 1973.
(The CAT Phototypesetter was still a hot new toy at Murray Hill when I
was there).

Nothing developed for the IMSAI predates any of this!!!!

A far more interesting lineage is the one that links TJ-2 to HTML.  Anyone
want to lay it out in full?  (Hint:  HTML grew in the context of SGML,
which originally grew in the context of a type formatter on the IBM-360
family, which was based on ideas developed at IBM Cambridge Labs, which
had a connection with work done on CTSS at MIT -- the common ancestor
from which RUNOFF grew, by the way -- which was, no doubt, inspired by
TJ-2.)

High their:

In the late 60's & early 70's I worked for a company (Medidata, later
Searle Medidata) which started life as a not-for-profit spin-off from
Lincoln Lab. (as I have heard), called American Science Institute.  The
chief engineer, Ed Rawson was a friend of Dec's Olsen and he managed to
get hold of the modules used for the prototype PDP-2 which never
reached the market.  ASI used them to build their own machine
(designed, I believe, by Chuck Corderman) which they called "Casino"
and was sometimes jocularly referred to as a PDP-2 1/2.  Casino was
noteworthy for having, very early in trhe game, graphics capabilities.
It also had some special terminals which had labels that cannot be
repeated on this (family) newsgroup.

Nope. The LINC-8 was a PDP-8 (I?) sharing a box (and, I think, memory)
with a LINC. It was a commercial product from DEC, and worked because
both the '8 and the LINC were 12-bit machines. The LINC had a bunch of
analog I/O and was useful for monitoring and controlling lab
experiments. The PDP-12 was the next generation of the LINC-8, and the
LINCtape evolved into DECtape.

I seem to recall that Cooley Lab at the University of Michigan wrote a
simple operating system for the LINC-8 which went on to become OS/8.

The first LINC was built in 1962 at Lincoln Labs using DEC logic modules.
By the end of 1963, an additional 20 or so machines had been built by
their end-users.  At first, users simply purchased parts from DEC, but
then DEC began to sell the parts as a kit -- was this the first computer
sold in kit form? -- and as I understand it, DEC even allowed some
customers to assemble and test the machine at Maynard and then haul it
home ready to run.

In late 1964, DEC began to manufacutre and sell ready-to-run LINC
systems, made to order.  All this happened before the 1965 introduction
of the PDP-8 and well before the 1966 introduction of the LINC-8 (a machine
that could run both the PDP-8 and LINC instruction sets.  Eventually,
DEC built and sold 21 LINC systems, while customers built 29.  In
addition, DEC sold 142 LINC-8 systems, and something like 3500 PDP-12
systems were sold to follow up on that success.  Others also came out
with LINC clones, for example, the Spear MicroLINC.

Actually, the last TOPS-10 released by Digital was 7.04.  There were
some updates which included enough changes some insiders considered
the result 7.05.  I'm not sure when Ethernet support was added but it
was probably 7.01 if not before.

I don't know what XKL calls their version of TOPS-10.  The web page
at toad.xkl.com doesn't say.

No, it wasn't until 7.03 that the Ethernet (the NI-20) and the KLIPA CI bus
disk/clustering interconnect (CI-20) were supported.  I strongly remember
being quite envious of the 7.03 ship party T-shirt, which had "CI told you
NI knew we could do it!" on the back.  (I came into DEC10 Development just
after 7.03 shipped.)  Now, some versions of in-house 7.02 likely had the
KLINIA and KLIPA support in them, but as far as shipping versions went, the
first one that went out the door that had the support was 7.03.

Dunno either; when I saw a rough version of TOPS-10 at the San Francisco
DECUS in 95 it was 7.04 of some flavor.  It would be nice if XKL managed to
get the final frozen sources, but I haven't a clue.

Dr. Douglas Engelbart gave a talk today at JavaSoft about the activities
of the Bootstrap Institute.  He was going to demonstrate their Open
Hyertext system and explained that Augment/NLS had been written for a PDP-10 
when he was working at Tymshare in the late 1970s, and that it had
never been ported, so the Bootstrap Institute still runs a "DEC-20" system
in Fremont, CA.  For the demo, Dr. Engelbart set up a Sparc SS-20 which
was going to run his software under a PDP-10 simulator.  Alas, the demo
never got off the ground; due to configuration problems, all we saw
was Smalltalk error messages.  He said that the little Sparc pizza box
outperformed the whole set of PDP-10 cabinets.

	Hmmm, I thought it looked familiar, but the "Runoff"-like

I may even have a manual buried in those boxes of books in the attic.
I never actually had an account on the '940, being an undergrad
at the time, but I _did_ pull cable for its terminals and once even
repair one of the boards in the terminal interface. For you young'uns,
this was a rack of DEC "System Modules" (Preceded Flip Chips, and
were also used on the PDP-6 we had) where each line interface (what
we'd call a UART today) used two or three cards. I know the tranmitter
and receiver were separate, I just don't recall whether there was
also a separate "control" card. Perhaps I can stir some memories
out there. These little wonders were so well designed that the
later UARTs from Western Digital and General Instruments pretty
much copied them verbatim (Perhaps they were designed to DEC spec),
and I always get a little peeved when I run into a serial interface
that is _less_ well designed but done later (8530, 8250, Rockwell VIA...)

	Anyway, the odd thing I remember about Autosecretary was
that it output a tape that had to be flipped over and fed to a
Flexowriter. Apparently Friden and Teletype had differing ideas
about where the sprocket holes should go :-)

: If you can find a copy of the source code of RUNOFF, you'll see big

 Matches my recollection, although as I said before I did not get

24-bit words per process (about 64 or 128K total) could do. OTOH,
the limited per-process space made "fork" the tool of choice
for task decomposition, and I'm still living with _that_ headache
today on my company-issue Unix machine, _years_ after per-process
address space made single-address-space tasks possible...
(I also blame them for making "delete" the default "interrupt"
key. Made using the paper-tape reader a real thrill :-)

	As I recall, Project Genie (the 930->940 conversion and

freely distributable.

    Here's what the Great Microprocessors List has to say about the
various descendants of the PDP-8 - the complete descriptions are
available in the list from my home page,or the CPU Info Center at:

    http://infopad.eecs.berkeley.edu/CIC/

Great Microprocessors of the Past and Present (V 9.2.2)
[...]
Section One: Before the Great Dark Cloud.
[...]
Part V: The 6809, extending the 680x (1977)

    Like the 6502, the 6809 was based on the Motorola 6800 (1974), which
was initially based on the design of the big endian DEC PDP-8, though
the 6809 expanded the design significantly. [...]

Section Two: Forgotten/Innovative Designs before the Great Dark Cloud
[...]
Part VI: Intersil 6100, old design in a new package

    The IMS 6100 was a single chip design of the PDP-8 minicomputer
(1965) from DEC (low cost successor to the PDP-5 (1963)).
The old PDP-8 design was very strange, and if it hadn't been
so popular, an awkward CPU like the 6100 would have never had a reason 
to exist.
[...]

Part VII: NOVA, another popular adaptation

    Like the PDP-8, the Data General Nova was also copied, not just in
one, but two implementations - the Data General MN601 (MicroNova),
and Fairchild 9440. However, the NOVA was a more mature design (by PDP-8
designer Edson DeCastro, who came to Data General from DEC).
[...]
    Another CPU, the PACE, was based on the NOVA design, but featured
16 bit addressing, more addressing modes, and a 10 level stack (like
the 8008).
    The 32 bit ECLIPSE (pre 1983) was Data General's successor to the 16
bit Nova. [...]

Part VIII: Signetics 2650, enhanced accumulator based (1978?)

    Superficially similar to the PDP-8 (and IMS 6100), the Signetics
2650 was based around a set of 8 bit registers with R0 used as an
accumulator, [...]

It's not at all clear to me what the line of descent between a machine
(6800) with

	two accumulators (mostly orthogonal)
	PC relative displacement branches
	condition codes
	8-bit organization
	hardware stack
	index register
	vectored interrupts (admittedly primitive)

and a earlier machine (pdp8) with

	one accumulator and a totally non-orthogonal quotient register
	page relative branches
	no condition codes
	12 bit organization
	no stack
	no index register (I don't count mem locs 0010 .. 0017 as index registers)
	flat interrupts

might be beyond that fact that they're both small 2s complement von
Neumann machines.  I've hacked on both and they have totally different
`feels'.

In short, the 6800 doesn't seem to share a lineage with the pdp8.
The intersil 6100, definitely.

Ross

No!  As near as I can tell, the 6800 had nothing to do with the PDP-8.
Single accumulator machines were the rule, not the exception, from 1946
when Berks, Goldstein and Von Neumann first proposed the fetch-execute
cycle as we know it, and the late 1950's.  In the 1960's, virtually all
of the significant minicomputers were single-accumulator machines, and
strong shawows of that world-view held on in the first generation of
microprocessors.  The only major micrpocessor today with strong vestiges
of this worldview is, of course, the Intel family of 80x86 machines.

Anyway, someone needs to get their hands on the documentation for
Motorola's first 8-bit processor, the MDP-1000, released in 1968.  It
wasn't a microprocessor, it was a minicomputer, made with TTL, I think,
but I'll lay odds that the 6800 architecture draws on the experience of
the MDP-1000 far more than it draws on the PDP-8.

Also, John Bayko's list completely missed the HP 21XX series of
minicomputers.  Both the HP 21XX and DG NOVA series can be described
as 16 bit versions of the PDP-8, but in widening the word, the two
teams came to different conclusions about what to do with the extra
bits (HP used 2 accumulators, DG used 4, and so on).  DG was a DEC
spinoff, while HP (or rather, an HP subsidiary) was a major OEM customer
of DEC PDP-8 hardware in the mid 1960's -- so major that, according to
an interview published by CHAC, HP seriously considered buying DEC
before they decided to make their own machines.

I'm probably wrong on the 'who was first' here, but the Typeset-10
group at DEC (Tim Stein and myself, and others) wrote a driver for
the CAT pretty early after its introduction. It was a neat little
typesetting machine, and we were glad to get one because it was
the first 'real' typesetting machine we had in house. I recall the
date as 1973-74 or so, but could be wrong. Others who worked on
Typeset-10 included Dan Bricklin. Typeset-10 was roughly modeled
after Typeset-8, which was a wildly popular newspaper production
system. The -10 version (in MACRO-10) had a number of innovative
features, including a neat hyphenation algorithm that used a cute
hashing algorithm derived from the -10's ability to do infinite
level indirection and clever bit operations. It ran circles around
anything else that we knew of.

The Typeset-10 language was, in fact, modeled after the way that
MIDAS (the -10 assembler at MIT) handled macros. You could
do integer arithmetic in it, using the algorithms from
Peter Sampson's wonderful STRING language, which allowed for
infinite precision. Also, if you wanted,
you could ouput the results directly was word strings in english,
or as roman numerals. 

Originally, Typset-10 had been planned to use RUNOFF syntax, but
it was clear that such a syntax was too cumbersome. Some vestiges
remained, which was unfortunate or we would have invented TEX.

I recall using RUNOFF or something very like it on the 7094
CTSS system at MIT, which would have been in the mid/late sixties,
and of course MIT-AI later had a much more powerful
version for both the PDP-6 and later for the PDP-10. So I'd put
the evolutionary chain as CTSS --> MULTICS/MIT-AI and lots of
branches after that. None of which is to speak of Electric Typewriter,

'ey Bob!

I remember using that software to create great galleys.  I also remember 
 using your terminal, GT-40?maybe?.  I seem to remember that it sounded 
like a small airplane.  I would type in RUNOFF format, run the .RNO file 
through some kind of pre-formatter and then (somehow) get it printed on 
the machine that was on MRO-1.   It produced great copy; a great leap 
forward from the Diablo.

By the way, this is my first test of entering an item using this ISP.  
(AOL became a swear when it started to tell me to get off the system!).

People in this thread have been comparing RUNOFF and friends with TeX.
You might be interested to know that the PDP-10 was the host for an early
TeX precursor, the professional typesetting system that I worked on (along
with Lowell Hawkinson and some others) at Composition Technology
circa 1970, I believe the first program that handled high-quality
typesetting of mathematical formulas from user input in math terms
rather than exact positional terms.

I feel sure DEC still sells them, I've got a slightly oldish DAS catalog
in front of me that gives the part # as 29-22925-00 but doesn't have a
listing for it except as part of the PM kit 4A-PM116-00, which costs $131
but supposedly includes 2 of the filters and 10 prefilters (y'know, the
things that the manual says to wash in warm soapy water but if you do they
turn to dust and disappear).

YES, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  You *must* add a jumper
between pins E06E1 and E06C2 of the RM adapter backplane (that's the cage
that slides out of the base), and then you'll need to reformat it, but
MARK in the ITS salvager does that just fine (note that as distributed,
the RM80 version of NSALV 260 needs a patch to work correctly, see
ftp://ftp.dbit.com/pub/pdp10/its/build.info).  The KS10 that I ran under
ITS at Fornax in '92/'93 had an RM80 system disk and worked great, and
running on 115V with no air filters is a Good Thing.

And performance to match. As a charter member of the PDP-8 programming group 
(when the "group" was Roger Pyle and me) I had to test everything I wrote for 
PDP-8/S compatibility. Some of the most boring hours I've ever spent.

Related story (from memory, so caveat emptor): They were built in areas
of plants (ML, MR) which didn't have a raised floor with air
conditioning blown underneath, so they took clean air from above and
blew it down through the machine.  If you did have such a raised floor,
there was an ECO to reverse the fans to suck cold air up through the
cabinets from underneath the floor.  This also required turning the
backplane for some option upside down in its cabinet to prevent the hot
components that were carefully placed on one edge of the board from
heating up the rest of the board.

Quote from DEC's Small Computer Handbook, 1973, page 8-11:

   ... in general, air enters standard cabinets through the top filter
   and exits at the bottom ...

This applies to the standard DEC H960 "basic cabinet", a 6 foot 19" (EIA
standard mounting rails) relay rack with side skins, rear door and
fan/filter assembly built into the top.  This cabinet was used for all
kinds of DEC computer systems of that era, from the 12 bit PDP-8 on up
into the 16-bit PDP-11, 18-bit PDP-15, and into the 36 bit world (although
I think the PDP-10 CPU used a custom wide cabinet, with rows of H960
cabinets for peripheral interfaces).

The earlier CAB-1 through CAB-8 series of DEC cabinets used prior to 1968
were built with a fan in the bottom.  I don't know which way the air flowed
in these cabinets, but the original PDP-8, 1966, had bottom up flow with 
the fans in the power supply assembly halfway up the cabinet and just
below the CPU.

OTOH, at a PPOE we had a brand-new KL10 that ate circuit cards at
an alarming rate (all at DEC's expense) until the airflow was turned
around to use the air coming up from the raised flooring.  DEC had
been made aware that (like most computer rooms of the time) we used
underfloor cooling exclusively, but still insisted on delivering
and installing the machine with top-down airflow.

DEC had some wonderful design concepts in the KL10, coupled with
hideous physical implementations.  My biggest squawk about the
machine (I wasn't responsible for the KL10, but was involved
with the electrical power for the computer center) was that that
the machine was dumping ~15A of current down the ground wire, and
the DEC CE could not understand why I was upset.  (The KL10 used
3-phase AC power; there was significant current in the *neutral*
line because the loads were badly unbalanced, but that's at 
least within Code specs.  Current in the *ground* wire isn't supposed
to be present.)

They discarded all the DEC equipment quite some time ago, I believe, retiring
it in favour of Systems Concepts boxen.  There's only one guy in the entire

At the going-away party for Stanford's PDP-10s, someone had an old
catalog of 36-bit systems.  It listed the 1010, 1020, 1030 and 1040
models.  I asked about the KA's without FM and byte hardware, and he said
that although DEC had such items in the catalog, none were ever sold.
All customers opted for Fast Memory and byte-manipulation/floating-point
hardware.

I would like to know if there are any counterexamples; sites that admit
to purchasing a KA without FM and FP.  (I do not believe there are any.)

I would also like to know there are any of these ancient catalogs still
around.  I want to get them scanned and posted to my website.

I worked in manufactiring on the PDP-10. I can't remember if any machines
went to customer sites without the FM option on the KA10, but I do
remember that a few machines were shipped without the floating point

Anyone here ever work at one of DEC's internal datacenters that used 10's?

PK-1 was the biggest datacenter - full of them back in the late 70's & 80's.

I worked in PK3, and then PK1 when it became DEC's main corporate datacenter. 
I wrote & supported many of the applications on the 10's 20's & RSTS machines.

It was always impressive to go into the computer room.  There must have been a 
half dozen 10's there, and a 2 or 3 20's, and a bunch of 11's.  The computer 
room was the size of a football field (in fact I believe a football was tossed 
around in there during some 3rd shifts...)  The whole place hummed from the 
systems and dozens of disk drives.

Lots of funny stories.  Like the time there was a water leak from the roof, 
and someone covered some of the 10's with the plastic emergency covers - but 
didn't turn them off...   Had some memory problems for a while after that.

DEC had a number of other datacenters running 10's:  Westminster, Marlboro, 
The Mill, Westfield, Colorado Springs, Gevena, Galway Ireland, Puerto Rico, 
Nashua NH, Ayr Scotland, Phoenix, Reading England, Kaufbeuren Germany, 
probably a few more I don't remember.   They were all connected very early on 
(early 70's) with an imprssive network for the time.

Oh, dear! I think I'm beginning to feel my age.  I _still_ don't consider 
the RP01/2/4/6s to be monsters; and the RP07s are new young things [tongue 
in cheek emoticon here].  I consider the monsters to be things like the 
Bryant Drum; they _were_ hazardous to your health just by running (usually 
after you).

Another story is that JMF leaned against an RP04 (they were really good as 
a door jamb to lean against when talking to somebody) and later discovered 
that his credit cards weren't any good w.r.t. the magnetic strip.

Also, when TW wrote the TOPS10 device driver for the RP07, I heard him 
remark that he didn't see the need for this disk drive.  He figured that 
the disk space provided by the RP07 was overkill and that noone needed so 
much space.  I really heard him figure that, assuming no one ever deleted a 
file on the RP07, it would take years to fill up that disk---three months 
later, he verbally ate his words;  JMF and I made sure of that [grinning 
emoticon here].

The RP06 has 20 surfaces, 19 are Read/Write surfaces for data and one
surface is a servo track used to position the heads over the desired
track. 

Yes, the RP06 has a 3 phase motor and it's phase sensitive. If the phases
are not in the proper sequence the drive would never come on-line. Lots of
fun when the customers electricians are doing some work or even the public
utility decides to make some changes. The RD10(Bryant Drum) was also phase
sensitive.

The RP07 used a sealed Head-Disk Assembly (HDA), when it failed, and it
failed very often the whole HDA was replaced at large prices to DEC.


Don't foget the famous Bucode TU40 tape drives. You could write a tape and
5 minutes latter you were lucky if you could read it back.

Chuckle...I was wondering when somebody would remember those 
pain-in-the-neck tapes...TW (who usually did the magtape device drivers in 
TOPS10) always claimed that "god did not mean for there to be magtapes".  
After using TU45s and dealing with maintenance/development of BACKUP, I had 
to agree.  The ones I did like were the TU70s; those babies could hum!

Oh, John.  Mea culpa, mea culpa.  I was remembering the Marlboro days when 
I was part of that wonderful group on a day to day basis.  I humbly ask 
your forgiveness for not remembering those wonderful Mill days when I only 
tasted the flavor of the atmosphere 1/2 day a week (when I editted the

All this talk about the RIM10B reminds me of a bootstrap
I had to write.  It had to fit in 16 words.   Not the 
accumulators, but, I think,  locations 20 through 37.

It had to load ITS  (well, actually a secondary loader
that would load ITS)  from a disk.  Not only the pdp-10 code
but also the channel program had to reside in the 16 words.
That was tight!

For those of you who may not recognize the reference,   ITS was
the incompatible timesharing system,  which was built at the MIT
AI lab to run their PDP-10s.  I worked at Dynamic Modelling, just
down the hall from AI.

Much as I love RIM10B, I think the award for tightest-coded
bootstrap of all time has to go to the IBM 7094.  Remember that?
When you hit the "Load Cards" button on the console, the machine
read three (3) words from a punch card, which then had to read
in the rest of the card, and then a magtape.

Not likely an RP01.  DEC took delivery of eight.  No RP01s
ever left the engineering development lab (5-0 and KA10 #1).
The RP02s were working before any RP10 was installed in
the software development lab (12-1 and KA10 #2).  DEC talked
Memorex into taking the RP01s back even though they were
painted in DEC colors.

Ah, we have something in common!  I was the last developer to use System #2 
before DEC got rid of it.  Just wanted to let you know how long that 
particular piece of hardware lasted.   I used System #2 to develop the 
USAGE accounting system.  Nobody else wanted to use a KA (KLs were in vogue 
then) and it was a marvelous little system, hidden away in deep bowels of 
MR1-2.

	Yes, they were great machines.  Does anyone here remember "System
26", the KA-10 built from scrap at Bedford-U, not the KL system 1026. ?  
(Or BEDFRD::, the DEC training facility at Bedford, MA)  If Dave Cressey 
is hanging around, I'm sure that he does.  A guy named Del Lippert was
in 
charge of Ed Services at Bedford.  The BEDFRD:: node was also the only 
system as I recall on the DEC internal network to buck the "Digital
Standard 
Node Naming Procedure".  I asked Cressey why that was, and it stated
that
it was "A Del-Lippert-ate act..."

	System 26 was the Energizer Bunny of the PDP-10 world, it
just kept running and running and running.  None of the cabinents
were painted quite the same shade of blue, and even the black cabinents
were finished different.

Hmmm...  Here's my recollection:  System 26 was reconstituted in the
lab at Marlboro,  not Bedford U.  Before Ed Services concentrated its
Boston area training in Bedford,  there was Maynard for minicomputers,
and Marlboro for Tens and Twentys.  We had been using the services of 
the KL in the fishbowl to support our courses,  but we were faced with
too many cases where our students were descheduled from labs to make room
for that KLs prime mission, which was to impress "real customers"  (as
opposed to our students <g>).

So a hardware instructor (later a supervisor)  started putting this thing
together for us, that became "system-26".  26 from the processor serial
 number. I don't remember if the original purpose was to support 
software training
or hardware training.  But eventually it became a software machine,  and
we found that,  for some courses,  it did what we wanted better than
the machine down the hall.
 
I began managing it on an informal basis.  Big mistake.  Then I got
sent on an 11-week assignment to teach assembler and monitor courses
in South America  (in Spanish!).  when I got back,  my greeting from
a colleague who will remain nameless  was:  "Did you enjoy your 
vacation?  How come system 26 is is still running the old software?"
I almost decked him.

I could easily be wrong about this next one,  but I think that system 26 
got left behind in Marlboro when we made the move to Bedford.  I may
have suppressed that phase of my existence.  Or it may have been moved,
but put in the hardware lab instead of the software lab.


I don't remember making a  comment about a "Del-Lipperate Act",  but it
sounds like me, all right.  They say the memory is the second thing to
go.  I've forgotten what the first one is.

Regards,
    Dave Cressey

Are you sure this was the PDP-2, and not the PDP-3?

According to _Computer Engineering_ by Bell, et al p. 141

"The PDP-2 designation was saved for a possible 24-bit machine, but none was
ever built.  DEC also never built a PDP-3, although one was designed on paper
as a 36-bit machine.*"

"*In 1960 a customer (Scientific Engineering Institute, Waltham, Massachusetts)
built a PDP-3.  It was later dismantled and given to M.I.T.; as of 1974 it was
up and running in Oregon."

It sounds remarkably similar.

In any case, I would also be interested in knowing more about the 2, and the 3. 
Anyone know where the above mentioned "PDP-3" wound up?  Or if there any
existing design prints?
