RT11 runs fine on LSI/11's both in a standalone, but also in some third
party networked applications. A company in the Netherlands, Techlan,
made redundant token passing network cards for Unibus and Qbus, booting
them of a central RT11 server. They went very well indeed in a diskless
environment, used for process control by companies such as Outokumpu
the Finish mining comglomerate and in conjuction with Gamma 11 systems
from DEC/Philips.... so should have run fine on an console LSI-11

I had them install it to play with in the Piscataway, NJ field office
for me.

The real reason to do it was so I could sysgen my PDT11/150.

A little exchange or mcr flx and I'd have the floppy copied.

My other method to do the sysgen involved getting sent to DEC training
and bringing up an RK pack to do the sysgen with in the lab DEC used 
for Field Service Training. I did it there for four years. 

DEC security got too bitchy about it the last time and confiscated the
pack so they could check I wasn't stealing VAX/VMS cluster sources on it
(someone was caught doing this a couple of weeks earlier) and it 
became policy that no media went in/out without inspection.

Took them about 6 weeks to get me my pack back and the #@$%^& crashed it
when they shipped it.  I took out the DEC Finance RK05 when I booted
it on a PM.  The thing had a 1/4 inch bend in the platter where it
contacted one of the screws that held the disk pack together in
shipping.

Damn, I miss the fun of RT11 on the PDT. Nothing like the sound of the
Reset and seeks on the RX's.
<click> <click-clack> <click-click-click> 

RT11 ran great on the 11/70's  -- just that RT11 didn't support it
officially.  I think they didn't deal with the Unibus map so it wasn't
officially supported on the 11/70's.

I used to lock down the best 11/70 in the lab by booting my RT11
pack on Sunday evenings.

I'd drive up from NJ a bit early playing adventure for a while and 
run the RT11 light pattern on the best 11/70 in the lab (I'd use RT and
the diags to find the machine least likely to be really broken before
the Field Service class would whack at 'em).

I'd spin down the drive leaving the light pattern from RT running
and hang a sign on the box Sunday about 10pm saying Operating System
Test in Progress Do Not Disturb.

When class started the next morning my machine was tested, staked out
and ready for me.

I'd boot XXDP and off through the field service classes but reload the
RT pack and rehang the sign every night.

We used to run the PDP-6 from DECtapes when the disks where scrod...
That was real DECtapes though, and quite reasonable.

I have also run a 11/44 from TU-58 as the system disk. I can promise
you, it is something you never want to do. To init it I set it going,
then went to the tavern across the road for lunch. I think that is the
only way you can, other wise you will kill off the `failed' init...

Light and blunt please, we want it to be *SLOOOOWWW* and painfull!
Pity no one did a RSP disk or floppy for diags and the like...

Three phrases: VAX-11/730. TU-58. Microcode load.

The TU-58 was a cassette tape (actually, a miniature QIC, IIRC)
interfaced through a DL-11 UART, used as a block device, usually
with an RT-11 file structure. It made a DECtape look good.

I heard to my amazement, that the Soviet VAX-cloning group cloned
the 730, TU-58 and all. That was so stupid. They should at least
have replaced the TU-58 with an 8080 controlling a floppy disk.
