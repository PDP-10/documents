Thanks to the generosity of Johnny Eriksson, I received paper copies of
the 7.03 and 7.04 MIGs today.

I have scanned about 30% (up to chapter 6) of the 7.03 MIG and put it up
at :

   <ftp://aconit.org/pub/dec-10/MIG703.TXT>

It's pure ASCII text. I've done a first cut at proof reading/formatting.

I'll do the rest of the 703 MIG tomorrow, the 704 later next week.

Enjoy....

The change bars indicated the portions of the manual that changed
from the previous manual.  We tried to use that as a "head's up"
warning to the customer.  The way a customer kept up-to-date
with our software changes that affected documentation was to read
the change bar text lines; that way the customer didn't have to
completely reread the manual to figure out what we changed that
might affect his computer usage.

I don't know.  If there were any changes in procedures installing
those REACT files might be useful.  I never looked at them so
I can't tell you how important those few pages are.

Things have (obviously) been very busy here in the past month,
but I hope to have roughly a dozen new tapes unpacked and available
at the PDP-10 archives soon.  In the meantime, I've been stacking
huge piles of documents through the scanner here, and among the goodies
now available is the TOPS-10 Command Manual for TOPS-10 7.01.

See
 
http://mudd.trailing-edge.com/scandocs/tops10/AA0916D-TB_TOPS-10_Commands_Manual_7_01/book.pdf

for all 432 pages in one giant 11.5 Meg PDF, or feel free to browse
the individual pages by clicking on the *.png files in the
directory

http://mudd.trailing-edge.com/scandocs/tops10/AA0916D-TB_TOPS-10_Commands_Manual_7_01/

Each individual page is in the 30-60 kbyte range.

Enjoy!

For those not familiar with TECO, I recommend trying the SED editor that is
available for both TOPS-10 and TOPS-20.

Take a look at the following web page.  It has pointers to all TOPS-10 and
TOPS-20 documentation that I am aware of.  
http://www.aracnet.com/~healyzh/pdp10emu.html

Unfortuantly there isn't enough TOPS-20 documentation for it to be easy, but
I can guarentee that it is possible to get a system running with what does
exist even if you've never seen a TOPS-20 system in your life!

Yes, Bob Supnks's guide on these pages (parts 1 + 2) and the TOPS-20
7.1 installation guide is close enough. Also I nearly fell over when I
saw *

"Introduction to using the DECSYSTEM-20, originally from the Dundee
College of Technology (TEXT)" also on these pages.

As that's the machine I used to run! Even more surprising is it was
retyped by an ex student there who now works for me with my current
employer on VMS. The author credits are DEO/KLB who were Duncan Ord
and Kay Black but the version online is the 1983 edition updated by
myself. Think I might have printed copies of the Dundee Tech guides to
EDIT, BASIC, FORTRAN, TOPS-20 advanced etc at home if. I could only
find them and scan them in.

In these days I was:

Alan%DCT@UCL-CS.ARPA

or COMPD-ARG%DCT%DDXA@UCL-CS.ARPA even earlier

Had a TOPS-10 PPN before that but (shame) I can't remember it now with
any accuracy.

We took part in the TOPS-20 V5 field test and had online copies of
*all* TOPS-20 docs from that time as part of the kit. I am still
trying to track down tapes on which these might still exist..

You can find a scan of a poor photocopy
of the pocket service guide at:
   http://208.190.133.201/decimages/moremanuals.htm

Look for:
  EK-VT100-J1-004 VT100 Series Pocket Service Guide 

I don't have the full service manual but
I'm almost sure I have seen one somewhere
on the net. A few quick searches yielded
nothing :-(

OK, I've now got a fancy-pants (by my standards!) HP Scanjet IIcx with
sheet feeder, and have run a couple thousand pages of old DEC documents
through in the past couple days.  The sheet feeder is wonderful, I can
put in a stack of paper and then go out and paint the garage and come back
in later to do the next bunch.  And the IIcx+ADF works incredibly well with
Linux and SANE (see http://www.mostang.com/sane/ ).

For ordinary black-text-on-white-page documents, I just use the scanner
in automatic threshold mode and I get clear crisp scans, which I can then
turn into G4 compressed TIFF's or PNG's or GIF's or whatever.  I can even
take the whole collection of scans and make a big PDF out of them.  That's
all wonderful.

But some of the documents (for example, the TOPS-20 software installation
guide) are more complicated.  They have large halftoned gray boxes (that is,
the original doc has the gray area made up of a bunch of little black dots),
red text, and red text in halftoned gray boxes.  So far I've been scanning
these in as full-color (RGB) 24-bit 300 DPI images (about 25 Mbytes per page)
and then using tools to clean up these scans.  I've developed some
pretty good algorithms for analyzing for the presence of gray boxes (i.e.
finding the halftoned areas) and cleaning up the scans of both black and red
text in these gray boxes.  After the 25Mbyte raw scan has been massaged,
the result is a PNG that is only 70 or 100 kbytes, and I'm happy with that.

I would be even happier if I could make a compressed TIFF of these black and
white and gray and red images, but G4 TIFF compression only works on bilevel
(black and white and no gray).  If I look at the man page for 'pnmtotiff', it
tells me that some TIFF encoders/decoders can do LZW compression but that this
capability isn't universal.  I'm unfamiliar with tools and platforms outside
of what's installed on my personal boxes; is LZW-capable TIFF widespread?
(I'm asking this as a practical question, and I don't really want to get
into the legal issues regarding Unisys's LZW patent, though obviously they
are related and the patent has limited the capabilities of at least some
software implementations.)

I know that others here have done scans and made the results available as
JPG's, but I'm fundamentally opposed to doing any lossy compression.
I also feel that JPG's are just stupid when applied to line-art type images,
but I'll only say that once to not insult too much those folks who use it :-).

Mostly I'm writing this just to organize my own thoughts on the issues involved,
and I think I can summarize by saying:

1.  I like non-lossy compression.
2.  I want to use a format which is easily viewable on a wide range of
    platforms.
3.  I'm really proud of my little piece of code that cleans up black/white/red/
    gray scans.  (If I ever get around to 11M+ docs, I may have to add blue!)

And I think I'm asking:

1.  What format is most useful?  PDF's seem OK (though some PDF-printing
    software seems to re-rasterize my 300 DPI scans onto their own grid and
    the results look a little odd), and I can also make web-browsable (i.e.
    indexed, forward, and back) HTML indices of GIF or PNG images that allow
    individual pages to be viewed without downloading the whole document.

2.  Is the format that's most useful for black-and-white also the most useful
    for black-and-white-and-gray-and-red?  What opinions do folks have on
    "useful" formats?  Do you violently disagree with any of my thoughts?

That's it for this morning.  Tonight I'll start putting some of my scans
up at pdp-10.trailing-edge.com for y'all to see and complain about (or maybe
even use!)

Tim.

OK, as promised you can see my scanned docs at

  http://mudd.trailing-edge.com/scandocs/tops20/

In particular, see the program "timify7.c" (the seventh in my
series of attempts to auto-discriminate the gray and red areas)
and its outputs in the aa-4195f-tm (TOPS-20 V3A installation guide)
subdirectory.

My apologies for the nearly complete lack of comments in timify7.c.

In that subdirectory, you'll find 25-Mbyte *.pnm's which are the raw
300 DPI 24-bit color scans, and the *.png's, which are the "digested"
pages that are only tens of kbytes.  In some cases - especially, say,

   http://mudd.trailing-edge.com/scandocs/tops20/aa-4195f-tm/out138.png

the output looks wonderfully nice.  In other cases, the output has lots
of gray lines near otherwise black horizontal lines where my discriminating
software went a little too wild about deciding what was gray and what
wasn't.  I have some ideas about cleaning this up, and maybe they'll
happen tonight :-).

I thought it came out pretty good...

Tim, you might want to play with the gamma setting on scanner when
you do the color scan before conversion. It looked like the contrast
was a bit low.

Apart from extended addressing sections and huge updates to the
available EXEC command processors there is not a great deal of
difference. Most of the EXEC changes up to V7 could be retrofitted. In
fact the version of EXEC that comes with 4.1 is the V5 EXEC. Should be
possible to build a V7  PCL enhanced EXEC on V4.1 given a week or so
worth of work.

OK folks, many times over the past years I've promised that
there are ways for me to index the thousands of megabytes of stuff
in the PDP-10 archive collection at

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

and that I would do this indexing when I had some spare time.

That spare time happened between 4AM and 8AM this Saturday
morning.  The resulting "test site" is far from complete, but
it does contain 7000 files (totaling about 100 Mbytes) unpacked
from the DECUS LIB10 tapes (although not their abstracts!)  See

  http://new-pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

for what is available so far.  I've used the HTDIG search engine
to generate a searchable index, and it seems pretty robust in my
testing.  Please use and abuse the "new" site to your heart's
content, as I'm planning on migrating all the PDP-10 material
to it in the next few weeks, and any feedback I get early on will
make the experience less traumatic for all of us :-).  I'm
particularly sensitive to how the site may show up under text-based
web browsers, though any complaints or suggestions will be
happily received.

I have discovered one problem with HTDIG so far: it refuses to
show the timestamp for any file from before 1-Jan-1970, although
it does seem to correctly sort-by-date before then.  I can't
be the only site on the web with files that have preserved their
timestamp from before 1970, can I? :-)

If some more spare time materializes Sunday morning, I may add
the DECUS LIB20 tapes and maybe the 10BACKUP format DEC distribution
tapes to the "new-pdp-10" site.  The DECUS abstracts (I found my
old 1983 DECUS LCG catalog again!  The wonders of cleaning the
basement...) will probably be at least a
week away.  Once things settle down I plan
to release the tools I use to generate the site and indices from
tape images so that anyone can set up their own private searchable
PDP-10 archive, if they wish.

There are two listings in the TWONKY filesystem I recently put up:

in DSKA: [7,3,BOOT]
   KLPCOD  MCR  1690  <455>   30-Apr-87    1A(724)
   KNICOD  MCR  1512  <455>    8-Nov-85    1(171)

They are not sources but rather output listings.  The latter appears to
be from something called ND167T.MCR[4,204] (version 167T, I assume) dated
2-Feb-84.  Don't know if that was the last version, but that is what
I worked from while doing the NIA20 emulation.

  http://www.aracnet.com/~healyzh/TOPS-20_notebooks.html

has some of the notebook set.  Although not all of them are available,
it looks like they've done some of the most important first.

The processor reference manual doesn't seem to be in that set, but it
is in the set at

  http://www.36bit.org/dec/manual/

If you can find Ralph Gorin's book Introduction to DECSYSTEM-20
Assembly Language Programming, that's a good introduction to the macro
assembler itself, the instruction set, and the most important system
calls.  It was by ftp at toad.xkl.com for a while but I don't see it
now.  A good university library would have it.

There's also a newbie users' document at

  http://www.36bit.org/dec/third_party_doc/dundee_pi16.txt

As far as legality, there's a Digital license agreement at

  http://www.36bit.org/dec/license.html

There's a webring about the pdp10 at

  http://n.webring.com/hub?ring=pdp10&id=1&hub

with lots to read in its sites.
