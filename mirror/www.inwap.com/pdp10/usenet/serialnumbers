My search above only displayed serials 102x.  The list I have contains
over 30 KL systems with serials below 1100.

2476

I thought it was also the ARPAnet TOPS-20 development system as well,
but recently someone here with a knowledge of where the various cards
and options were installed said they doubted that a 1091 could have
BOTH an external memory controller (DMA20) *AND* a KI10 I/O bus
adaptor (DIA20) which would have been required to talk to the IMP
interface...

Do you mean PDP-10 I/O bus (TD10) connected DECtapes?
Of _course_ they had them on their front ends!

	Anything with a serial number below 2100 (or so) was
	manufactured as a 1090 (or 1080), in bright blue "high boy"
	(rack height) cabinets, with "external" core memory that had
	multiple ports, and could be used for SMP.

	The higher range were either 2040/2050/2060's (orange) or
	1091's (a paler blue), in "corporate" (VAX height) cabinets,
	with "internal" semiconductor (MOS DRAM) memory.

	2065's (and 1095) were manufactured in the FCC RFI safe boxes
	(designed for Jupiter) were any of the FCC cabinets blue??

Here is a complete list of all the 10's at DEC Marlboro in the 80's;

I remember the Venus (8600) project had some 2060's they used for
development (wrote code to handle net lists in extended addressing
FORTRAN), but they don't seem to appear on the list (it's possible
they were absorbed by 36-bit engineering, and DO appear). The Jupiter
microcode people had a system "IO - One of Jupiters Moons" -- I
suppose that could have been #2530...

On the topic of low serial number KL's, here are two other famous systems:

1038	ITS	Macsyma Consort		MIT, Cambridge		KL10
1075	SAIL	SAIL			Stanford, CA		KL10
