As I mentioned in mail to Carl, the last few updates to TOPS-10 7.04 and
TOPS-20 7.0 included online manuals for newly updated volumes (basically,
the core OS manuals since layered products were in bug fix only mode
by then.)  I've since found my list of the TOPS-20 manuals delivered
with TSU 4:

        File name               Manual title (as best I can recall)
        ----------              -----------------------------------
        COMMANDS                Commands Reference Manual
        DDT44C                  DDT
        JSYS_REF                JSYS Reference Manual
        JSYS_USERS              JSYS Users Guide
        MGR_GUIDE               System Manager's Guide
        MODELB_INS              Installation Guide for KL Model B Systems
        MONITOR_TABLES          Monitor Tables
        OPRCOM                  OPR Commands
        OP_GUIDE                Operator's Guide
        SIX12                   SIX12 Manual (BLISS debugger)
        TSU                     TOPS Software Update Manual
        USERS                   User's Guide
        USER_UTILS              Utilities Guide (I think)

All with .MEM and in line printer format.  I think VT100 formatted
versions (filename_VT.MEM) made it onto the tape as well.

Ooops, another SPD that got through the purge.  All 36 bit related SPDs
were supposed to have been deleted by the end of 1993 when all corporate
support ended.

While knowing a specific part number and the magic phone number to call will
sometimes get you a part that DECdirect doesn't know about, I doubt it would
help here.  Calling Publishing and Circulation Services (or whatever they
are called these days) might.

I was able to spend some time yesterday on those boxes.  Here's
what I found.

Apparently, sometimes writers would give me a complimentary copy 
of the manuals I typed in.  Following is a list of a couple of
them.

decsystem10 system40 users guide  

    You know how old that is because of the lack of capital 
    letters and dashes.  System 40 used to be the name of 
    the in-house timesharing system and group.  (This
    was before the KA CPU #40 was transferred to the PDP-10 
    development group.  The system resided in 5-B (Building 5,
    the basement) which was one of the spookiest walks of the
    Mill; I did that walk just about every day.

    This document was aimed at PDP-11 programming types who
    weren't used to doing their work on-line.  It has keyboard
    layout diagrams and one section tells them what to do
    if the system crashes and there's no operator :-)))).  I'd
    forgotten such things happened; I must be completely PC'ed these
    days.

The cover says:
pdp11 PIP, File Utility Package, programmer's manual

The cover page says;
PDP-11 FILE UTILITY PACKAGE (PIP) FOR THE DISK OPERATING SYSTEM

Part #:  DEC-11-PIDB-D

   It has a closeup, but incomplete picture of some flavor
   of PDP-11 (purple) front panel.  The copyright date is
   1971.  And by gosh, by golly, it gives a list of the
   PDP-11 Disk Operating System software.  The first item
   is DOS Monitor.



pipc users manual   white cover with black printing and OS/8
                    printing date is 1973
Part #:  DEC-S8-OPIPB-A-D

   The c in pipc is for cassettes.  The intro recommends the
   document CASSETTE PROGRAMMING SYSTEM USER'S MANUAL.  It
   also mentions the CAPS-8 system.  So that's two OSes on
   the PDP-8:  OS/8 and CAPS-8.



project leader's notebook  

This has no part number as it was an internal DEC document.
The date is September 1972 and is probably the first stab
at creating the Project Notebook that was used to guide
project planning from inception to ship.  Dave Stone was
the guy behind this notebook creation.  Just before he
died he gave a talk to high level managers and consultants
informing them that the underlying goal of the notebeook
was to delay product ships.  And nobody asked him why that
was a goal.  One of the examples included in this manual
is the "Project Plan For The Multi-User Option for DOS-11"
I don't know if this stuff is even of interest to the 
computing biz history.

There's another item of real interest here but I'll separate
that one out into another post.

I worked on my boxes some more yesterday.  

[extremely awed emoticon]  I have a lewiney.

I also found a yellow phone book.  I don't know what to do
with this.  It's not going to given away on a FCFS basis
but I don't have a criteria of who should get it.

I found three redentions of my calling cards.  Are these of
any interest?  What do you guys do with your old ones?

I also found a 1980 Datamation that had Alan Wilson's paper
on TOPS-10 SMP in it.  I don't know if this magazine is of
any interest.

There's more.  But I'll talk about it later.

Note that nobody has said anything about the document lists
that I've posted twice.

Oh, sorry.  Don Lewine had a nervous habit of taking a piece
of wire and winding it into a coil.  One could always tell
when he'd been around because he usually left them behind.
One day we found one in the back room of the Marketing machine
and couldn't figure out why he had been there.

The wire would always have a coil at the bottom (I'm having trouble
describing this) with an end sticking up.  Then somebody would 
add a triangular shaped piece of paper and stick that on top
of the protruding wire end.

This hasn't been scanned?  I've also got the next edition of
the phone book (but it was blue and white) so it was no longer
called a phone book.

Awe doesn't get the stuff distributed ;-).
I am not looking forward to working on the one box that has
my files in it.  I have no idea what might be important or
of interest.  In my mind, everything is of interest, but that's
because of the associated memories :-).

Probably because no one would have enough time to do it.

I recently had to run a ten year old program for which the source files
were lost, only the listings from a report were available. I scanned
in thirty five pages of program, but it took nearly two months to
get it going. This was FORTRAN where variables do not have to be
declared, so misspelled variables were simply accepted. (Inserting
IMPLICIT NONE helped a lot.) Most common errors were confusion
between 1) zero,  and oh; and 2) one, lower case ell, and upper
case eye. Single quote marks often disappeared (or appeared).
Spacing was inexact. Not the same as simple text, but much work.

Actually, it's been in the archive for at least a year :-).

The latest doc tape is 

  Documentation Update Files
      for TOPS-10 V7.04
           DOCC
       30-Nov-1990

It has the following as *.MEM (line-printer-formatted) documents:

TOPS-10 Crash Analysis Guide (15-Nov-90)
TOPS-10 Operating Systems Commands Manual (13-Nov-90)
TOPS-10 DDT Manual (15-Nov-90)
TOPS-10 Monitor Calls Manual (2 vols) (23-Jul-90)
TOPS-10 Monitor Tables Description (August 89)
TOPS-10 Operator's Command Language Reference Manual (Sep-90)
TOPS-10 Operator's Guide (Sep-90)
TOPS-10 Software Installation Guide (Dec-90)
TOPS-10 Stopcode Specification (Jun-90)
TOPS-10/TOPS-20 Software Update User's Guide (Feb-90)
TOPS-10 User Utilities Manual (Dec-90)

All up for browsing (your choice of "with line-printer to HTML"
or "without-line-printer to HTML") at

  http://test-pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/tops10v704_docc/index.html

Now *some* earlier versions of these manuals are available as
*.RNO's on other tapes in the archives.  While I agree that it
would be good to have everything as *.RNO too, I'm quite happy that
these documents are available in any format.

Tim.

There are 919 files in the archive matching *.RN? (and presumably
mostly runoff source), and 416 matching *.MEM (presumably line-printer
docs.)  There are 1968 *.DOC's (again, mostly line-printer docs.)

One of the archive features currently under development is
search-by-filename-with-wildcards-and-return-result-sorted-by-date.
Implemented with BerkeleyDB under Perl, of course :-).

Whoops - remove the "test-" from the hostname to get the
official archive site.  The "test-" prefix takes you to my experimental
site, which in this case happens to be pretty close to the
official site, but is likely to change radically on my slightest
whim as I play with new indexing methods.

So the real, unlikely to disappear or change soon URL is

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/tops10v704_docc/index.html

Heh.  I got a strange burst of energy yesterday, took a TOPS-20
commands card, and a TeX manual (from a very nice man who went
shopping for me) and tried to figure out what kinds of TECO
macroes would be needed to convert a RUNOFF format to a TeX
format.  I was reminded why I hated Knuth's work; it is very clear
that he's a compiler thinker with delusions of professorism.  I'm
also too used to the way WE documented our stuff.  We did not play
fucking guessing games with the reader.  

Anyway.  I can (sort of) reproduce some of these cards using
RUNOFF (but not any of the system reference cards can be done),
but I can't do the art work with it.  

It was a very nice review of all the frustrations I experienced
when I was doing all of that DOC preparation work; RUNOFF did
tie my thumbs to the bottom of the keyboard.

Might be a start. Written in VAX Pascal.

It's a long time since I used it, but IIRC it worked OK for me
(though I did have access to VAXEN in those days).

Thanks to the efforts of Ronald Tatum working from a very bad copy, the
PDP-10 ALGOL Programmer's Reference Manual from the late 60's or early 70's
is now online at the PDP-10 Emulation Webpage.

	http://www.aracnet.com/~healyzh/pdp10emu.html

It is in seven parts with a errata page where Ronald Tatum did his best to
figure out what some of the 'smudges' on his copy said.  Unfortunatly
apparently whoever copied this back around '74 or earlier didn't consider 
the page that would have dated the manual worth copying.

As announced over a month ago, I am migrating the PDP-10 archive 

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

from the large, heavy, power-hungry VMSCluster to a small,
lightweight, and efficient linux PC.

Ignore the relation to the VMS vs Unix vs PDP-10 thread that has
been taking up so much space in this newsgroup.  The main reason
for this migration is nothing more than power efficiency - I can
keep a little PC (drawing less than 50 Watts) up for hours on a
cheap UPS, while keeping the older cluster up for more than a few
minutes on a big UPS is a hassle.

Not only will the webserver and files reside on a different machine,
but there will also be a number of other changes:

1.  No longer will *.TPC (DECUS TPC-style, blocks are preceded by 16-
 bit block length) tape archives be listed.  The archive of tape images
 will be offered solely as as *.tap (emulator-style, blocks are
 preceded *and* followed by their 32-bit block length) images.

  Internally I will continue to use *.TPC tape archives for some
 purposes.  But my impression is that the emulator community is
 much better served by the *.tap style images.  If anyone disagrees
 with me, speak up!

2.  The compression method for tape images will change as well:
 Instead of gzipped (*.tap.gz), they will now be compressed with
 bzip2 and filenames will be of the form *.tap.bz2.  Bzip2 offers
 significantly better compression (10-20%) on these images, and
 it adds up when there are many thousands of megabytes of them.

  More bzip2 informattion is available at

   http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/

3.  The extracted files will now be prepared using the "backup10"
 and "read20" programs, which I have been patching up over the
 past month to the point that I am very happy with their capabilities.
 My patched versions of these very useful tools will be made available
 shortly.

4.  The web pages that index into the archives will be more CSS
 (style-sheet) oriented and less table-oriented.  I aim to make the
 resulting pages easily viewed on both graphical *and* text-based
 browsers.  At the same time, I will also be making use of
 server-side includes to make web site maintenance easier for me.
 (Read that as: if you point out an error on the home page, I hope
 to be able to fix it more quickly than the couple of months it
 now takes me to get around to it!)

5.  A site search engine will allow searching of the extracted files
 quickly and efficiently.

6.  An index of scanned and line-printer documents will eventually
 happen.

Many of the above elements can be seen already at the "test site",

 http://new-pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

but not all the above elements have yet been combined (for example,
as of Sunday morning the test site still uses tables extensively.)

The actual switchover will occur early in the morning of
21-Jan-2002 EST.  The old archive will remain up and going even
after the switchover at

  http://old-pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

for at least a few weeks, as I perfect the redirects and rewrites
of URL's.  Besides, if I shut the old cluster down at this time of
year the basement would get too chilly :-).
