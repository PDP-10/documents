The PDP-11 frontend is booted from (2 8-inch) floppies to run RSX-20F.  One of
the .TSK files is a KL boot program that knows how to talk to magtape.  This
program is loaded via the DTE into main memory and started.

The boot tape, in BACKUP format, is read to find the monitor, which is loaded
into memory.  One of the options in a newly started monitor is to inscribe a
filesystem onto a disk, and this is done next.  Next, the BACKUP program is
executed from the boot tape (being file 2 on the tape; I was never quite sure
what the program in file 1 did), to restore all the contents of file 3 to the
new filesystem.

Answered above.

>(About KLDCP/RSX20F - Are these interchangeable?)

No.  KLDCP was an older program that ran from paper tape; I know that there
were KLs that used it, but I never booted one myself.

Of course.  How do you think *we* did it? ;-)

The PDP-11 frontend is booted from a pair of DECtapes on a KL models 1080 and
1090.  Originally, the front end ran a program loader called KLDCP (KL
Diagnostics Control Program, I think).  Later on, the program loader was
replace with a PDP-11 operating system, RSX-20F.

On a fresh install, the sequence was:
1) Load microcode into the KL from DECtape or 8-inch floppy.
2) Load DDRPI into the -10, run it to do a low-level format of the RP04 or
   RP06 packs.  (Convert the packs from IBM 3330-II format to 36-bit format.)
3) Load BOOT to read SYSTEM.EXE from 1/2-inch tape or another disk.

There were two copies of BACKUP.EXE on the tape, in case the first one
got a read error.

On the KS-2020, the first file on the tape was the KS-10 microcode.
Then SYSTEM.EXE, BACKUP.EXE, BACKUP.EXE, and a full save in BACKUP format.

Inside the Monitor, there was a section called the "ONCE dialog", which
had the code for defining disk structures.  After leaving ONCE, that section
of physical memory would be zeroed out and made available for user programs.

Inside of ONCE, you could dissolve an existing disk structure, define a
new one (multiple disk packs comprising a single structure), or REFRESH
an existing structure.  REFRESH was a high-level format; the HOME blocks
were rewritten, a new MFD created (with [1,1].UFD, [1,2].UFD, [1,3].UFD,
[1,4].UFD, [1,5].UFD, [2,5].UFD, [3,3].UFD).  Inside [1,4] were the initial
system files, HOME.SYS, SAT.SYS, and FE.SYS.  The latter was a collection
of consecutive blocks reserved for the console front end.  Once FE.SYS
was created, the front end program (KLDCP or RSX-20F) would copy the
entire contents of the DECtape or floppies to it.

At power-up, the console PDP-11 would boot itself from the disk, then
automatically start executing a script of KLDCP or RXS-20F commands to
reset the KL, load its microcode, load its boot loader, and start it.

At a very low level, they were functionally interchangeable.  KLDCP ran from
DECtape or floppy, not paper tape.  At Tymshare, we continued running KLDCP
off of DECtape long after RSX-20F came out, because RSX-20F did not provide
any additional functionality that TYMCOM-X could use.

I'm hoping that someone might be able to answer some questions that
I have ....


   1)  What is contained in a TOPS-20 installation kit?  That is, how
many tapes, and what is on them (in general).

   2)  What is the structure of a TOPS-20 installation tape?  Specifically,
a KS10 installation tape.  I'm looking for a description like "The tape
consists of a boot block, followed by a standlone restore image, followed
by a DUMPER image of the boot structure ...", etc.

   3)  Can anyone give me a quick overview of the process of installing
TOPS-20 on a KS10?  I have some TOPS-20 documentation around, but that info
does not seem to be included in the manuals that I have.

Thanks,
--Pat.
