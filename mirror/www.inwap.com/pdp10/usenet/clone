Yes to one.  No to two.  However, I would hardly call it a DECsystem-10.
It is 10 architecture hardware running on a custom opsys which has
as an ancestor a very very early version of TOPS-10.

No.  CSNI (Compu-Serv Network Incorporated, their name at the time)
had a Tuscon facility which was building a 10-look-alike.  It was
cancelled before it could be completed.  It was cancelled before
the Jupiter.

C$ now uses Systems Concepts' 10 look-alikes, I think.  I left a long
time ago but that is what I think I heard from friends who now run much 
of the company.

Well, the compuserve ID, which consists of two octal numbers separated by a comma, is just an old DEC PPN number in disguise.  To lo=
g in to the DEC-10, one used this same type of number. I know cause I did a lot of logging in during the 1970's.

Also, I heard that Compuserve used some DEC-10 clones, some made by a company in California called Foonly Computers. Anyone have any=
 information on this?

Bad News - No Jupiter.  The CompuServe people (almost put a $ in there but
decided to be nice) basicly did things with Systems Concepts for their 
box, and maybe somerthing with Foonly folks...  othere cn comment on that
stuff.  But, noi Jupitert (I am on a box that has no active delete key!)

I am looking at a binder marked "DECsystem 4050  Sales Training Seminar"
in chocolot brown, buyt it is nothing but the binder...  sad, sad, sad.

There are/were 3 companies that make clones:

Foonley (now defunct) was a spinoff from the Superfoonley project at the
Stanford AI Lab. They got ARPA funding to build a processor 10x faster
than the KA-10. When the project folded, DEC picked up the design (and a
designer or two) and built the KL-10. The KL-10 built upon the
Superfoonley design, but there were differences (ECL vs. TTL, etc).
Foonley built several models of their clones.

Systems Concepts was a company founded by some of the old hackers from the
MIT AI Labs. They've built paging boxes for the KA-10 (They may have been
the first, and its what was used for the Tenex OS), and a lot of other
hardware projects.
They are still making them, as far as I know.

The most recent clone maker is XKL, of Seattle. XKL was founded by Len
Bosack of Cisco, after he left. I don't know whether they've delivered
product yet, but you can see pictures of it in their web pages (whose ptr
I have conveniently lost).

Never heard that one.  Not even from my insider friends at DEC 36-bit
Engineering.  Doesn't mean it didn't happen, but it's highly unlikely.

Now *that* is true:  They licensed the Systems Concepts design from Levitt and
Nelson, because SC couldn't curn 'em out fast enough.

    Also, I heard that Compuserve used some DEC-10 clones, some made by a
    company in California called Foonly Computers. Anyone have any
    information on this?

FOONLEY had a couple models of PDP-10 clones.  I believe that they were
generally KA or KI clones, sometimes with BBN pager clones.

The Foonly F1 was faster than a KL by virtue of being hardwired
instead of microcoded, or so I heard.  One got a lot of use in some
early hollywood computer graphics efforts.  I don't think there were
very many.

The F2 was a small pdp-10 clone (one or two 19" racks.)  

I don't know if there was ever an F3.  The F4 was a faster F2, with
ethernet and stuff.  I spent some time adding TCP to TENEX for use on
F2s and F4s.

The F5 was supposed to be a tiny version of the F4 (as in multiple F5s
would fit in a 19" rack, or a single F5 would fit by your desk.)  I don't
think the F5 ever made it to production, but it was supposed to show up
in the early to mid 1980s.


Other PDP-10 clones include the Systems Concept SC30-M (and related?), a
nice system that left a lot of spare room in a 22 inch rack.  SC started
out doing things like IBM Channel adaptors for dec equipment, and I think
the SC30M could talk to IBM disks.  Lots of people were interested in the
SC30M, which was a little faster than a KL, but SC seemed to have trouble
pricing and producing the machine in "production" quantities.  Mid to
late 1980s.

And of course there is the new XKL machine.

In addition to having a wide variety of PDP-10 clones, Compuserve did some
work to improve the cost-of-ownership of "real" dec-10 iron.  For a modest
fee (well, comparitively speaking), they'd come out and replace the old
linear power supplies of your KL10 with modern switching power supplies,
increasing power efficiency from about 30% to 80+%...

ARPA put up some money for Foonley to build F5s for SRI -- this at about the 
time that the workstation was coming into being (Xerox 
Dandelion/Dolphin/Dorado, Three Rivers Perq, BBN Jericho).  The thinking was 
that they could be personal Lisp Machines that could also run other things.   I 
piggy-backed on the buy to get a TENEX machine for what was at the time the 
Naval Ocean Systems Center in San Diego, figuring it would be cheaper than all 
the time we were buying from BBN and ISI.  It took forever (2 years?  trying to 
preserve the money over government fiscal year boundaries), but we finally 
received what was tagged a Foonley 4/5 in (I think) 1983.  It had, among other 
interesting features, a memory-mapped graphics display which I don't think that 
anyone ever used.

Foonley wasn't like DEC in terms of support -- while the Foonley had a built-in 
telephone connection for remote diagnostics and microcode replacement, more 
significant repairs involved getting someone to come down to San Diego from the 
converted elementary school in Mountain View.  Fortunately, our system manager 
had a nice sailboat, and the offer of a weekend on the water was frequently 
sufficient to entice a one-day support visit.

Dan Lynch once looked at our machine room, holding the Foonley, two VAX 
11/730s, one Perq, a BBN Bitgraph terminal and similar oddities and pronounced 
it the greatest collection of bad choices he'd ever seen.  We somehow got work 
done, however.  I'm glad we didn't show him the STARAN in the other building.

Foonly also built the F3, delivering several (five?...memory fails
me) F3's to Tymshare in the 1980-82 timeframe.  The Kestrel Institute
had at least one, as did CCRMA.  I think SRI (CSL?) had one, also.  The
F4, a follow-on, was never delivered AFAIK.

That's an understatement.  There was precisely one, wirewrapped
kludge, done with low impedance (68 ohm I think?) twisted pair.  The
wire insulation was so thin, to get the low impedance, that the wire
cut through at the slightest provocation.  I don't think the machine
was ever very robust, especially with cooldown-warmup cycles.  But the
logic design was better than anything DEC put out.  I think the
graphics in one of the early Disney efforts in the "I'm trapped in a
video game" genre (TRON?) was done on this machine, which was located
at Information International Inc.

Glad you brought this up.  Where did the name "Foonley" (or "Foonly," as
I've seen it before) come from?  Was it someone's surname?  An in-joke that
goes right over my head?

Tymshare had several F3 system; I have the console (lights and switches) from
one in my bedroom.  They came in two 19-inch rack; one for the wirewrapped
CPU and 2 SMD disks, the other for the Kenedy tape drive and more SMD disks.
Microcode loaded from 1/2-inch tape only.  A little bit slower than a KI.
Carl can provide more details.

 : Foonley (now defunct) was a spinoff from the Superfoonley project at the
 : Stanford AI Lab. They got ARPA funding to build a processor 10x faster
 : than the KA-10. When the project folded, DEC picked up the design (and a
 : designer or two) and built the KL-10. The KL-10 built upon the
 : Superfoonley design, but there were differences (ECL vs. TTL, etc).
 : Foonley built several models of their clones.

The KL is more properly described as a compromised cripple of the Superfoonly
design - the primary compromise being that the I and M boxes were merged to
save money, at the cost of making the machine slower.

The original Superfoonly design was TTL.  The one and only Superfoonly
that was actually built (here at Information International) was
redesigned using ECL 10K, by 3/4 of the original design team. The
Foonly was more than twice as fast as a KL-10.

Superfoonly required a console computer to boot it up, load it's
microcode, and so on.  The original concept was to use a PDP-11, but
the expedient thing turned out to be to use a KA-10 as the console
computer (as an interim measure) and eventually to build a cheap
pdp-10 out of 2901s and use it as the console computer.

Foonly Inc. never made any more Superfoonlys, or delivered a real console
computer to triple-i, but the design for the console computer became the
core of Foonly Inc's business producing PDP-10 clones.

Actually, Mike Levitt is a Berkeley grad.  He started the company, and then
hired Stewart Nelson away from MIT.

One of their major products was the SA-10, a device which allowed the
connection of IBM bus-and-tag devices to the I/O bus on a -10; the original
SC-30M at Stanford started out with no Massbus channel, only an SA channel.

The TENEX pager was created by Bolt, Beranek, and Newman of Cambridge.  I never

They're a UWashington site; we're still working on our own.  I have other

I think the old ditty went something like this-

A foonly is not a 360,
A foonly is more like a 10.
A foonly is faster than lightning,
So I'll get a foonly, but when?

...When one of the memory bay linear power supplies in our KA10
at UCI crapped out, we replaced it with a Heathkit battery
eliminator- which sat on top of the bay and worked quite well
for a few weeks. Great machine.

Really?

The prototype SC30M used the SA10 for tapes only; disks were controlled by
an FA10.  I wrote the TOPS-20 FA10 code.  I'm surprised to hear that the
Stanford SC30M was shipped without Massbus channels; as far I knew no
SC30Ms were ever shipped using SA/FA channels.

The main lossage with SA/FA channels is that the world had changed.  IBM
peripherals were no longer price leaders.  Worse, it was not possible to
poll SA/FA devices the way you could poll Massbus devices; if you changed
the system's I/O configuration you had to build a new kernel.  This was a
big loss for TOPS-20 sites.

The pagers on the AI, ML, and DM KAs were not BBN pagers and I believe
that Stew Nelson helped build them.

Right.  The BBN Pager was a one-bay addition and a set of CPU mods
to the KA-10.  It was designed and built by BBN-ers.

The most common PDP-10 configuration on the ARPANET for some time was
a KA-10, a BBN pager and a Systems Concepts SA-10 for the disks and
tapes, running BBN-TENEX.

There were a lot of twisted pair, and the logic pages were huge: four

It might interest PDP-10 fans everywhere to note that while the
microcode for the KL-10 was being debugged on the wirewrap #2
machine, I discovered that JRST @. indeed hung the system . . .

Judd Leonard had it fixed a couple of hours later. Then I hit him
with XCT ., and that also hung the system: didn't check for PIs in
progress. He fixed this a couple of hours later too.

Its just hard to keep a good bug down. I have a theory that every
architecture has a canonical set of associated bugs. If someone could
manage to document these things, then the next machine designed
in that architecture could be debugged that much more quickly. Somehow
this never seems to happen  though . . .

The F3 was a modifed F2 made for Tymshare, Inc. circa 1979. It had special
microcode to allow it to interface to Tymnet, and microcode to make it
look approximately like a KL-10. (I finished off and debugged the paging
and trap microcode, and implemented the missing instructions which the
F2 lacked like ADJBP and DMUL).

What Fred delivered to us the night before Hallowe'en, 1985, was the original
prototype.  The MI channel was not delivered for 8 months; until then, we had
to use the 3380s.  That's why Stu had to do the work he did.

Mike certainly advertised the availability of SA-attached tapes for his boxes
at the one DEXPO I know they attended (i. e., I ran into them there).  That was
Anaheim, 1986.

Ah, there's the confusion:  The *ITS* pager =/= the *BBN TENEX* pager.  Now
that's not surprising.

I just ran across a letter written to Tony Wachs (TW) in 1985 from a Peter
Samson, Director of Marketing, Systems Concepts.  In it is a document
titled "Fifty Questons and Answers about the Systems Concepts SC-30M" and
a chart titled "36-bit Product Evolution".  Are these worthy of archive?

Yup. That's right. I'm beginning to remember more.  Jim's curiosity got
the better of him and he decided to see what the KI did.  Those results
made him wonder what a KA did. After he tried it, I think he said that the
KA "was the most right" of them all.

I heard somewhere that Foonley was the name signed on all the hardware prints
for one of the CPUs, possibly the KA-10.  Is this true?

Hmmm, after watching many of the plots actually being done (for the KL10), 
I recall the signature as being "S. Foonly".  However, the mind fades 
after so many years.  This was sort of left over after the conversion of 
the drawing package done by RDH, et al, at Stanford.  Larry Rogers and I 
did the initial command line conversion for that package to operate with 
the Standard Vt05 Keyboard since there were no "bucky" or "double bucky" 
keys to use.  Dave Gross did the actual drawing driver conversion for a 
large screen display and finally for the GT40 (or some variant)

When I asked about this here recently, I received e-mail from
rwa@cs.athabascau.ca (Ross Alexander) with the following explanation:

     It comes from the error diagnostic spat out by someone's pdp10
     assembler; if you said "foo" to it, it would say "foo: nli"
     (not legal instruction).  This became a sort of mantra.

As part of a small group that makes jokes about "inpitUL" (pronounced
"in-pi-TUHL" and which stands for "is not presently in the User List"), I
find this entirely plausible.

I don't know the whole story {but I was part of the KL team for a while}. 
I do recall that FOONEY (or more precisely supper fooney) was the name of 
either the paging or cache mechanism (can't spell the "a" word).

JFN was Job File Number (the thing used to handle files {and other 
items}) When you opened a file you did a GETJFN ac,,blk to get a small 
number to use to reference that file in the future.
