My suggested answers.  I'm not sure if everything's correct.

> What is a PDP-10?

The PDP-10 architecture is a family of 36-bit word-addressed machines.
They were manufactured primarily by DEC from 1964 to 1988, but the
line was cancelled in 1983 in favour of the VAX family.  Clones have
been made by Xerox PARC, Foonly, Tymshare, Systems Concepts, XKL.
Famous software running on PDP-10s include: EMACS (the first visual
text editor), ITS, TENEX, TECO, SPELL (the first spell checker),
ADVENT (the first? text adventure game), Zork, Dungeon?, and MacLisp.

A memory word is 36 bits long, which is also the length of the
general-purpose registers.  All user instructions are 36 bits and have
9 bits to specify an operation, 4 bits to specify a register, 1 bit to
indicate indirect addressing, 4 bits to specify an index register, and
18 bits to specify an address, offset, or immediate value.  The first
version of the architecture was limited to a virtual address space of
256K words; a later version extended this to a maximum of 1G words.

> What operating systems ran on it?

TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 by DEC.  TENEX by BBN.  ITS by MIT hackers.  WAITS
by Stanford hackers, developed from an early version of TOPS-10.
FOONEX, Foonly's version of TENEX.  TYMCOM-X, Tymshare's version of
TOPS-10 or TOPS-20.

I don't think that you need the "?" after "first".

I don't know what "Dungeon" was as distinct from Zork, but there were
certainly other dungeon-type games such as Haunt.

Other notable software off the top of my head: SUDS (Stanford University
Drawing System -- considered by some people to be the finest circuit
drawing software of all time), MACSYMA, MacHack (Richard Greenblatt's
chess-playing program, one of the first), TECH2 (another early chess
program), the first IMAP server, the first KERMIT program (the "K" in
KERMIT stood for KL10).

The interest in PDP-10s goes beyond mere "retro-computing"; SUDS is still
in production use with no obvious replacement.
