At what point during the instruction execution cycle does the
processor check for a halt condition?  After executing the
current instruction?  Before?

Do checks for traps and interrupts occur prior to fetch of
the next instruction or after?  Which occurs first, traps or
interrupts?

If an instruction references a location which does not exist
(for example beyond end of physical memory), a NXM fault is
generated.  Does this also occur in user mode?  (Or was the
monitor expected to know what was available and just not hand
out anything which didn't exist?)

Thanks in advance...  more questions possibly to follow.  Remember,
these questions relate to the KA10 (I'll have some for the KI10
and KL10 at a later time, maybe).

p.s. Max address for the KA was 2^18-1, for the KI 2^22-1, what about
     the KL?

   I'm assuming you're either inquiring about the HALT instruction
or a front-panel key-press. For a key-press, I believe that the
halt occurs between the end of the exec cycle and the next fetch
cycle. For the HALT, it should occur during the exec cycle.

    If I remember correctly (and I'm doing this without reference
to the books), the -10 line is interruptable at the end of the
effective address computation and at the end of the execution cycle.
Long instructions (BLTs and the like) are interruptable during
execution (they save state properly).

    Traps, as in the pdp11, don't exist on the -10. The -10 uses
UUOs (esentially illegal/unassigned opcodes) for that function.
They, I believe, get caught in the fetch cycle just following the
effective address computation.

   Yes. NXMs are absolute and are generated by the memory control
logic. The current mode doesn't mean anything. Keep in mind that in
later -10s (like the KI), the entire user space was supposed to be
mapped out by the monitor, and be valid, but hardware errors could
still occur.

   For any of the -10 architectures the virtual address space is
18 bits wide. The KI, KL, and I believe KS implementations have
physical memory addresses 22 bits wide.


   What happened Megan? A miraculous conversion? <grin>

Let's see:  The instruction set, the memory architecture, the I/O architecture,
the available peripherals (mostly), the marketing...

The only thing similar between the -11 and the -10 is, in fact, the appellation
"PDP" (which was DEC marketingese for "computer" early in the company's history
and stood for "Programmed Data Processor," to get around GAO regs).  The same
is true of the other two families, the (18-bit) PDP-1/4/7/9/15 and the (12-bit)
PDP-5/8/12:  Only the names are similar to the 16- and 36-bit processors.

Someone else was unsure about families other than the PDP-6/10; I think that
should serve as a reminder to them...

No, BINARY mode skipped all zeros.  36-bits of data were punched onto
6 frames of tape 6 bits at at time with the high-order (8th) bit set.
Unpunched tape was ignored when reading in BINARY mode.

In ASCII mode, all ones (377 octal, 255 decimal, 0xFF hex) indicated
a manual correction.  It was created by pressing the backspace button
on the paper-tape attachment on the ASR-33 Teletype and then pressing
the RUBOUT key.  That was done only for paper tapes created off-line,
when the Teletype's keyboard was connected directly to the paper
tape punch.

---------------------

5.6  PAPER-TAPE PUNCH

The device mnemonic is PTP; the buffer size is 43(octal) words (40(octal)
data words).

5.6.1  Data Modes

5.6.1.1 ASCII, Octal Code 0 - The eighth hole is punched when necessary in
order to make even parity.  Tape-feed without the eighth hole (000) is
inserted after form-feed.  A rubout is inserted after each vertical or
horizontal tab.  Null characters (000) in appearing in the buffer are not
punched.

5.6.1.2 ASCII Line, Octal Code 1 - The mode is same as ASCII mode.  Format
control must be performed by the users's program.

5.6.1.3 Image, Octal Code 10 - Eight-bit characters are punched exactly as
they appear in the buffer with no additional processing.

5.6.1.4 Image Binary, Octal Code 13 - Binary words taaken from the outputt
buffer are split into six 6-bit bytes and punched with the eighth hole punched
in each line.  Thre is not format control or checksumming performed by the I/O
routine.  Data punched in this mode is read back by the paper-tape reader in
IB mode.

5.6.1.5 Binary, Octal Code 14 - Each bufferful of data is punched as one
checksummed binary block as described for the paper-tape reader.  Several
blank lines are punched after each bufferful for visual clarity.

5.7  PAPER-TAPE READER

The devise mnemonic is PTR; the buffer size is 43(octal) (40(octal) data)
words.

5.7.1 Data Modes (Input Only)

				NOTE
	To initialize the paper-tape reader, the input tape must
	be threaded through the reading mechanism and the FEED
	button must be depressed.

5.7.1.1 ASCII, Octal COde 0, Blank tape (000), RUBOUT (377), and null
characters (200) are ignored.  All other characters are truncated to seven
bits are appear in the buffer.  The physical end of the paper tape serves as
an EOF, but does not caus a character to appear in the buffer.

5.7.1.2 ASCII Line, Octal Code 1 - Character processin is the same as for
ASCII mode.  The buffer is terminated by LINE FEED, FORM FEED, or VT.

5.7.1.3 Image, Octal COde 10 - There is no character processing.  The buffer
is packed with 8-bit characters exactly as read from the input tape.  Physical
end of tape is the EOF indication but does not cause a character to appear in
the buffer.

5.7.1.4 Image Binary, Octal Code 13 - Characcters not having the eighth hole
punched are ignored.  Characters are truncated to six bits and packed six to
the word without further processing.  This mode is useful for reading binary
tapes having arbitrary blocking format.

5.7.1.5 Binary, Octal Code 16 - Checksummed binary data is read in the
following format.  The right half of the first word of each physical block
contains the number of data words that follow and the left half contains a
folded checksum.  The checksum is formed by adding the data words using 2's
complement arithemetic, then splitting the 36-bit sum into three 12-bit bytes
and adding these using 1's complement arithemetic to form a 12-bit checksum.
[This is the same algorithm used for reading 78 columns of 12-bit data from
the card reader.]  The data error flag is raised if the checksum miscompares.
Because the checksum and word count appear in the input buffer, the maximum
block length is 40.  The byte pointer, however, is initialized so as to not
pick up the word count and checksum word.

Again, physical end of tape is the EOF indication, but does not result in
putting a character in the buffer.

The KA10 CPU logic occupied two bays, NOT including the core.

However, it was built from R- and B- series logic modules; most modules
of this series are only a few gates or flip-flops, roughly equivalent
to 74xx SSI parts.  There were a few fancier modules designed specifically
for the KA10, such as the six-bit datapath slice.

If the KA10 had been implemented using SSI and MSI TTL parts on hex-sided
modules (like the PDP-11/45, for instance), the CPU probably would have
occupied about a dozen modules.  Of course, the KA10 was released in 1968
and the PDP-11/45 in 1972.

All the file we currently have of the V4 monitor have just
been mailed to TIm. Expect to hear RSN ;)


A word about the machine they ran on.

It was the first sold. Serial number #4, memory box SN #1.
It had the harp. It was ordered without FM, but had it anyway.
I think there was some 'discussion' post order, and it was added
to the order.
CPU, 48KW memory, PTR, PTP(? rollie), CDR, LPT, DIS, MTAx4, 32 lines
plus CTY and TTY1, both KSR35s. Oh, and 8 DECtapes.
There was also LP1, a Mohawk I think.
There was a PDP-6 channel for the 2 CDC disks, and a DC-10
for the tapes. The tapes where a latter addition. TM10B with
4 TU-10s I think. Can't find my manual... Plus there was a
real-time interface setup for the IR Spectrometer, and other
stuff.

Now the DISKS and LP1 ( why LP1 you are wondering... ) hung
off a PDP-8. The 8 was the controler fot the disks, and the 6
was its 'FPU'... I think this would have to be one of the first
for both these ideas. OK, the FPU is just a divide, but still!
Special interface between the two, and from 8 to disks.

The man who did the code for the 8 is still at UWA. When they
come back from hols, I'll see if he will post anything he has,
or send it to Tim.

In 72 it was retired, replaced by a CDC Cyber 72. After about
3 months of quiet riot, a KA-10 was ordered. I think that was
not a complete shock, as the tape and memory went onto the 10.

That stayed till 80, when a KL-10E took over. That machine
is in the next room. And I have the 8 under wraps as well!
In fact, when I first joined ( belatedly ) DECUS, it was the
machine I put on my membership form. It is a 'real' 8, none
of this noncy suffix stuff ;)

If anyone has any other old stuff, PLEASE get it out and
into the archive.

Paul,

You forgot to mention the PDP-8 disk drive controller and the remote
peripherral computer interface. There was no PTP ever. You also forgot
the Precision display which now resided in the ACMS-WA barn in
Mundaring.  The console was an ASR-33 (I almost lived on it Sunday
Times photo to prove it). IGN has a bad memory for things he built on
to it and mine is not much better. PO Dufty might remember, but much
has passed under the bridge in his life.

Perhaps I can supply one data point (one machine) & you can gather others
to determine ranges to get info you want.

from the January 1973 report by Paul Jalics at CWRU:

(summarizing here) The CASE-10 was used as a research tool & for
system development & did not carry course-related or non-departmental
loads.

Configuration:

KA processor
128K word core memory (MA-10 & MD-10)


storage devices -

DF-10 memory channel (to RC-10 & RP-10)
RC-10 controller to RD-10 fixed head disk
RP-10 disk pack controller (8 diskpacks)
TD-10 Dectape controller (8 Dectape units)


terminals -

DA-10 interface/ PDP-8 / 2 ASR-33 / 8 VT02 displays
DC-10 dataline scanner / 2 Datapoint 2200 / Datapoint 3300 /2 Imlacs
(3 modems off DC-10)
Evans & Sutherland LDS I display processor (3 displays)

BA-10 printer controller / printer


Notes:

1) As this info was taken from his thesis for the
analysis of the PDP-10 TOPS-10 (10/50), it apparently pre-dated
the addition of the BBN pager memory box, TENEX operating system,
& IMP for ARPANET connection.

2) CASE-10 appeared with MIT-10, CMU-10, Harvard-10, Stanford-10,
(U of) UTAH-10, (SRI-10, & BBN-10) on the ARPANET by April, 1971.

So you might contact those universities for additional information.

If you want to know what the minimum required configuration was to run
a later version of TOPS-10
or TOPS-20, the place to look is in the DEC SPD's or the actual
monitor installation guides.

For early PDP-10 configurations, I think the best place to look for
what a "typical" machine would be equipped with is the DECUS PDP-10
library entries.  For starters, look at

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/www/lib10/

and examine the "Requirements" section of the abstracts.
You'll find that many early (as in late-60's or early-70's) programs
needed a dozen or two kwords of core and DECTape drives, and that
hard drive storage wasn't a necessity.

Tim.

Ugh.

A typical use of SOUP was to put the DECtape with original files on DTA0:,
mount
a scratch tape on DTA1:, and place the SOUP tape into the paper tape reader.
"R SOUP" and go out for coffee.  Not fun.

OK for version 4S76 of the Monitor, back when disks and drums were optional.

When did DEC stop sending out SOUP patches on paper tape?

The times I remember it being used in-house was in the early 70s
when the hardware was getting produced faster than the software.
One the hugest headaches was ensuring that three guys doing
three different projects started from the same base.  It ended
up being easier to mark the SOUP listings (I think...John
Everett or Bob Clements would know since they lived it) and
letting us (Tape Prep) than trying to SOUP.

I never saw patches on paper tapes.  I don't remember duplicating
that flavor of paper tape in Tape Prep.

The KA at the Colorado School of Mines was similar to what Ken reported.
This is from memory.

CSM had 192 K words of core (128 + 64).  The TOPS-10 Monitor took up
about 92 K, leaving 100 K for user jobs.  Except for when accounting
ran at night, CORMAX was 40 K (enough for 2 big jobs and some smaller
ones in core at the same time).

CSM did not have an RD; we had swap space on DSKA.

If I remember correctly, DSKA was a single RP02 and DSKB was two RP03s.

We had two: DTA0-DTA7 and DTB0-DTB7

Our BA-10 also had a card reader, a card punch, and a Calcomp 3-pen plotter.

Ah yes... Another trip down memory lane. :-)

Our KA's (a 10/55 dual processor system) originally arrived in 1968 with
CPU's number 16 and 17.

We had three MA-10 memories of 16Kwords each. Later we added three Ampex
memories of 64Kwords each.

The original configuration included two Burroughs RC10 (I think) fixed
head disks, of total capacity about 2MB each, primarily as swapping
disks. These took about five minutes to spin up to speed.

Four RP02's (in colour coded units, so that the operators could say,
"the red disk is busted") were later augmented by about a half-dozen
RP03s.

The CPUs had integrated paper tape readers and about two DECtape drives
each. 

There were two 7-track tapes, and later two Ampex 9-tracks.

A PDP-8 based DC68 Communications Subsystem provided terminal I/O to
about 60 terminals, mostly 20mA current loop devices, running at 110
baud. I think our two manually-answered modems connected into this. Also
a couple of CALCOMP plotters - a 565 and a big one. Our engineers did a
lot of "customisation" and produced new circuitry to make all this work.

To finish it off, we had a Card reader and line printer. In the fullness
of time we added PDP-11s as "remote stations" to allow card entry and
printout from the far corners of our campus and another nearby
university.

I still have the paper tape loaders for 48K and 64K versions of TOPS-10.
I also have most of the maintenance manuals for the '8 and many for the
KA.

I'm saying it didn't get shipped as a product.  There may have
been some sites that were running as a prelim field test (I'm
not sure since I was in Tape Prep and I didn't have access to
how the monitor group did its field testing at that time.)
He certainly could have had two processors bought and had

marketing people promised the universe in those days.  However,
in 1971 when I started working at DEC the monitor group was
on 3-5 where we did the monitor edits.  There was only one
processor (System #2) there.  

Now I certainly could be all wet but I do remember that, when
I got fired from Tape Prep, one of the things I had to do was
remove the group from the test dual system because my replacement
was incapable of doing any kind of field testing.  One of the
hardest things I had to do was to go to TW and apologize for
dropping out of the load test.

I could certainly be wrong but the withdrawal out of load test
was an embarrassment for me.

OK, I've now had a chance to probe further into the history of our KA.

When it arrived in 1968, there WERE two processors. One went into use,
the other was left in its wrappings in the corner of the Computer Room
until 1972. At that time, (with a new Director of the Computer Centre on
board) it was discovered that all the transistor leads had corroded, and
by tapping the boards you could make the transistors fall off!

The second processor (unused until then) was used to get everything up
and going again. The first processor was repaired, and I'm told that by
the time that it was running again, the 5-series Monitor was available
which allowed master/slave configurations.

Is that story consistent with everyone's memories? 

I approached two of our old engineers, who swore that it was a
single-processor machine. This had me really confused, since I wouldn't
doubt their word, yet I have our 1975 "User's Guide" which says it was a
dual-processor, and pictures of it as well!. And I DO have memories of
starting the first processor, then going to the second and starting it
at 400. The "new Director" of 1972 told me (just today) that the
engineers kept the second processor a secret from him, and he only
discovered it by accident!

I'd like to thank you all for uncovering this piece of history!

No, it was in a purpose-built computer room in the basement of our
building - the same one we use today. But at the time, they put offices
for engineers/programmers/operators/training sessions within the
computer room. So there was a lot of people-traffic through the place,
bringing in dirt, etc. And we have a very high humidity climate here,
which the A/Cs couldn't cope with because of the amount of time the
doors were left open. I'm told that the combination of dust and humidity
combined to attack the transistor leads. 

Alan Coulter (Director of 1972) said that he got all the engineers and
techos to pull out all the boards, and scrub them down in the kitchen
sink. They then replaced all the transistors on the boards. (I think
that there are still lots of spare DEC transistors downstairs, if
anybody needs some!) He then got the offices removed, and enforced
strict policies on who could get into the computer room. And there
weren't any more problems.

I have MPEG'd a ten-minute movie made to publicise the opening of the
Computer Centre in 1962, when our GE225 arrived. (That machine is still
fairly intact, in storage, by the way.) If anyone is interested, I'll
make it available.

Slowly, ever so slowly, the full story comes out in dribs and drabs...

Here's an e-mail that I received yesterday from Alan Coulter, the
Director of UQ Computer Centre from 1972-1995.

"Dear Wilber, As you know the initial KA10 system was purchased in 1968
when the Computer Centre was a part of the Department of Electrical
Engineering.

When the newly established position of Director of the Computer Centre
was advertised in May 1972, the advertisement stated that the current
installation comprised a dual-processor PDP10 system with thirty-two
remote terminals.

I commenced at the Computer Centre in November 1972.  I found that the
system had not operated a dual processor system but there was a second
processor stored under covers at the back of the computer room.  Up
until the addition of 64K of memory in Feb 1973 the system only had 48K
of 36 bit memory, so that it would have been difficult to support around
30 terminals and two processors.

Another major problem at that time was that I was informed that the
system was heavily corroded and that this was the reason for high levels
of downtime.  There were two independent investigations in 1971 which
found that high levels of dust and the possibility that the gold plating
on some of the components was defective would have contributed to the
corrosion.  I think that an alleged earlier practice of switching off
the computer and air conditioning system at weekends would not have
helped. This was of major concern to me and indeed in a report to the
Deputy Vice-Chancellor in February 1973 I wrote "I see no percentage at
all in starting off this period with two leprous central processing
units as the heart of our system".  Any way after a programme over a
number of months of scrubbing circuit boards in the Centre's tea room,
drying them with hair dryers, repairing them we eventually achieved
acceptable levels of up-time.

A drama going on at the same time was that I wanted to change to a
standard DEC 5-Series operating system wheras most of the staff of the
Computer Centre wished to continue with the development of a UQ command
system as part of the 4-Series operating system.  I will not go into the
details of this problem but it took a number of months to resolve.

For all of these reasons it is safe to say that the KA did not operate
as a dual processing system in 1973 but in the Feb 1974 issue of the
Centre's General Information Manual it was shown as a planned
development.  I cant find any reports for 1974/75.  Certainly by Feb
1976 the KA was operating as dual processor system with 240K words of
memory and 11 disk drives (480M characters).

Wilber I hope this provides some background for you.  Best wishes Alan"

So, there's another instalment of the story!

The women who worked in the Mill had rules about checking the
toilets before sitting down on them.  Spider bites in the nether
regions was a common hazard.  One did not walk down the
corriders of the Mill with their mouth open unless extra
protein was needed in the diet.  I wonder what an OSHA-ite would
say to that these days?

Sometime around 1972, when I was supporting the KA10
at Sanders Associates, I rewrote the mag tape service
routine.  I sent it to DEC as an SPR, and I think that
is what brought me to the attention of the monitor
gurus.  Looking at the posted excerpt, though, I do not
recognize a single line.  I conclude that the mag tape
service routine was rewritten at least one more time
in in TOPS-10's history.

I am pretty sure that a 1030 was built.  There was a 1030 OS, and it was
once listed in the DECUS library but was gone by the early 1970s.  I've
been trying to get my hands on a copy for the past 28 years.

Found it earlier this month.  The document refers to the PDP-10/10
through PDP-10/50, which is obviously an earlier nomenclature than
DECsystem-1040, but with obvious correspondence.

A 1030 was a 1020 with 16K instead of 8K, and ``additional I/O devices''
beyond the CTY and console PTR/PTP, and a pair of DECtapes.

				 PDP-10

PDP-10 is an expandable, 36-bit computer system available in five
configurations (PDP-10/10, 10/20, 10/30, 10/40, and 10/50) and offering
optimum power and versatility in the medium price range.

The PDP-10 includes an extremely powerful processor with 15 index
registers, 16 accumulators, and 8,192 words of 36-bit core memory, a
300-character-per-second paper tape reader, a 50-character-per-second
paper tape punch, a console teleprinter, and a two-level priority
interrupt subsystem.  PDP-10/20 adds two DECtapes, PDP-10/30 includes
16,384 words of memory and additional I/O devices.  PDP-10/40 adds an
extended order code and a memory protection and relocation feature.  And
PDP-10/50 permits swapping between 32,768 words of memory and fast
access desk file via the multiplexer/selector channel, and includes
multiprogramming time-sharing software.

The PDP-10 is designed for on-line and real-time applications such as
physics and bio-medical research, process control, as a departmental
computation facility, in simulation and aerospace, chemical
instrumentation, display processing and as a science teaching tool.

The software package includes real-time FORTRAN IV, a control monitor, a
macro assembler, a context editor, a symbolic debugging program, an I/O
controller, a peripheral interchange program, a desk calculator and
library programs.  All software systems assure upward compatibility from
the standard 8,192 words of memory through the multi-programming and
swapping systems at both the symbolic and relocatable binary level.

PDP-10 features a 1-microsecond cycle time, a 2.1-microsecond add time,
I/O transfer rates up to 7,200,000 bits per second and a modular, proven
software package that expands to make full use of all hardware
configurations.  Memory can be expanded in 8,192 word increments to the
maximum directly addressable 262,144 words.

Note: the word ``disk'' is misspelled as ``desk'' in ``swapping between
32,768 words of memory and fast access desk file via the multiplexer/
selector channel'' in the handbook itself.

They were wise enough not to list any Computer Catalog entries in the
1-Apr-67 price list.  A -10 wasn't exactly an off-the-shelf item.


Joe, perhaps you would be so kind as to integrate the new facts from the
above into http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/models.txt in your copious free
time?  Perhaps something like:

"
1010    KA10, 8Kwords, papertape, never built.
1020    KA10, 8Kwords, DECtape, never built.
1040    KA10, single user
1050    KA10, multi user
"
	=>
"
1010    KA10, 8Kwords, papertape, never built.
1020    KA10, 8Kwords, 2 DECtapes, never built.
1030    KA10, 16Kwords, 2 DECtapes, never built.
1040    KA10, single user
1050    KA10, multi user
"

(Though I don't know whether or not a 1030 was ever built).  Of course
if you want to say more there, feel free.

The 8i was not a front-end.

It was merely a device that could respond to RIM (Read-In Mode)
which allowed the disk bootstrap program to be loaded from PDP-8 memory
instead of from paper tape.

Traditional boot:
  Set RIM device switches to the code for PTR.
  Put bootstrap tape into the paper tape reader.  The first segment
    on the tape is the RIM10B loader.  The second segment can be either
    a full-fledged BOOTS (a rather long paper tape with code that can
    accept a file name from the TTY and load the specified file from
    disk) or a short pre-boot that simply reads raw bootstrap blocks off
    of a reserved area of disk unit zero.
  Press the Read-In-Mode switch.

Non-paper boot:
  Set RIM device switches to the code for PDP-8 interface.
  The disk pre-boot has already been put into the PDP-8's core memory.
  Press the Read-In-Mode switch.
    1) Short read-the-boot-blocks routine gets sent to the KA with
       the PDP-8 acting like a virtual paper-tape reader.
    2) Said routine locates logical disk 0, reads in the first part
       of the disk bootstrap, executes it (which reads in the rest of
       the full disk bootstrap code).

This method simply saved wear-and-tear on the KA's paper tape reader.

The KA in our lab (known as the Doomsday Lab) did not have fast ACs.
I specifically asked the Field Service guy who was working on it about
that one day.

Of course, your statement might still be correct, as the KA was serial
number 1, and, technically, never sold.

Ah....

I was told that although UWA ordered their 6 without FM, it was
fitted. Time and the like have eaten if they had to pay for it or if
it was a freebie. Seems that at that point, DEC had never run without
FM, and in theory it should all `just work'...

This was later expanded with a comment that DEC never sold a 36 bit CPU
without FM.

John Sauter responded:

The fast memory on the PDP-6 was a separate bay, the 162.
Simply leaving it out of the memory bus cabling should
remove the fast memory from a PDP-6, so I believe that
the PDP-6 could have been sold without fast memory.

I can imagine reasons that they might have been reluctant to sell a
machine without FM, since all the others they sold had it.  However,
I doubt that it was due to inexperience in running a system without
FM.  It was standard practice if the FM went bad to run the machine
with the FM Enable switch turned off until FS repaired it.

I was astounded to discover that the FM in the KA10 is implemented
using integrated circuits!  I'm pretty sure this was NOT the case for
the PDP-6 FM.

Once more with feeling, "Yeah, it's the F M alright!" 

`t was know as `The Harp' I'm told, as it had a set of conections
soldered onto the non-socket side of the modules. So getting them
out was the pits.

The Digital Eqipment PDP10 KA has an asynchronous CPU. The later KI, KL, and KS 
models have synchronous CPUs.
