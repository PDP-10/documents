At HP they installed a KL10, and started testing it.
My manager put his hand on the cabinet & nearly burned himself.
He told the CE who said "Oh, it's ECL, it gets hot."

That was before they found out the fans weren't connected.
And either was the overtemp sensor.
We got new boards, too.

	At the USBR, we found that the RP07's had a MTBF of about 18 months. 
If one lasted 19 months, I started getting twitchy and planning for a
six hour downtime to replace and restore.  But, damn, they wre fast!

	On the subject of tape drives, and my previous comments about the
TU-45, I have two "war stories" to relate:

1)	When I was at DEC, we had a messed up 2400' tape.  I don't know what
was wrong with it, but if you brought that tape online with MOUNTR, the
TM03 would lockup and crash the system.  So, whenever someone new joined
the group, we initiated them.  As part of their training, we sent them
downstairs with that tape and told them to put it online, then mount it,
and give us a call when they had done this.  Then we waited.  About five
minutes later, we'd get a call: "I put the tape up, like you said, but
something's wrong..."  Whoever was the mentor would yell into the
phone:  "What the Hell did you do?  I'm coming down there!"  The poor
witless newbie would wait in terror for the mentor to come in the front
door of the computer room, while the rest of us snuck in through the
back door to observe.  After a few minutes of being on the hot seat,
we'd all emerge, cracking up, and explain to the newbie the situation. 
Most of them took it well, especially when we told them that the first
round was on us.  Cruel?  Maybe, but we always used it as an object
lession as what to expect if they accidently crashed a system at a
customer site.

2)	We had a customer with a very large installed base of -10's.  They
also had a large base of VAXes.  Problem: transferring files back and
forth.  This was before DECnet-10 was really there.  Solution:
magtapes.  There was a little hack program called 11TAPE, for
transferring files between PDP-10's and PDP-11's.  The problem was that
it was not very robust, could not handle multiple files in one
operation, etc.  So I set out to rewrite it.  Rewrite it I did.  Among
other things, I interfaced it with SCAN and WILD.  About the only pieces
of code left from the original were the RAD50 encode/decode routines. 
But I needed to make it handle tape errors in a reasonable fashion.  So
I took an old scratch tape and damaged it.  I took a refrigator magnet
and rubbed it all over the tape.  I crumpled it.  I took my pocket knife
and slashed it.  I even took it outside on the sidewalk and ground it
with my boot.  Wouldn't you know it?  I COULD NOT get that tape to give
me an error condition on that TU45!  Of course, if it had been an
important tape, I'd have trouble reading it...  As it was, when I was
writing a tape with BACKUP or DUMPER, I'd specify redundancy.  Likewise,
if I was writing a tape elsewhere that I was going to have to read on
that drive.

	Oh, man, you just ain't whistlin' Dixie!  I LOVED those drives.  I even
got them running on a KA-10 once at a DEC customer site.  But they ate
the bus so much, that about the only time you could run time was after
hours, and expect same day service from timesharing.

	I also had to "fix" the drivers for the Systems Concepts version of the
TU70's with the SA-10 controller for 7.01/7.02.  I ran into an unusual
problem, which it took months to track down, mainly because the crash
dumps that yielded useful information were few and far between, and
unless I was right there, the operations manager was prone to delete
them before I could look at them.

	Anyway, once we upgraded the 1099 to 4 megs of memory, the system would
crash during timesharing if the tape drives were used.  Not immediately,
but eventually.  I was finally able to divine the fact that despite the
documentation to the contrary, the SA-10 only used 20 bits for
addressing.  If the buffer was near the top of the first meg and needed
to access memory above 1 meg, the buffer wrapped around to low core
instead of extending into the second meg!  Nasty!

	While we're on the subject of old disks, I remember a particularly
nasty head crash at my old college involving an RP01 or RP02.  I forget
which nowadays.  Anyway, if you've ever seen the movie "The Wrath of
Kahn", when the Enterprise finally gets a shot off at the bridge of the
Reliant?  That's how the top of the drive looked - there was glass and
aluminum shards all over the computer room, some of them embedded in the 
wall!  If some poor soul had been in the computer room at that time,
they would have been seriously injured, perhaps killed!

	I was a resident at a customer site for many months.  They had several
of the beasts.  At one time, they were going to have an open house, so
that the friends and families of the employees could see the site.  The
computer room was added to the attractions.

	The system manager mused that they should put price tags on all of the
equipment, so that if anyone fat-fingered something and broke it, they
would know how much they owed.  He started down the list: "DEC-20, $
250,000; RP06, $ 30,000...
TU-45, fifty cents..."

	Then he made the observation about throwing them in the bay for use as
boat anchors, except:  "... they'd probably float.  All $#!? floats..."

Then there were those dancing disks, disks which would creep across
the floor on their own slowly due to the way they'd pitch and
yaw. Every once in a great while one would unplug itself or so the
stories went. I do remember rescuing an RP06, I think it was, which
had pulled its data cable tight as a piano string. Really gave you a
"now how in the hell could this have happened?", ready to give someone
an earful, until you figured out what it was up to and that it had
done that to itself.

Oh, yes, I understand that sentiment.  Once upon a time there was a new

CUSPs.  About a year later, he let it be known that he deserved a raise and 
a promotion such that he would be equivalent to JMF.  When he finally left,

complained of a feature not being available anymore.  I investigated the

this upstart.   Since the CUSP in question was a very important piece in 
the successful running of operations, I looked at the other edits he did.  
They all had to be deleted, the old SPRs reopened, and the real bugs got

The way I worked was I would take a terminal, mount a pack, type ONE 
<ctrl>C, do a bunch of type-ahead, go out to the machine room, mount the 
pack, find another terminal, start another process. Before I get 
implmentation suggestions, these tasks were not repetitive, just part of 
doing the many varied tasks that I associate with being a den mother 
[smiling emoticon here].

What this developer did was take out the pause that UMOUNT did.  If you 
typed  
MOUNT BLKX<CR> 
^C
DIR FOO<CR>
UMOUNT would trap the <CTRL>C until the pack was mounted.  The edit done 
was to immediately go to monitor mode whenever any <CTRL>C was typed.  So I 
couldn't type ahead, run into the machine room to mount the pack and have 
my tasks (as TW would say) "start without me".

	I'm sure that we all have our favorite RUNOFF story.  Mine was as 
follows:  I had to do an in-depth analysis of a customer's performance
problems.  (Hey, what did they expect - they were running a KA-10)  In
fact, I got "imported" to Colorado to do it.  Much of it was data
collection
via WATCH.  I was able to distill it down using some utilities that Reed
Powell had written.   The problem was how to get it into a readable form
for the customer.

	Solution: I modified the output routines to output the data with 
RUNOFF commands interspersed.  Then I ran the data through RUNOFF and
came out with page after pretty page of statistics.  When printed on
a Diablo daisy wheel printer with the carbon ribbon, it really looked
sharp.  This was (I'm pretty sure) before the time of laser printers,
but the Diablo output was very nice.  (Until a sales being put his
leaking
pastrami sandwich on top of the stack of output.  How I got revenge
is a story for another time...)

	I still use RUNOFF to this day, to help create VMS documentation.
Truly a great piece of software.  (If that's not enough, people watch
with
awe when I use TECO...)

While I was at C-MU, we got a "Xerox Graphics Printer" not quite a laser
printer, it used a bright CRT to draw a scanline which got focused onto
the photodrum, coated with toner, and transferred to paper.  It was about
5 feet tall, three feet deep, and used a roll of paper 2 feet in diameter.
That was around 1973.  On a job interview trip to Xerox PARC a year or
two later I saw a prototype laser printer, even bigger than the XGP.

I think I used a Diablo printer at DEC by 1978.  I left that year for
a small company that produced the first letter quality dot matrix printer.
Competition was Diablo, Qume, etc, there were no laser printers, at
least not in the sub $30K range.

  The DEC field service people at the time (a rich source of rumors
on many many subjects) told me that the Jupiter prototype had design 
problems that would prevent it from running unless the speed of
light could be increased by a factor of 3.

  I dunno if it's credible, given that the same techs told me that
they had personally witnessed the "always mount a scratch monkey"
event, and they also related a complicated tale involving a
PDP-11/70 hardware virus that was so persistent, if a machine
caught it,the only way to get rid of it was to throw away the
memory cores involved.

From what I can see DEC had to murder the PDP-10 and it's OS's. It did 
not die a natural death in customer hands. It's performance and more
so its operating system functionality had not been over taken in reality
let alone mind set of its users. Even to day you can still look at 
TOPS-20 and humble current operating systems. I know that this has been
getting less and less true but considering developments stopped for TOPS
largely in 1983 (depending upon your perspective earlier or later) and
went it to maintenace mode. The reluctance from customers is quite 
reasonable, they had large investment in systems that worked! ever
heard the expression "don't fix it if it's not broken" and VAX and VMS
looked a lot wet behind the eares it was not yet ready to take over
the roll of a PDP-10. The VAX also belonged to those rather small
16-bit people was also part of the mind set.
	VAX and VMS really was a 32bit version of PDP-11 and RSX-11
which belonged to a large and growing market segment for DEC (which
was running out of puff with address bits at it upper end), LCG systems
made more revenue per system than PDP-11 but the  total revenue from
PDP-11 looked a whole lot more promissing in the cake than LCG. VAX was
for this market and they I expect hoped that it would get big enough
by 1993 that they could slowly migrate most of the customer base.
I guess that many customers felt a little bit pss't off and took
the need to migrate as a chance to get away from broken promisses
the grass always looks greener.
	One rumor was that the last new PDP-10 system DECSYSTEM-2020
(looked like an 8500 cab only orange trim) which could have been put
to market for less than 50k went out for 100k + so as to be more 
expensive rather than less compared with VAX.
	LCG just did not understand that they needed to cover a larger
market they had the opportunity to provide a personal version of PDP-10
TOAD (Ten On A Desk) but dropped it. The DECSYSTEM-2020 was a step to 
this but too late those grubby RSX fokes had won the day in the minds
of the bean counters which spells certian death for a product of this
nature. PDP-10 became a doomed ship and the failure of the Jupiter
to provide the promissed performance gains (KL10-B x 10) was just the
bullet to load and fire the gun. I don't know if lack or resources
resulted it them missing the performance goal but they missed it by
enough to get axed. I do not believe in any of the rumors blaming the
staff as not understanding the problems and behaviour of a PDP-10
I think the task was too big with what they had and that the promisses
made to high. 
	Re the 8600 and Jupiter the guy that did not microcode for
PDP-10's was moved to VAX microcode don't know the exact timing or
history behind that move but I don't think it was a good sign for
PDP-10. I think DEC was working on the idea that they could build one
piece of hardware and microcode it as either VAX or PDP-10. Time
to market and over run on this project was delt with by removing the
PDP-10 requirement and VAX8600 was delivered to market. Such was
a joke made at DECUS that the 4bit FCO/ECO would be available soon
for 8600. ( I think I have that story correct)

As it was it was the right thing for DEC, it just was not implemented
that well. I think they should have kept going with PDP-10 even 
delivered Jupiter it was not as fast as promissed but was faster and
allow customers to make a choice. Two things prevented this I think :-
1) Customers would not make a choice (long live LCG)
2) MONEY$$$ DEC I think was short on resources both people and $$$
	Solution get all every one behind one arrow and shoot straight
	for the money. It worked, just made a few people unhappy.

With all the stories re: death of the PDP-10, I have to wonder how much was
programmer/designer culture and what was in during a given year/mindset.

When hardware costs drove things, the apparent, or at least claimed software,
and for that matter hardware advantages of setting the word length at a power
of 2 was ignored - add four bits and a 12-bit machine becomes the minimum
workable mini, 8 is too small to be taken seriously, and for mini users, 16 is
far too expensive. Add two to the basic 16-bit midi and you have something
hotter, but not that many more transistors.

Same with 24 (planned by DEC to the point they reserved a number for it. as a
midi+ machine, the PDP-2, a word length used by other companies)

But others went with the Power of 2 machines and, it would seem, made a big
deal out of the "advantages" of 16/32/64 and hexidecimal vs. octal. When the
price of transistors fell and software became the most expensive part of a
computer...

	I did an extensive series of benchmarks of the KL vrs. the 780 before 
I left DEC: those results were censored by management.  The best the 780
could
do was about 77% of a KL.  The KL even stomped the 780 worse in the

We had one at Boston U.

I don't believe it was obtained through regular product channels,
probably someone in ACIS (IBM's academic relations division) got it
for us. I'm pretty sure what you say is basically true, it certainly
wasn't common.

Before I discovered the True Religion (TM) of 36-bit systems, I spent a *lot*
of time on the 360/370 architecture.  The 360 was always EBCDIC, with its 8-bit
bytes.

The reason that USASCII-8 was removed with the introduction of the 370 line was
that ANSI never adopted IBM's suggestion for what an 8-bit extension of ASCII
should look like:  The additional bit was *not* the high-order bit, but bit 5,
so that the character table had two full columns, two empty ones, two full, two
empty, ... out to 256 bytes worth.  Adoption of this scheme by ANSI would have
insured IBM's monopoly while other manufacturers revised their hardware to
support it.

Bit 12 of the PSW selected this mode in the 360, and did indeed change the sign
nybble in the PACK and UNPK instructions (from C = positive and D = negative to
A = positive and B = negative).

   Aw, Frank! Now you've got me all misty-eyed with nostalgia. I
suppose that the smell of a hot Teletype for a programmer must
rival the smell of hot oil and steam to a rail enthusiast.

   These days, all anyone speaks of concerning computers is the
"touch and feel" of them; thanks for bringing a more visceral
sense into the equation!

Chuckle! I had forgotten.  I don't remember the date he left.  I do 
remember that I threw a marvelous bash to send him on his way; we all 
needed it to counter the sadness we felt.

Story time!

When TW told us (JMF and me) that he was leaving for Wang, I told him that 
DEC stock would drop dramatically when he left.  Of course, TW didn't 
believe me, so we bet a pound of lox.  When he left DEC, sure enough, the 
stock dropped.  TW still claimed that the drop had nothing to do with his 
leaving.  I countered with the arguement, "Then why did Wang's stock go 
up?"  I got my pound of lox the next day.  JMF really enjoyed that lox.

Okay, here's one:

When I first started at DEC our office was on the first floor of Building 12. 
At least I think that's the building number, it was at the front of the mill 
complex and KO's office was in the northwest corner. Our office was at the 
rear of the building, hidden behind the PDP-6. At that time DEC didn't own 
the mill, it just leased space. In addition to DEC there were lots of small 
businesses like injection molding companies, garage door factories, etc., and 
some large tenants. One of them, either American Can or Dennison had just 
moved out, freeing up major space which DEC was taking over. Four or five of 
us, TW included, decided to mount an expedition to explore the newly vacated 
space. After wandering through the previously uncharted territory in 
buildings 5 and 1 (and perhaps others), we returned to our office, which 
afforded us a view between buildings up the hill toward building 5. As we 
stood at the window, reflecting upon the vast unused space we had just 
discovered, Tony declared, "Isn't this great? We'll never outgrow this 
place!"

Another story....

Tony had returned from a visit to Oslo, Norway (I don't remember what he 
did there...it was probably a combination of on-sites and a DECUS).  He had 
learned that "toc" was their way of saying thank you even though it sort of 
translated into a "here it is...there it goes".  

Not long after his return, I got him a cup of coffee (remember the HW10?). 
 When I had desposited the cup into his hands, he said "Toc".  Without a 
bat of an eye, I replied, "Tick".  

This tickled him so much (and TW could get really, really tickled) that it 
became a tradition for him to say toc to me.  This also touched JMF's funny 
bone.  There were a lot of toc...ticks for a long time causing much 
giggling and very strange looks from on-lookers who hadn't a clue to the 
joke.  Of course, explaining the joke caused even more strange looks 
[grinning emoticon here].

One of the things he did was visit with Mauritz Fredericksen, another office 
mate of ours when TW and I first joined DEC in 1966. Maury worked on the 
original PDP-6/10 Batch system. He was a native Norwegian who was sent to 
Oslo by DEC in 1969 or 1970 (along with Eric Ericsen) to start DEC Norway. He 
never returned to the US. I recall TW reported that Maury, who came to the US 
when he was thirteen and spoke unaccented American English, had developed an 
accent. JMF knew Maury quite well; I'm not sure whether BAH would remember 
him.

The definition I learned (round '79) was that a minicomputer
was one which had an entry cost for a well-configured system
between $10k and $100k. Anything more expensive was a mainframe,
less expensive was a micro or PC.

Back before microprocessors were powerful enough, it used to go:

	CPU on 1 or 2 chips:	Micro.
	CPU on 1 or 2 cards:	Mini.
	CPU in 1 or 2 racks:	Mainframe.

I think you really have to look at the history of the instruction set these
days to categorize things. If it's from IBM it's a mainframe, if it's from
DEC it's a mini, otherwise it's a micro.

That was another good one! [laughing emoticon here].  The only thing worse 
than a TU78 was a TU45.  Wilst the TU78 slyly crept the tape forward so 
that the unsuspecting software wouldn't know its place on the tape, the 
TU45 wouldn't even allow a tape to be loaded and generate that on-line 
interrupt.

Actually, the TU45 was the worst piece of !@#^U% that DEC ever passed off
as a tape drive since the original TU10.

I once had two catch fire as I was doing the alignments and servo
adjustments... Sup and Sus and Tup and Tus are burned into my brain from
that awful Pertec beast.

The TU78's tape creep was easy to fix if the tech would have just done the 
alignments cleanly.  The TU78's big problem was most techs didn't take the
training course for the TU77 or TU78 and didn't understand the transport
adjustments.

The advantage of mainframes was (and is) in searching and managing
huge databases, terabyte databases are not uncommon.

Obviously if one's computing needs tends more towards interactive
activities rather than something like getting out Citibank's probably
20 million (I dunno, "many millions") monthly statements one doesn't
see the sense in such machines.

It's like complaining that an 18-wheel semi is a pain in the butt to
park and makes a lousy passenger car. Pointing out that there are many
more passenger cars than semis (therefore semis suck, the market has
decided!) doesn't quite make the point.

What was stupid was this sort of religious zeal which kept smallish
versions of such mainframes in universities for academic (not
administrative, that made more sense) use long after it made any sense
to do so. Hell, some universities still maintain multi-million-dollar
mainframes for student time-sharing only because no one can pry out
their well-bunkered staff and management.

Anyhow, I basically agree with you, but you're probably remembering
some (past, common) situation where they were shoving a mainframe down
your throat. That practice has practically made "ibm" rhyme with "ugh"
among a whole generation.

 There was a clone drive that I once used, which had the most *****
awful load/unload mechanism. I set it going  doing a long backup, and
popped out to deliver something. When I got back the lab was full of
greyish smoke... oh dear.

 What had happened was as follows. It had a hub lock/unlock mechanism
which involved a big solonoid to lock one half of the hub, while the
motor did a single revolution against the other half, either expanding
the rubber ring to grab the reel, or collapsing it to release it. What
had happened was that the silly thing had pulled in just as it was
finishing a rewind, and the motor had gone to full power against a
locked hub. When I got back you could have fried bacon on the motor,
and the heatsink with the big power transistors was hot enough to have
damaged most of them, and done for one of the voltage regulators as
well.

 Amazingly the write lock ring had foamed up, and turned into sort of
yellow sponge, which had lifted the reel off the hub, and protected the
tape from most of the heat. It also made an interesting pattern on my
shirt when I pulled the reel off...

 The tape survived.

Anyone else want to share war stories regarding the Field Service Engineers?

In regards to the KL-1091, back when it was new:

> in May 1980.  It was shipped with TOPS-10 7.01 MOS LIR (limited interim
> release; Can you say buggy?) 

Yep.  The shipment of our machine was delayed due to them having to make
last-minute updates to TGHA to properly configure the MOS memory.

War story: One day a 2060 in Denver was not working.  FS thought it might
be one of the small coaxial cables.  "Gee, all the KL's have an unused
coax on the MBOX.  Why don't we borrow one each from 5 different CPUs
and see if that fixes the problem?"  A flunky was dispatched to CSM in
the middle of the night, pulled the wire, and payed no attention to the
message NO MEMORY AT LOCATION 0 on the console.  The next day, our FE
(who was unaware of the midnight visit) determined that the clock pulses were
not getting to the internal memory box, made a coax substitute by twisting a
pair of wires with aligator clips, and got the machine running.  The wire
in question was unused on all the 2060's at the time (and 1090's), but
our CPU was the only one in Colorado with internal memory.

The TU78 and TU77 were crap - we called them Mattel tape drives - as in
toys. The TU70/2 were STC made drives and were far more reliable. They
could also read tapes that the TU78s thought were garbage. Joe Morris
is absolutely correct what he states below. It's odd now that I think
of it when I was at UTCC (same time as Joe) why we didn't just use IBM
3420s connected to the DX10 into the KLs.

Also, later working for Digital, I had to go on site to UWV where they
had IBM systems sharing the same STC drives with VAX 8650's. (Also
at the time another UTCC alumni, Jerry Bryant, was head of the computer
center there). The 8650's used DX20's connected to their MASSBUS to
connect to the tape drive. Switches on the tape controller for each unit
selected the port (VAX/IBM). It was also good software etiquette(?) to 
"vary" the tape unit offline on the IBM side when being used on the VAX
and vis versa.

Another real advantage of an on-site person was that they learned
the individual machines failure modes, and we able to deal with them
quick-and-easy without a lot of debugging.  At NRL, the KI10 systems
all had their own personalities, and they failed in "trends" that were
unique to each machine, or so I was told by Larry "the Junkman"

No list of Field Circus horror stories would be complete without a
couple examples of user-inflicted horror stories.

1. On-call FS engineer gets call late at night, talks customer through
toggling in PDP8 RIM loader twice before he realizes machine key is set
to "panel lock".

2. Customer has multiple computers, puts one on maintainance contract. 
When the others fail, he board-swaps until he finds the bad component
then puts it in maintainance contract machine and puts in a service call
to have it fixed.  

3. Customer installs expensive ferroresonant Sola power conditioner, it
interacts with processor ferroresonant power supply causing weekly
failures.

I have quite a few about field service.  Most of the guys I encountered
were good (one in the local office was really exceptional) but one guy was
forever doing silly things.  It got so bad that I used to watch him when
he worked on the machines.  Anyway, one day he was doing PM on one of our
two 2060's  The machines in question were both in the same machine room
but the consoles and disk drives associated with each machine were clearly
marked.  He put the KLAD pack into the machine and walked over to the FE
of the other machine and hit the floppy boot.  He tried this _serveral_
times.   Good thing that TOPS20 didn't get wildly upset.  It kept
reloading the normal FE software when the 11/40 went offline.  Of course,
it kept disconnecting our 100+ users but at least the batch processing
wasn't disturbed (this was our admin machine and all financial processing
was going on in batch).   After a couple of minutes observing this
performance I quietly asked him which machine was being serviced.  He did
a double take and finally started working on the right machine.

Just to be symetric..  He did the opposite thing on a later PM.  He put
the KLAD into the wrong machine and tried to boot the other one.  Again,
TOPS20 was pretty robust.  We did however lose the batch subsystem that
time.  QUASAR went nutz when it couldn't write its log files.

One good thing about this.  I found out that TOPS20 (rev 5.x at least)
could handle disk packs getting moved with the system running and no
commands from the operator.  I used to like to give our IBM system's guys
a cheap thrill by swapping the lap plugs on the RP06's (not the one with
FE software) and the machine would recover with barely a burp.   I was
curious and looked thru the monitr for the code and found that the cyclic
code that checked the home blocks would also patch the chan/unit addresses
if you swapped things around.  Best of all.. The open file status was
unchanged by all of this sillyness.

I really miss TOPS20.  I did system's work on those two 20's for about 8
years.  The hardware was a bit buggy but the software concepts really were
ahead of their time.  I enjoy unix but for different reasons.

	At least those stories had happy endings.  I thought at first
you were going to relate that Field Service wiped and formatted the 
packs on the wrong system, because they didn't "respond".  I've seen 
that happen.  Funny how Field Service always expects the customer to
have an up-to-the-minute backup.

	But, one of my specialities was going out and cleaning up after 
similar disasters, assuming that the packs weren't too corrupted, and  
attempt to retreive the data, if possible.

	I wonder if that was just a fortunate accident of design, or 
whether it was planned.  Things happened fairly quickly in Marlboro.
Although the development machines might stay up for months, once they
got a stable load of the OS, on the test machines things went up and
down.  It's not suprising that the system would/could track a swapped 
pack.

	Talking about things happening rapidly in Marlboro, I remember 
one Monday morning, Roland Belanger, the maintainer of RSX-20F, came 
in, and his development and test machine was gone.  Physically removed. 
It had been there on Friday afternoon when he had left.  He went a
little,

	Oh, I've known KL's (and KS's, for that matter) to be extremely 
stable on the long term.  And one thing I'll say about unix - it keeps

Actually, I remember that. My recollection was that the above response
was to a beta-test report (I don't recollect the acronym). You sent
it back in (with reply) as an SPR, which came through Mr. Eklund, and
all hell broke loose.

The person who wrote the above comment currently works down the hall from
me . . .

If I recall correctly, the issue was either path-logical names, or
ersatz devices with sub-directories (e.g., WLD:[,,foo]). Correct?

He would occasionally show up in the early morning hours.  I have fond 
memories of going to breakfast with JMF and A-Z and just listening to those 
two talk.  There was always lots of banter interspersed with really 
good discussions about work.  Having A-Z around was special to Jim and a 
highlight to his day.

I know who you're talking about.  In my book, John A-to-Z is a very good
guy.  He even still works for Digital!  (and I even spelled his name
almost right while doing an employee search for him :-)

Back in a previous Lifetime, when I was doing Field Circus (which
lasted until they told me I didn't need a Oscilloscope to fix
things...), I was working in the far north of Australia, where it gets
very hot and humid. A new boss arrived from south, and insisted we all
start wearing ties. So I went to the throw out bin at the local second
hand clothes store, and found a six inch wide tie. Cleaned it,
cleached it, then carefully draped it around an LP05 drum, and them
let the ink dry.  He took my point and conceded on the ties...

Same area was prone to flooding. I had a photo of a fellow Engineer
wading through waist deep water to fix something. Then there was the
time that I had to climb down into the false flooring to untangle some
cables. Operator Came in and replaced the tile that someone had left
loose. So I crawled over near the desk she was sitting at, raised a
tile and grabbed her ankle. (You can imagine the reaction...)

Another time I recall going to a food supply warehouse to fix an LA120
(Hey we handled everything from PDP8's through to KL's, terminal,
disks, the lot...) I opened the back door, and there were two large
RATS staring at me. Back to the Customers Office, and explain to them
that they (not I) had something to fix....

Then there was the time, that they local electricity supply authority
had a truck run into a power line, shorting part of their power grid.
It just happened to be the part of the grid that housed the power
control stuff. No Problem, it had backup batteries...... Which hadn't
been tested for several years 48V drops to 3V in about 3 seconds...
The Grid goes haywire, but the only system to sustain any real damage
was the "Head Office" of that Electricity Supply Company. Their RM03
system disk, blew both a servo head, and the velocity transducer (a
ferrite rod running down the centre of the Voice Coil. So, it didn't
know where it was, or how fast it was going to get there, so the heads
started slamming in and out, right past the "gone too far"
microswitch, and into the metal stops at the end of its track. About
3-4 minutes of this, and the metal stop bends, and the drive proceeds
to self destruct. The drive had to be Rebuilt because the insurers
insisted on it. It ended up costing only a few hundred dollars shy of
the cost of a replacement drive....

	No, that doesn't look right, but I recall the program that you 
are speaking about.  But I thought the conversion was due to the
migration 
to KL paging, and/or the changed JOBDAT area???

	As I recall the history, in the early days, there was no standard 
parser - everyone wrote their own.  As time went on, and more programs 
were developed, people tended to take portions of their earlier code and 
use in in the new programs, hacking it suitably along the way.  Thus,
eventually, SCAN and WILD became sort of defacto standards within DEC, 
even though they were never formally supported until late in their life
span.

	I would accept that as a truism: a rite of passage to advanced
programming.  I'd rate it as more difficult than doing a run of the mill 
(no pun intended...) Monitor or DAEMON patch, but not quite as difficult
as screwing around with the source code for the Cobol compile, LIBOL or

Well, KA's were heavy, but they weren't very rigid and nothing held the
cards in.  So a good shaking would make the cards fall out.  I watched a
couple of over enthusiastic movers do this once.  Of course once we got
the cards back in the right places it worked fine.

Can't top that, but FS *did* notice when we were planning to put in a pair of
KL10E systems in two rows of cabinets, one behind the other, and observed that
the hot air coming out of system A would be aimed right at the intakes on
system B.  They suggested turning system B around so the machines sat
back-to-back.  It was done, and those machines held up well even when the air
conditioning acted up (which it did regularly )-: .

Well do I remember the huge power supplies that fed the hungry ECL boards on
those machines.  We had one replaced once, and I recall the big WARNINGs,
complete with yellow/black striped border, warning of PERSONAL INJURY if proper
lifting tackle wasn't used.

(OTOH I also remember when XCON configured us a VAX 8800 with a power
receptacle for the 8600, which had a completely different plug on it.  I caught
that one before it shipped....)

	Quite true.  When your name in on the source code, and people 
can buttonhole you at DECUS, you'd better be able to walk the walk and 
talk the talk.

	Those men were gods in the programming world.  On the other hand,
could they program in COBOL?  (does it matter?)  I could only, maybe on 
a good day, function at a fraction of their level, although I have done 
some pretty (gruesome) monitor code of my own.  Sadly to say, and I
hope that this does not sound too arrogant, but most of my coworkers
could only function at a fraction of MY level.  Yet I could not (did
not...) do DBMS or other "mundane" things.  I would be asked "How can I
optimize this database?"  I'd answer: "Define a BIG clustersize (like
20 blocks/cluster on an RP07 on TOPS10) and block your records as
tight as you can within that block".  (I guess that makes me a bottom
up programmer - I'd look at things from the system level up?)

	Alas, I fear that those little tricks would be lost on most
people.  They just want the job done, they don't care about the

	Amen to that.  Computer science is a fairly young discipline, as 
far as the arts and sciences go.  I think that we owe it to future
generations to document our experiences.

Sounds like what we used to do at college (WPI) back in the 70's
when people said that the text went by on their screen too fast...

	"Just set your terminal in slow mode... Do this, type
	'SET TT SLOW'"

which of course, actually slaved their terminals...

And as for twinky, I remember using that system on occasion when
I was an operator (3rd shift) at PKO1.

Actually, it was for node CUPCAK(E), TWINKY came later.

But there is one classic that snuck through.  It is found on page 5-15 of
the July 1980 version of the DECsystem-10/DECSYSTEM-20 Processor Reference
Manual, in the last two paragraphs of section 5.3 "KI Processor Conditions".

	DATAO APR,	Maintenance Data Out, Arithmetic Processor

   The margin value specified by bits 30-35 of the output word is
translated to a voltage in the range 0-10 volts by a D-A converter,
whose output is available at pin 2S02V2.  Running margins requires a
slowdown capacitor in the converter.  But turning of the margin enable
switch cuts out the capacitor, making the converter output suitable for
external use, such as for operating audio equipment to play Bach or
rock or Bacharach.

 One of the local electronic chains (Radar Electric) recently
opened an outlet for very obsolete items called "Electronic Excess".

 Amid the RA60's, Vax-11/785's, tape drives and such was an RM-05 which
looked in good shape. The local KS-10 owners took a pass.

 I have no connection to the place (aside from being an occasional
customer) but do enjoy PDP-10's. Since the RM-05 is one of the few drives
that will work on a KS-10 without installing 3-phase, I thought someone
here might be looking for one.

	For fun, while doing console debugging on TOPS20, we used to
drop into EDDT and change the startup message, that was sent to all 
hardwired terminals:

"System restarting, wait..."

	to:

"System is farting, wait..."

Yep. I snipped the PDP-1 pictures and taped them to my filing cabinet,

Huh. I guess that was too early. There's a persistent rumor that certain
instructions in the Cray were required by No Such Agency, and one of those
was "find first one". It made sense for them to be doing the same thing
to the -10, but my flash of inspiration was obviously wrong.

I still remember patching a live system when I was bored one afternoon.  I
wont' describe the system but we used to call it a 'LBT'  And the B stands
for blue.  Anyway, and friend and I found in the system listings that the
prompt for the command interpreter was in non-paged memory.  One thing lead
to another and we modified the kernal prompt from 'OK' to 'Yo'  Since we
did this on a public system (with about 100 students and misc faculty, etc
logged in), the phone ran pretty quickly -- grin.  Working on a LBT was
pretty rude after doing TOPS20 system work for 8 years.

I recall sometime around 1970 Steve Mikulski (PDP-10 Marketing) told me

   The simulator in question here is Ken Harrenstein's (sp?). From
what I've heard, it's quite the piece of work capable, even, of
using the host's networking harware to do DECnet. Bob grumbles
about it not being released as much as the next guy.

  Doing an APR (Arithmetic PRocessor, as the CPU was known) would
be the easy part - it's the I/O that'll drive the simulator writer
insane, especially if it's "true-to-form". I've thought of doing one,
but backed away from the task head bowed.

   Well, it _was_ fun and challenging, but as ADP strove to maintain
a 99.5% up-time record during "prime time" staring at a -10 wedged
between time-states didn't make the bosses too happy. Needless to say,
the thing only crashed during the prime hours (on a single customer's
job, IIRC) there was little else to do other than to bite the proverbial
bullet and troubleshoot "live".

   I can imagine using the JFFO for some custom-built I/O controllers
if the error bits are laid out intelligently. Do a JFFO on the status
word and use the result as a jump vector. No, I've never coded one
either, except for debugging.

This was a topic of discussion 'way back when. I vaguely recall finding
a legit use of JFFO once to evaluate a bitmap. And someone told an
anecdote of someone else using a JFFO 17, in order to jump to an address
with register 0 clear, thus saving the instruction necessary to clear
it...this worked, of course, because the stack pointer in 17 always had
the high bit set.

Not just the core dumps, though.  It also was invoked upon every LOGIN and
KJOB. That's what the .FACT function code does -- write an entry into the
FACT files, where the accounting information was stored. In fact, if the
system was busy enough, and DAEMON was either busy with something else, or
was swapped out and not coming back for awhile, a Control-T might show your
job to be in JD state -- awaiting action by the DAEMON.

When I was in college, we had a KI-10 with 512KW of memory, running a
locally-hacked (what else is new?) version of 6.03. During end-of-semester
crunch time, there would be 83 users logged in to a system with a JOBMAX of
90, most of those 83 being either students running COBOL compiles
incessantly (it was a business school) or school admin types running the
production software that ran the school's business.  At those times, a KJOB
could take upwards of 10 minutes to complete, because of the huge scarcity
of run time and memory.


[Minor OS-nit-pick mode enabled: One thing I always noted about TOPS-10,
even towards the end, was that LOGIN and (especially) KJOB took
considerable time to execute, especially compared to VMS. On VMS, do a
STOP/ID=0 or a logout, or any of the other myriad ways you could kill your
process, and the response was immediate, even on moderately-loaded systems.
On TOPS-10, however, there was a significant pause while KJOB evaluated
your disk usage and decided whether or not to do a full disk usage
recomputation.]

In a school lab environment, you often had situations where one minute 40
students would be trying to get their COBOL homework completed at the last
minute before class, and the next minute there were 40 empty terminals with


                ^C^C
                .K/F

on the screen.

Most of them were probably running either the COBOL compiler, the linker,
or their buggy programs at the time they bailed out. Many were swapped out
because of the huge shortage of memory.

And now they ALL needed to be in core so the Monitor could clear their core
allocation and bring in KJOB. Coupled with KJOB's needing a significant
fraction of a second of run time (and several disk I/Os) to check disk
usage, and DAEMON's having to wake up and write a FACT.SYS entry (which was
NOT asynchronous -- the calling job was blocked until DAEMON was done),
those 40 terminals might take upwards of 20 minutes to finally complete
logging out!


It was all rather frustrating then as a school computer lab assistant
trying to understand why the KJOB took forever (the explanation above only
became apparent after I went to DEC, read the sources, and picked people's
brains).  Now it's just an interesting reminisence...
