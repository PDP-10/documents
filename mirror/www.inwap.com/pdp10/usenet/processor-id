Yes.  It's called the "DECsystem-10/DECSYSTEM-20 Processor Reference
Manual", page 2-112 of the July 1980 edition, under the section
"Programming Examples".

The BLT behavior is explictly documented on page 2-8 and E-2.

Note that the comment in MACTEN.MAC is not true:
;       NOTE THERE IS NO WAY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN KL-10 AND KS-10 CPU'S
The distinction is based on a documented bug in the KL microcode.

2.15 Programming Examples

Before continuing to more system-related subjects, let us consider some
simple programs that demonstrate the use of a variety of the
instructions described thus far.

Processor Identification

The instruction repertoiers of all PDP-10 processors and the 166
processor used in the PDP-6 are very similar, and most programs require
no changes to run on any of them.  Because minor differences and the
fact that some instructions are not available on the earlier machines, a
program that is to be compatible with all should have some way of
distinguishing which machine it is running on.  This simple test
suffices.

	JFCL	17,.+1		;Clear flags
	JRST	.+1		;Change PC
	JFCL	1,PDP6		;PDP-6 has PC Change Flag
	MOVNI	AC,1		;Others do not, make AC all 1s
	AOBJN	AC,.+1		;Increment both halves
	JUMPN	AC,KA10		;KA10 if AC = 1000000 (carry
	BLT	AC,0		; between halves)
	JUMPE	AC,KI10		;KI10 if AC = 0
	MOVEI	AC,1		;KL10 or KS10 if AC = 1,,1
	SETZ	AC+1,		;Big binary integer
	MOVEI	AC+3,1		;One digit byte
	EXTEND	AC,[CVTBDO]	;Convert will abort
	TLNE	AC+3,200000	;Test effect on N
	JRST	KL10		;KL10 if N set
	JRST	KS10		;KS10 if N unaffected
