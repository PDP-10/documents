I don't think this has been mentioned in this thread, I just ran across it.

                                                      SAILFAIL, Version: 18,
August 1976

   Author: Dan Swinehart, Robert Sproul, et al. 

   Revised by: Les Earnest, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 

   Source Language: FAIL Memory Required: 50K of user core Special Hardware
Required: 4-Series or
   later monitor Keywords: ALGOL; SAIL; FAIL; Programniing-Language 

   Abstract: SAIL is a high-level programming language for the PDP-10
computer. It includes an extended
   ALGOL 60 compiler and a companion set of execution-time routines. In
addition to ALGOL, the language
   features: 1) flexible linking to hand-coded machine language algorithms,
2) complete access to the PDP-10
   I/O facilities, 3) a complete system of compile-time arithmetic and logic
as well as a flexible macro system, 4)
   a high-level debugger, 5) records and references, 6) sets and lists, 7)
an associative data structure, 8)
   independent process, 9) procedure variables, 10) modifial error handling,
I 1) backtracking, and 12) interrupt
   facilities. 

   FAIL is a fast, one-pass assembler for the PDP- 10 machine language.
Although FAIL uses substantially
   more main memory than MACRO-10, it assembles typical programs in less
than one-fifth the cpu time used
   by MACRO-10. FAIL permits an ALGOL-style block structure which provides a
means of localizing the use
   of some symbols to certain parts of the program, such that the same
symbol name can be used without conflict
   tct mean things in different blocks. 

   Note: A. No commitment is made to support this or any other version of
SAIL with bug fixes or subsequent
   releases. Users interested in a maintained version should contact
Tymchare, Inc. B. When putting up the
   SAIL system the author suggests first reading the file TELLEM. C. This
version is for TOPS-10 only,
   TOPS-20 and Tenex sites should use 20-2. D. Documentation for FAIL is on
the tape. 

   DEC-20 Review Note: See 20-2. 

   Media (Service Charge Code): Microfiche (CA), Manual (EC), 2400' Magtape
(PA) or order 10-LIB-1

And SImula-67 should be available somewhere and is a superset of Algol
60 adding Pascal like features + object programming. Can be found on
old DECUS library tapes.

Just did a search and Simula is there as well. Check out 
http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/www/lib10/0337/index.html

There were later versions than this but they had a small commercial
charge associated and so were not submitted to DECUS. Could probably
be obtained at no charge today

SAIL was quite nice.  At Columbia we actually "standardized" on it as our
general-purpose programming language for several years, and used it for
everything from systems programs to accounting systems and user ID management
to instruction and research.  For TOPS-20, we wrote a SAIL-callable COMND JSYS
library.  We bought a truckload of SAIL manuals from Stanford and passed them
out to everybody.  SAIL had all sorts of terrific features that are lost to
the ages, and its platform-independent successor, MainSAIL, was even better.
If we had something like that to work with today instead of C, the world would
be a better and safer place.

Unfortunately bugs in the SAIL runtime system tended not to get fixed and
eventually we gave up on it for system programming and administration and
went back to assembler (MACRO, FAIL, and/or Midas) which was almost as much
fun as SAIL.

And yes, Simula was nice too -- the birthplace of Object-Oriented Programming.

Compared to these, Algol-10 was a toy.  But in fairness, Algol 60 was never
intended to be a practical programming language -- it was only for expressing
algorithms; it didn't even have i/o.  Still, it was one of the 2 or 3 most
influential programming languages ever.  Probably THE most influential, having
pioneered the concepts of block structure, scope, GOTO-less programming, and
so on, which found their way into PL/I, Pascal, C, C++, Java, and most
everything else you can think of except Fortran and Cobol (which predated
Algol-60), LISP, SNOBOL, and APL.

Thanks to the efforts of Ronald Tatum working from a very bad copy, the
PDP-10 ALGOL Programmer's Reference Manual from the late 60's or early 70's
is now online at the PDP-10 Emulation Webpage.

	http://www.aracnet.com/~healyzh/pdp10emu.html

It is in seven parts with a errata page where Ronald Tatum did his best to
figure out what some of the 'smudges' on his copy said.  Unfortunatly
apparently whoever copied this back around '74 or earlier didn't consider 
the page that would have dated the manual worth copying.
