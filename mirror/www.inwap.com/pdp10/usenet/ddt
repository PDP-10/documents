Incomplete memory.

FILDDT could peek at the running monitor.  If write-enabled,
FILDDT could poke at the running monitor.  You could not set
breakpoints with FILDDT, but you could load the symbol table
from SYSTEM.EXE and view locations and values symbolically.

I would use EDDT to set a breakpoint on a dummy routine when the
Monitor was loaded.  While the system was running, I would use
FILDDT to patch some instruction to jump to the dummy routine under
certain conditions.  When the system hit that condition, the Monitor
would come to a screeching halt, with EDDT running on the console.

Don't forget DDT.REL (statically loaded with user's program), VMDDT.EXE
(dynamically merged in when DDT.REL was not loaded), and that FILDDT came in
two flavors (TOPS-10 and TOPS-20) all from the same source.

EDDT.REL, while designed to run in kernel mode, was capable of running in user
mode as well, using UUOs or JSYS for I/O to the terminal.  This allowed
for patching the Monitor by using
	.GET SYS:SYSTEM
	.DDT
	* manually patch things or read in a file with DDT commands
	^C
	.SAVE SYS:SYSTEM
