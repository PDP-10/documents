Good question, and I don't know the answer.  I *do* know several
folks who do have distribution tapes, but they won't let me touch
them.  It's a shame - they have the tapes but no 9-track drive,
and I have a room full of 7-track and 9-track drives but I don't
have the -10 and -20 distribution tapes.

If and when someone does dig up any relevant tapes, I'll gladly make
exact images of them here and put them up for FTP.  I'd also be happy
to put the CD mastering facilities here to use in writing CD's
with the software for distribution.  (Assuming these activities
are allowed under the terms of the license, of course...)

In the meantime, I *do* have several hundred megabytes of DECUS
PDP-10 (10-xxx and TOPS 20-xxx numbers) freeware sources and binaries
available.  Would folks be interested in this collection?  Below
I've got a list of TOPS-20 package titles and their status...

                     Prepared by David Todd
             DECUS DECSYSTEM-20 Library Coordinator
                          15 March 1981



     The following list describes the contents of the DECUS
DECSYSTEM-20 Library Distribution Tapes as of 15 March 1981.  The
program packages in the Library were converted from the
DECsystem-10 Library during the summer and autumn of 1980 by Paul
Robinson at Wesleyan University for DECUS.  During the
conversion, packages were evaluated using the following criteria:

     1.  Does the package support features available under
         TOPS-20 or on the DECSYSTEM-20?  For example, DECtape
         support packages were deleted.

     2.  Does the package compile, load, and begin execution
         successfully?

     3.  If test data are available, does the recompiled program
         correctly run the test data.

     4.  Is the package of such high potential value that even if
         it does not compile and load correctly it should be
         distributed in hopes an interested DECSYSTEM-20 user
         will develop a working package?

     5.  Even if there is no source code, is the package of such
         high potential value that users would benefit from
         having just the .EXE files available?

Under these criteria, the following packages were selected to
constitute the initial DECSYSTEM-20 Library.  The abstracts below
do not describe the packages but rather the state of the package
after review, and in cases where modifications were required, the
types of modifications made.  Refer to the DECUS DECSYSTEM-20
Library Catalog for program descriptions.

     Note that several of the major packages, notably PASCAL,
SIMULA, and SAIL/FAIL, were submitted as revised versions by
Charles Hedrick of Rutgers.  We are grateful to him for his help
in making these packages available.

     In the descriptions, the phrase "compiled, loaded, and
executed successfully" indicates that the program package begins
execution successfully but that no verification of the accuracy
of the program has been done.  The phrase "executes correctly"
indicates that the program was tested either with data supplied
with the package or with obvious test data and appears to execute
correctly on that test data.

     Of course, DECUS cannot guarantee correct execution of any
of the packages but welcomes - in fact solicits - reviews of
packages which do not appear to function as specified.  For this
purpose, the first directory on the distribution tape,
<DECUS.20-0000> contains review forms and an interactive review
program which will aid you in preparing a review of any program
you use.  Please submit the completed review on 1600 bpi DUMPER
tape (preferably) or as typewritten copy of the completed review
form to DECUS for review by DECUS staff and inclusion on
subsequent releases of the distribution and update tapes.  You
will find on this tape reviews of several packages kept with the
package directory.  The review files have names of the form
DECnnn.RNO, where "nnn" is the number of the DEC-20 package.  The
reviews were completed for the versions running on the
DECsystem-10 but should still be valid for the DECSYSTEM-20
versions as well.

     The Library packages are stored as separate directories with
naming conventions <DECUS.20-nnnn>, where "nnnn" is a sequence
number.  Directory <DECUS.20-0000> contains Library
administration files such as the .RNO file which created this
document, a "disposition" document which tells the disposition of
DEC-10 library packages by DEC-10 number cross-referenced to
DEC-20 number, review programs and forms, and a file which can be
used by DLUSER to create DECUS directories if desired.  Note that
there are subdirectories under many DECUS.20-nnnn directories.

     The Library distribution tapes contain the complete DECUS
DECSYSTEM-20 program library packaged on 9-track, 1600-bpi,
DUMPER-format magnetic tape.  There are five tapes, and their
contents are as follow:

          ____
          ___   ________
          1     0000-0025
          2     0026-0076
          3     0077-0099
          4     0100-0135
          5     0136-0149

Each tape contains 8000 to 10,000 pages of programs.  We hope to
hav regular updates for these program plus new additions made
available in the future through a subscription service in the
same way the DEC-10 library is served.  Contact the DECUS office
for details.



DECSYSTEM-20 Library Distribution Notes [2 Feb 81]/HDT     Page 3


"20"      "10"
Number    Number    Status


0001      -         CALC (TOPS-20)
                    Compiles, loads, and runs successfully.
                    Indirect commands do not appear to function.

0002      86        SAIL/FAIL
                    Original DEC-10 version has been supplemented
                    by some routines supplied by Charles Hedrick
                    of Rutgers which fix bugs on the DEC-20.
                    Program appears to compile correctly.  The
                    newly compiled version differs from the one
                    submitted by Hedrick;  the newly compiled
                    version is the .EXE file and the version
                    submitted by Hedrick is SAIL-OLD.EXE.  Check
                    the file SAIL.LOG to see error messages
                    associated with compilation of SAIL.

0003      283       SYSTEMS PROGRAMMERS PASCAL
                    Native-20-mode System Programmer's PASCAL
                    from Charles Hedrick at Rutgers.  Executes
                    correctly in preliminary tests.  Has
                    excellent debugging enhancements over earlier
                    versions.

0004      -         INTERLISP (TOPS-20)

                    Patched BOOT.SAV to replace a JSYS which had
                    been deleted after Release 2 of TOPS-20;
                    program now begins execution.  Note that no
                    source files are supplied (.EXE only) and
                    that the first chapter of the manual is
                    missing.  Other chapters renamed *.DOC.

0005      12        PAL-10
                    Minor modification required in logical name
                    list;  compiles, loads, and runs
                    successfully.

0006      22        JACOBI
                    Converted subroutine calls to PUSHJ/POPJ;
                    now compiles correctly.  Execution testing
                    not done.

0007      23        SPEEDY (PDP-10/8 Loader)
                    Loader appears to run from a load of the .REL
                    file (no testing done).  Source file is
                    garbled and cannot be used to generate the
                    .REL file.

0008      27        GASP II
                    Compiles and loads cleanly.  No further
                    testing done.
0009      30        NVERTX
                    Compiles with some warning messages, loads,
                    and runs to completion with the test data

0013      43        RANDOM NUMBERS
                    Converted subroutine calls to PUSHJ/POPJ;
                    programs now compile, load, and run
                    successfully.  Results not checked for
                    accuracy.

0014      57        SIMPLE
                    Converted subroutine calls to PUSHJ/POPJ;
                    programs now compile, load, and correctly run
                    the test data supplied with the programs.

0015      59        LISP 1.6
                    Redefined JOBDAT symbols and replaced one
                    outdated JSYS.  Some possible problems with
                    source file ALVINE.MAC (HRRZ@ opcodes).  No
                    testing done on this package.

0016      61        MLISP
                    No modifications required.  Package is
                    expected to be a transportable LISP package,
                    but no testing was done.

0017      65        LEARNS
                    Program compiles, loads, and runs

                    Program compiles and runs successfully.

0022      89        JOTTO
                    Typographical errors were corrected.  Program
                    compiles but needs a dictionary.

0023      90        BARTEE
                    Redefined JOBDAT symbols;  program
                    compiles,loads, and correctly executes test
                    data given in .DOC file.

0024      97        BASIC TUTORIAL
                    A random sample of programs tested functioned
                    correctly.

0025      100       ONLINE BASIC AND FORTRAN DEMOS
                    A random sample of the BASIC programs ran.
                    FORTRAN files which did not run were modified
                    for FORTRAN-20 compatibility.  Files were
                    given filetypes .BAS, .FOR, and .TXT,
                    depending upon their functions.  Calling
                    sequence of RAND.MAC was converted to
                    PUSHJ/POPJ.

0026      101       SSP
                    Programs ran without modification and gave
                    results in agreement with expected test
                    results to within 5 to 7 significant figures.

0027      102       PDP-8 SIMULATOR
                    Changed JOBDAT symbols;  compiles, loads, and
                    runs successfully.

0028      104       SNOBOL4
                    Converted .SHR to .EXE file;  the .EXE file
                    runs.  No attempt to recompile and reload
                    (which should be done).

0029      105       DOCTOR AND ELIZA
                    Converted .SAV to .EXE file, which functions
                    correctly.  No source file is included.

0030      110       CHESS
                    Converted .SAV file to .EXE file, which
                    functions correctly.  No source file is
                    included.

0031      114       MATTAC
                    Converted .SAV file to .EXE file, which runs.

0032      115       TAPBLK
                    Converted .SAV file to .EXE file, which
                    begins execution.  Did not test.


0033      116       QED
                    Redefined JOBDAT symbols.  Program compiles,
                    loads, and executes.

0034      130       RENBR
                    Compiles, loads, and runs successfully.  The
                    .CMD file was modified for TOPS-20.

0035      133       ALGOLW
                    Redefined JOBDAT symbols.  Program compiles,

                    Edited the source file to delete extra
                    CRLF's.  Program compiles, loads, and runs
                    successfully.

0037      137       COB300
                    Modified one variable to be a non-reserved
                    word;  program compiles and loads.  Should be
                    tested on a Burroughs COBOL program.

0038      139       TALK8F
                    Redefined format of octal constants and
                    redefined JOBDAT symbols.  Program compiles,
                    loads, and runs.  Needs a PDP-8 for testing.

0039      142       MATHLAB
                    Converted .SAV to .EXE file, patched ESC
                    character as described in manual.  Program
                    ran test case in manual correctly.  Program
                    should be recompiled and reloaded.

0040      143       COBSTD

                    Minor syntactical correction required, but
                    otherwise program compiled, loaded, and ran

                    revised version is available directly from
                    DEC.

0043      156       ASYNC COMMUNICATION WITH PDP-8
                    Redefined JOBDAT symbols and altered logical
                    name search.  Programs now compile, load, and
                    run.  Needs testing with a PDP-8.

0044      157       STREAM
                    Changed subroutine calls to PUSHJ/POPJ's.
                    Fixed argument list references.  Program now
                    compiles and loads.  Needs testing.

0045      159       PAGER
                    Program compiles, loads, and runs
                    successfully.

0046      161       ABACUS
                    Minor modifications required because of MACRO
                    version changes.  Program compiles, loads,
                    and runs successfully.

0047      164       CROSS
                    Created IOFIL.FOR to handle IFILE/OFILE
                    subroutine calls from F40 and modified
                    RENAME.MAC to use PUSHJ/POPJ calls.  Modified
                    FORMAT statements.  Program now compiles,
                    loads, and runs test case correctly.

0048      165       RDMT11
                    Compiles, loads, and runs successfully.
                    Needs testing with PDP-11 magnetic tapes,
                    though.

0049      167       GENPLT
                    Added DOUBLE PRECISION statement to allow 6
                    characters per word.  Programs compile, load,
                    and run test case correctly.

0050      168       TBLTRN
                    Modified one macro subroutine to use
                    PUSHJ/POPJ calling convention.  Program
                    compiles, loads, and runs successfully.

0051      169       CTFFT
                    Program compiled, loaded, and ran one test
                    file correctly (within roundoff error).  The
                    other test file (for subroutine FOURG) was
                    garbled at the time of original submittal.
                    The subroutine compiles, however.

                    FORTRAN-20 form;  changed DEFINE FILE to
                    OPEN;  and changed search for SIGN.LIB from
                    [1,4] to SYS:.  Program compiles, loads, and
                    runs correctly.

0056      178       MTIO
                    Changed calling sequence to PUSHJ/POPJ.
                    Program compiles.  Needs to be tested with a
                    magtape and main program.

0057      179       FASBOL
                    Converted .SAV to .EXE file, which appears to
                    run (saved as FASBOL.EXE).  Recompiled,
                    reloaded, and resaved as SNOBOL.EXE (which
                    appears to run correctly).

0058      181       EDITS
                    A spurious character in source file was
                    deleted.  Program compiles, loads, and runs
                    successfully.

0059      182       TXTPAD AND TXTTAB
                    Programs compile.  TXTPAD has undefined
                    globals on loading because of need for
                    hardware routines.  TXTTAB ran successfully.

0060      183       GRAPH
                    Subroutines compile and load with warnings.

0061      185       SYNTAX
                    Fails to compile, but code is sufficiently
                    similar to PASCAL that conversion to working
                    PASCAL code should be relatively easy.  Left
                    in the library for revision by interested
                    user.

0062      186       META2

0066      193       *1
                    Needs to be recompiled.  No testing done.

0067      197       FILTER
                    Sources compiled with numerous errors caused
                    by use of (new) reserved words.  Changes yet
                    to be made but should be easy to fix.
0068      198       IMP72
                    Converted .SAV file to .EXE, which ran
                    successfully.  Recompilation fails for some
                    program modules.

0069      200       VTED AND RTRANS
                    RTRANS runs correctly.  VTED needs testing on
                    DEC VT terminals.

0070      203       GUNNER
                    Program runs correctly.

                    loads, and runs successfully.


0077      221       NMRSIM AND TTYOPS
                    Changed subroutine calling sequence to
                    PUSHJ/POPJ;  programs compile, load, and run
                    successfully.  No testing without plotter
                    hardware.

0078      223       SIMULA
                    Compiler assembled, loaded, and ran
                    successfully.  Note an error message
                    associated with module M2.MAC which is
                    apparently caused by a misplaced conditional
                    terminator, but the resulting symbol is
                    properly defined as external nevertheless.
                    Note that the package has been reorganized to
                    contain just DEC-20 code.

0079      224       SPICE/SLIC/SINC
                    Programs compile, load, and run correctly.

0080      226       AVAIL
                    Programs compile, load, and run correctly.
                    Note that there is a requirement for
                    directory numbers, though.  This program
                    should be modified when a native-20 FOROTS
                    system is available.

0081      227       UTILITIES
                    Some programs in this package needed COBOL
                    variable-names to be changed because of
                    changes in COBOL reserved words;  they then
                    compiled, loaded, and ran successfully.
                    Others in the package appear to be incomplete
                    and unusable.  Complete package is left in
                    the library for those who want to work on
                    them.

0082      228       CALCOMP PLOTTER PACKAGE
                    Some modifications required to get package to
                    load properly.  Programs compile, load, and
                    run successfully.  Requires plotter hardware
                    to verify.

                    Modified compiler to look for PILOT.EXE
                    rather than PILOT.SHR.  Compiler compiles
                    with a few MACRO "E" errors, but loads
                    successfully.  Resulting program successfully
                    compiled the demo program supplied.

0089      238       EXETER
                    Programs compile (with truncation warnings),

0100      257       LINCUR
                    Revised submittal lacked functions DARCOS and
                    DARSIN which were in the sources for original
                    submittal.  These were copied from original
                    into file DAFUNS.FOR and the load command
                    string modified.  File LINCUR.CTL contains
                    revisions necessary to compile, load, and
                    test revised version on a DEC-20.  Programs

0137      310       WMU Application Library
                    Most programs work as submitted.  Some work
                    done to load without overlays.  Individual
                    packages were split into separate
                    subdirectories.  Note that source code for
                    the application library built into WMU's
                    FORLIB are not contained in the package and
                    are referenced from APLIB.REL and FORLIB.REL
                    in the superior directory.

                    Program compiles with warning messages and
                    loads and runs correctly (when compiled with
                    the DEC-20 SIMULA from DECUS).  Packages
                    included so that anyone with SIMULA
                    experience can attempt to determine the
                    source of the problem.

0145      325       ANTE

0148      184       SPELL
                    Original program failed to compile because
                    symbols in conditional statements weren't
                    assembled and defined;  simple fixes to
                    source file were required.  Program now
                    compiles and runs correctly.  Dictionary is
                    preloaded in the .EXE file supplied.

                    messages, loads successfully, and appears to
                    process author-supplied test data correctly.
