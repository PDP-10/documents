As many of you will have heard by now, the Puget Sound area of Washington was
rocked by a fairly large earthquake at 10:54 local time this morning.  The
temblor was centered roughly 10 miles north of Olympia and 30 miles down.

The Seattle area escaped major damage, though Seattle-Tacoma Airport was closed
because all the glass in the air-traffic control tower shattering out, making
it unusable.  Olympia was hit much harder--visible damage to downtown buildings
and a large crack in the capital dome.

At the offices of XKL, in Redmond, we were very lucky.  The building is fairly
new (about 10 years old), so withstood the shaking; within our offices, only a
few items improperly stored on top of system consoles and the like fell to the
floor.

I hope that all our compatriots here in the Puget Sound area were as lucky.

Yup, a 6.8 magnitude.

The same at my home (site of Panda.COM and two working 2020 systems) and
office.  Just some small stuff fell, no damage and nothing broken.

One of the problems with reporting from one's own point of view is how wrong
one can be.  A number of older buildings in one of Seattle's historical areas
were damaged, some badly, and Boeing Field has damage to the runways.

Mark's home is a good deal closer to the epicenter than Redmond, so the capri-
cious nature of the damage is clear.  Some roads were badly damaged although
further away, including one of the approach roads to my house (though not my
usual route)--one rural highway suffered a break with a difference in height
between the two sides of about 2 feet (60 cm).

The damage estimates for the region are coming in at $2,000,000,000.  But there
were very few serious injuries and only one fatality (from a heart attack).

Thanks to everyone for allowing this little off-topic report.

Most of the damage was indeed to older buildings, and buildings in the
industrial area (largely built on fill).  Many of these old buildings have
extensive masonry.

Was it Boeing Field or Sea-Tac with the runway damage?

My understanding is that the epicenter was in the south end of Puget
Sound, so between that and the great depth of the quake it was pretty far
away from both of us.

The quake was violent; the worst that I've ever experienced.  I was just
finishing breakfast when it hit.  First I said "oh shit!", then I dove
under the dining room table.  My dog was outside on the deck, watching me
through the sliding glass door, but presently decided that she really
didn't want to be on a wooden deck in an earthquake and jumped onto terra
(non-)firma.

Stuff was shaking and knocking about.  At first, I was worried about the
house, but the intensity stayed about the same throughout and it became
clear that the house wasn't in trouble.  Then I worried about the
grandfather clock -- an heirloom that I had just spent a lot of money
fixing -- since I could hear it banging about.

When the quake stopped, I waited a couple of seconds and got up.  The
electricity was still on, and I didn't smell any gas.  The furnace and
clothes dryer were going the whole time.  The dining room chandelier was
still swaying violently.  So were the weights on the grandfather clock;
they had knocked the door open; fortunately the latch gave before the
glass did.  The clock didn't work when I tried starting it again.  I
discovered that the quake had caused the pendulum to separate from the
clockworks; the clockworks has a pin that got into a corresponding hole in
the pendulum, and this pin was at the side.  Simple to fix.

Throughout the house, little things had fallen down and pictures on the
wall were awry, but nothing was broken.  It took no more than about 5
minutes to go around and set everything right.

It was a similar story elsewhere on the island, although at the grocery
stores they had a lot of stuff fall from the shelves and the ceiling at
the Safeway partially failed.  I think that they've re-opened by now.

They kicked people out of the office building at UW where I work, but the
damage was only a couple of loose ceiling tiles and cracked drywall over
an expansion joint (OK, what ditz drywalled over an expansion joint??).
But the time I arrived, the structural engineers had already OK'd the
building for reoccupancy.

The bottom line is that although it was a hard hit, but it was a glancing
blow.  There was no disaster here.  By next week, I think that it'll be
forgotten.  Unlike SF, LA, or Kobe, this won't be a famous earthquake.

And also thanks to everybody for their good wishes.

Well, that was exciting!
A weird rolling sensation, like being on a boat that is taking on a wake
sideways. It was quite strong. No damage here in Vancouver except a
couple of windows that blew out. Looks like Seattle got the worst of it,
and apparently it was felt all the way to Salt Lake City.
But...now the sun is shining, the sky is blue and , if I didn't know
better, I'd say Spring has arrived! (With a bang, not a whimper... hee
hee).

Funny you should mention that. Just got through posting the following to our
local Mac User Group BBS:

[For those of you not familiar with the Seattle area, the Alaska Way Viaduct
is an older doubledecker highway that runs along the waterfront. Recent
California and Kobe quakes had similar roadways collapse, squishing cars and
their occupants.]

OK, so where's the one place you really wouldn't want to be during an
earthquake? The lower deck of the Alaska Way Viaduct?

That's where I was when it hit, between the downtown entrance and the Safeco
Field exit. The car started shaking, and I thought I was getting a flat
tire. Then I noticed the buildings to my left were losing pieces, chunks
peeling off and falling away.

The cars ahead of me started slowing down, despite my most rapid and
colorful vocal urging for them to not slowdown until AFTER we were off the
road. When we got to the off ramp, the light fixtures were swaying wildly,
and dust was rising along First Avenue South from falling chunks.

As you've all seen on TV by now, the damage was extensive. Lots of broken
windows. People were pouring out of their work places, many with cell phones
to their ears.

Once off the ramp, I pulled over and waited for my heartbeat to slow below
double-digit-beats-per-second, then drove on to my client. They are located
a couple of blocks south of Safeco. The building next to theirs had a large
chunk missing from the roof and top floor, the bricks littering the parking
lot below.

Their power was out, and about a half a dozen UPS battery back up devices
were beeping. I was unable to call home, due to cell phone system overload.
Since there was no work to be done, I chatted with the clients for a while,
then came home.

Our house was completely uneffected. Couple of crooked pictures on the wall,
that's it. It was a striking contrast to the scene I came from.

I love the Viaduct, and always have. I am thrilled and grateful it acquitted
itself so well today. I did, however, take Elliot Way home. No use pushing
it. ;-)
