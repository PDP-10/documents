The KL did (and Jupiter would have) all EA calcs with 30 bits of precision
while running with extended addressing support.  Tops-20 on the KL supported
23 bits of virtual address space (32 sections of 256K words).  I guess some
JSY couldn't reach across sections.

I don't recall the virtual address limits designed into the Jupiter hardware,
although they were surely larger than 32 sections.  At some point, Tops-20 on
Jupiter might have paused at supporting 27 bits of virtual address space,
because that required no interface changes in JSY that held page numbers in
halfwords.  I'm not aware of designs for Tops-20 that would have added 3 more
bits, but if the product line had continued, it surely would have expanded to
be as wide as the hardware allowed by now.

No, it's because there were only 32 words in the EPT for the section table
on the KL.  I think that the way that Jupiter and XKL did it was by having
an additional level of tables.  Assuming that a section table would be in
a page by itself, you'd need an 8 word table of section tables to cover
all 30 bits.

The VM implementation data structures are not sufficient to address the issue.

To rephrase: there existed FOO% JSY which were *not* reimplemented as XFOO%
with fullword address field arguments and results.  Hence, not every JSYS was
capable of pointing to out-of-section arguments.  Searching MONSYM for
``777777'' uncovers examples like CM%GJB in .CMGJB for COMND%.  Those JSY that
took an address in an 18-bit field couldn't reach across sections.

Yes, but you were saying that the KL supported 30 bit addressing which it
clearly did not.  The KL was limited to 22 bits of hardware addressed
memory and 23 bits of virtual addressed memory, and these were hardware
and microcode restrictions, not operating system restrictions (although
you would need to make OS changes to support a different organization of
section tables).

This actually wasn't particularly important.  I am one of the few people
who has actually written a multi-section program from scratch, as opposed
to converting an existing single-section program.  [Quick, anyone know
what it was?]  Most memory references were in-section, and this included
JSYS arguments.  Most of what you needed to reference in other sections
were things that you'd access with byte pointers, and the introduction of
OWGBPs greatly reduced the need to add a bunch of new jsi.

At least on the KL, you wanted to be careful about the sorts of memory
referencess you did inter-section, since you could really screw up
performance big time (Chuck Hedrick found that out with CLISP!) if you are
now aware of how the hardware page table (which caches virtual to physical
references in the microcode so it doesn't have to go through the section
and page tables each time).  The problem was that if you run
multi-section, you can have multiple pages which use the same HPT entry,
so if you reference a page whose HPT entry is in use by another page, the
HPT gets invalidated.  I forget if it just does a CLRPT on that one HPT
entry or if it effectively does a DATAO PAG, (invalidating the entire
HPT); I seem to recall that it was the latter.

Minor quibble: The KL used 30 bit addressing, but the high-order 7 bits
were a MBZ field.  (Must Be Zero.)

That is, if the virtual address was too big to fit into 23 bits, you would
get a page fault.  The high-order 7 bits were not ignored, which would have
been the case for modulo 23 bit addressing.

It's been a long time, but I can second this, as I also wrote *one*
multi-section program from scratch.  (It was a sickly imitation of the
DECmail-MS UA, without the network stuff, done before I heard about
MM.  I PMAP%ed the mailbox into an otherwise empty section for speed
and ease of manipulation at the expense of putting hard limits on
mailbox size.  It was really fast, and lots of fun to build, but
that's about the most I can say for it.)  The quote above pretty
accurately reflects my experience, what I can remember of it after a
decade or so.

(Or did you mean multiple *code* sections?  I've not done that.)

Of course, once you start doing multi-segment programs, you start kicking at
one of the the things that made the PDP-10 instruction set great - It was
relatively easy to understand, and mere mortals (like myself) could get work
done in it.  Fortunately, 256k words (~1mb) was enough to write a lot of
code in, even if most of it was Fortran.  And I say most realistically.
There were many features of the 10, or of any machine that you really wanted
to "get at", but you could not unless you used some assembly.  The learning
curve, I think for competing machines like the 370 was a lot longer for
assembly, and full utilisation of the machine was a lot more difficult.  In
other words, on the Dec-10 you could get undergraduate students to work
"wonders" because the engineers at DEC had built a machine that had the
needed functions, with good performance (better on a dollar basis!), are
presented them in an organized manner.

What I am saying is that the 18 bit length of the E calculation was in many
ways the crux of the machine, and had the PDP-10 been expanded, my
inclination would have to have build a 72-bit machine (or some such) with an
E calculation of 36 bits.  Try to build a culturally compatible machine, and
try not to add too many instructions like the Vax did.

I doubt that very much, for two reasons:

1)  Much of the TOPS-20 development was done on KI10s, since KL10s weren't
    yet available.  As you're well aware, the KI10 does not support any
    of the fancy paging features used by "TOPS-20 Paging" on the KL10.

2)  Many modern CPUs (e.g., MIPS) provide a TLB but leave management of
    the TLB entirely to software.  Such CPUs do not dictate the format
    (or even the existence) of page tables.

If there's some specific aspect of "TOPS-20 style virtual memory" which
you believe is unimplementable on modern CPUs, please explain.

Page faults on Alpha trap to "PAL code" which is just Alpha code that
has a lot of restrictions and lot of extra abilities.  I've long since
forgotten most of TENEX/TOPS-20 paging did, but I think that some of
the LRU/aging stuff wouldn't put much load on Alpha PAL code.

A lot of fundamental stuff is done in PAL code, HALT, interrupts, TLB
maintenance, system calls entry, etc.
