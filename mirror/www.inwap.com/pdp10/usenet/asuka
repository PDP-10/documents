Rainbow Brite has the latest code now, and I created an account at 42,2
for people to abuse.  Telnet to asuka.umtec.com, log in as ts10 (No
password, just push enter), then do LOGIN 42,2 to play with it.
The machine is still a P200, so it's still slow, but it should be usable.
Unless everyone decides to DIR [10,7] or SYSTAT all at the same time. ^_^
I'm nosing around to see if I can find a faster machine to stuff this on,
but don't hold your breath.

I still haven't solved the problem with multiple DZ11s, but I haven't
really looked at it either.  It's probably some stupid typo, I'll hack at
it tomorrow.

Thank you.  I hadn't logged in to a -10 in at least a decade.

I kept a tape with the sources for DBMS-10/20 V6 around until the day I left
DEC (in '94).  Of course, I wish I still had them :-)
