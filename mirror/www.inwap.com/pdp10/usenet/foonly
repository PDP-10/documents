Later versions used a modified Tenex called Foonex.

Sadly, no software or hardware/software docs for any of the F-series has
been located yet.

I'll ask Karol what happened to it the next time I see him.

In the time I've known him (about 15 years) I don't recall seeing
it (would be hard to miss..)

I received the following in mail from Dave Sieg who worked with the system
while it was at Paramount:

-> When Omnibus folded in 1986, Jim Rapley, who had worked with me on
-> the F1, had a friend whose company I believe was called Intergon.
-> They acquired the F1 and the PFRs and tried making movies with it.
-> I believe they were not successful, and as I understand it, Intergon no
-> longer exists.  Jim Rapley would probably be the one person that would
-> know where the remains of the system are.  I had an email address for
-> him but can't seem to find it.

I can't find anything useful on Intergon, but I may be able to find some
things on Jim Rapley.  I know some people who worked on Tron and spent
time at Omnibus. Of what little I've found so far, the above seems like
the best lead.

MAXC and MAXC II are pretty well documented. There was an article
in IEEE computer about MAXC (May 1978 pp 57-67) and I have scans
of some information on it at www.spies.com/aek/pdf/xerox

Something I had wondered about was HOW they got it done so quickly.

I suspect it had a lot to do with Thacker, et al 's experience at
Berkeley Computer Corporation building the BCC-500. They knew how
to build microcoded machines, having just built that one, and they
also decided to use the then new semiconductor RAM devices rather
than go through the pain they went through with the flakey core
memory system they bought for the BCC.

I'm less familiar with the BBN people who came over to PARC at
the same time that worked on MAXC (Fiala in particular) but I'm
sure they must have been as sharp as the folks who came over
from BCC.

I worked at triple-I (after the Movie division went elsehwere),
and I've got a scan of a couple of documents related to the Foonly and 
the Tron project:

By "Mars" I assume you mean Systems Concepts, a company whose first product
allowed the attachment of IBM bus-and-tag devices to PDP-10 systems on the
IObus; they eventually built a successful clone family (the SC-30M, the SC-25,
the SC-20, and the SC-40).  The -40 was licensed by CompuServe, who built
their entire network using these things to replace older DEC equipment; their
needs were so great that SC could not keep up with demand.

Foonly was also in business very early, building clones of the early PDP-10
systems.  A follow-on design, the SuperFoonly, migrated to DEC and became
the underpinnings of the KL10 processor.

And there is a third company I heard about...
