Um, not really. RSX-20F was derived by "Bugsy" and the group from
RSX-11D, as you say, with various drivers and other things from
RSX-11M. People wanted to use RSX-11D because of its real time
features, but the system calls of RSX-11M were much nicer, so we threw
them in. But the command parser (cleverly named PARSER), was written
from scratch and has no relation with RSX-11D or RSX-11M commands.
This is something the RSX-11D group can be proud of.

I know this to be true because Rollo Belanger and I wrote most of the
KL-10 RSX-20F PARSER. It was generally a pretty bad job, in part
because the "language grammar" was a compromise designed by a
committee and kept changing and in part because Field Service had a
lot of input into the console command language, and they had very
fixed ideas about what it should be like, which weren't driven by any
aesthetic sense, and any talk about language "design" or theory was
quickly shot down. Marketing and management wanted to do whatever FS
wanted, so long as the thing could be booted, they really didn't care
what the console command langauge looked like. This, in my view at the
time and in my view now, was an unfortunate mistake.

Anyway, the command language ended up being pretty much a hack. There
were some nice features (the way repeats worked always amused me--you
could nest them and variables would be saved in a way that would alow
recursive functions), but not very many. The PARSER program was not,
in other words, derived in any way from the RSX command parser, and it
really didn't have much in common with it (I vaguely recall that we
copied how the file directory command output looked for PDP-11
devices, and it could parse input in a way that could theoretically
make MACRO-11 happy but it never did). The thing was compiled using a
program MACY11 or MACDLX or some such name, which was a cross-compiler
which ran on the -10, and then loaded onto a floppy or DECTAPE which
booted the RSX20F system and the PARSER was in the joblist when it
booted. The typical RSX-11D command parser simply wouldn't run on
RSX20-F, as far as I know.

And wasn't there some funny stuff that had to be done since the -11
side of the file system wasn't 16-bit?

One of the projects that I had on my to-do list was to mechanize
the build procedures for RSX20-F.  That never got done.  When the
last developer left DEC, all the build information was lost.  When
I pointed this out (I wanted Mike to train me to do a build before
he left) to the management, the thinking was that we could always
get Roland to show us just like he did when Mike was hired.

Why is this guy even thinking of trying to simulate the -20F
side of the KL?  It was a pain in the ass concept (sorry, Phil,
I'm talking with a TOPS-10 monitor developement hat now :-))
and one of the things the guys would have dearly loved to 
trade for lights.

You mean it WAS 16bits. The boot RP04/6 was dual ported one to the RH20
in the KL and the other to the RH10 on the PDP-11. The 11 had track 0
formated in 16bit mode and so the drive spoke to the 11 it 16 bit words
and when the PDP-10 final got its brain loaded it spoke to the drive
in 18bit mode for the rest of the disk. You could get the PDP-11 to
serv its 16bit mode filesystem back to the 10 via one of the DTE
protocols.

I don't think I ever understood DTE protocols.  I know that the
-11 was 16-bit.  But the cables that went to our disks (the dual
ports) were 18-bit...were they not?  And retrieving data from
the disk from the -11 side took some munging.  I do know that 
the -10 side of that dual ported disk would not have been content
with only 16 bits of data on a fetch.

But, then on the other hand, hardware was never my strength; I
left that part of the business to the guys to finger out :-).

That might make two of us?:) the DTE was just a physical interface
with interupts and IO basically DMA from 11-mem to DTE to 10-mem
or 10-mem to DTE to 11-mem the protocol(s) where schemes (protocols)
developed to drive certian types of communications between
TOPs and the various devices on the PDP-11 most basically the console
then various other serial devices and don't forget the line printer
which had its own protocol.

There was no munging the port to the 11 was clocked to read a 16 bit
word from the serial data stream that came from the disk head
and the 10 port was clocked to read 18 bits into the register

The only time the 10 every munged data was when it had to deal with 
rather odd things call 9 track tapes. It had no problem with the older
7 bit drives where it could just stuff sixbit+parity onto the tape
but 8bit+parity, it had to convert this. Two forms basically existed
one which was really wastefull of tape which I think was core dump
format (?) which was used by very simple boot programs and
then some strange packing algorithm that you will find documented on
the web for stuffing 36 bit words efficently on tape. This was all 
accomplished by a piece of hardware in tape controller which I think was 
a M8914 board aka bit fiddler ...

If thats a typo I'm not sure, "finger" out that could have all sorts

Not quite.  Transmitting data in 8-bit bytes for DECnet was done in software,
because I can recall someone trying to speed things up in some pack/unpack
algorithm.

Huh.

Yep, here it is:

BFLR1 is just a joke, not a real 2-5-4-2 code.

Yuck!!!  Why?  Just because the 11 drivers depend on 22 sector mode, or is
there some reason I'm missing why you can't access the low 16 bits of each
data word from the 11?  I would think it would just drop the high 2 bits of
each word (on the 18-bit "data" half of the Massbus) when reading and let
them float to zero when writing, or at worst it would read/write scrambled
data (if I remember right even the A/B versions of the RH11 had all 18 bits,
I think the M7294 mods in the RH11C are for something else).

The cables are indeed 18 bits wide for the data half, 16 for the control
half so everybody should be happy.

Oh yes. I tried to repress the memory of this... it was an awful hack.
Well, it was sort of 16-bit, that is, RSX20F could read files stored
on the PDP-10 side, although it never worked well, through a routine
which mapped headers and such, mediated by the DTE-20. 18 bits were
tranmitted, and the 2 high order bits (as I recall) were discarded.
But the basic file system used for floppies (8") and DECTapes was
RSX-11 format, so it was sort of 16 bit too. Data intended for the -10
were packed as PDP-10 halfwords, so you lost even more space, but this
never mattered. And there was a special format for microcode loads,
but I don't think we ever finished implementing this. At least it

Build procedure?? I never saw anyting like that, fer sure. Stuff was
complied using MACY11 and written to DECtape, and then loaded and then
dumped onto floppies (for floppy based machines). Nothing automated
about it. Since MACY11 (or MACDLX sometimes) didn't know enough to
write tape or floppy media, I'd think you'd need to machanize it on an
RSX-11D system. Never occurred to us to try...

Oh, no need for apologies. We thought it was an awful hack at the
time, and it proved to be so. Purity of concept certainly got short
shrift. We actually put the lights in, you know. There were RSX20F
commands which would display "lights" on the terminal. I was a big fan
of the KA10 lights, which told you everything you ever wanted to know,
so we put them in in the hope that someday someone would realize that
a display terminal would make a better console than the LA30 (hard
copy dot matrix) printers that FS and marketing wanted. You could even
make a repeat macro that would update the "lights" as the machine ran.
The problem here was that the DTE-20 would suck up interrupts at a
ferocious rate when you did this, so the whole machine would run a
little slower. But we figured that someday someone would want the
feature.

I can't think of ANY reason to simulate the horrible RSX20F interface,
except maybe an exercise in masochism that exceeds all normal bounds
and shouldn't be discussed in polite company. Certainly a front-end
console "simulator" would be necessary, but given the limited number
of things the DTE-20 could do from the -10 side, it would be better to
have a clean interface and ignore the rest. If you're building a
simulator, boot the sucker from simulated ROM and trap all DTE-20
calls with a return of success and throw them away. You won't lose
anything worth keeping.

I don't think that RSX20F was ever supposed to be pie in the sky. The
KL was a microcode machine, so that running diagnostics was going to
be a problem. If the microcode hardware was flaky, then the machine
would be a useless piece of iron (i.e. diagnostics wouldn't run). So
the logical decision was to have a front end which had feelers into
the hardware (via the DTE-20) and could load data, single clock the
hardware, and thus do diagnostics. It was actually a very logical way
of doing things. You had a simple known reliable machine (PDP-11/40
initially) which could run the complex diagnostics required to get the
complex hardware to a state where it could run its own diagnostics.

Once you've decided to do this lights and switches don't seem that
important, so the cost (which including maintenance is extremely high)
can't be justified.

Nobody in the KL group really cared that much about what the FE ran.
DAS (Digital Advanced Systems) wanted it to run DN8x type software so
that it would be a built-in network controller. Management wanted it
to run vanilla RSX-11 software so that they wouldn't have to spend any
money writing new software. Management won. SInce nobody wanted to put
much money into the beast, there wasn't much memory available. The
DTE-20 was viewed as a "real time" device, so RSX11D seemed like a
good starting point. So hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent
trying to shoehorn RSX11D into working with the DTE and with the
dual-ported disk drives, and more hundreds of thousands of dollars
were spent trying to write diagnostics that wouldn't crash RSX11D. On
top of all this, the -10 group was undergoing the birthing of "clean"
code, so that there were coding standards that people were supposed to
follow, but the -11 group had different standards. Finally, the -11
system programmer types kept changing the system calls (each for good
reasons and each time to make them better) so that the documentation
never matched the actual RSX20F system being used, and old code broke
all the time.

In the middle of this, we were trying to write the PARSER, which got
pretty short shrift. LCG FS (who later came to hate it) had VERY
definite ideas about how they wanted it done (among other things they
wanted it to look more like TOPS-20).

We had this idea in the back of our minds that eventually the whole
blasted thing would be replaced by a network front end anyway, which
of course never happened. So if there was a pie in the sky, that would
have been it. I still think the DN8x software would have worked
better.

Well, let's talk about the data that had to be exchanged.  At a
system startup, the date and time had to be given to the -10.
The file spec had to be transferred.  The TTY had to look like
a -10 terminal.  I still don't know how you kept it all separate.
And the -10 had to keep telling the -11 that it was still running
(remember all those KAFs?).

That mechanization was one of my rules of shipping software.  The
build of -20F had to be done on that PDP11/70.  Source control
was a figment of the current developer's imagination with no pointers 
to the latest edit.  Developers were terribly difficult critters
when it came to source control.  That's why we had such elaborate
procedures for the TOPS-10 monitor edits, build, and ships.  

See, if we could build a piece of software from the ground up,
then we were guaranteed that the field image sources were still 
around.   Losing sources was a very, very real danger.  We had
customers whose major gazillion dollar applications broke because
of our software updates and couldn't fix anything because the 
sources were just gone; the software worked so well bug fixes
were non-existant.  We had a lot of those lonely pieces of
software.  And -20F was one of the biggest.

Oh, I could tell stories about these critters and their quirks :-).

I don't think I ever knew about the light simulator.  It certainly
was true that a major hassle happened because TW insisted that 
the front end terminal be attached to a VT06 when he was debugging.
And when TW threatened strike, people provided the resources he
needed.

Well, now I guess I'm confused.  I thought the point of an emulator
was to be able to use this hardware that I have on my desk and have
it run TOPS-10 programs.  That way the executables
that we shipped on tape could be run asis on this Intel system.

Ah, I forgot about that. :-)  I think the "pie in the sky" thing
came from a conversation trying to convince TW that the KL was
a good thing.  He didn't debug on the thing for a long time.  If
he could, he always worked on the KI or the KA.

What management?  I knew there were nuts by then but I never
did have a good feel for the hardware side of the business.
My impression (whenever I dealt with them) is that they were
still in the Dark Ages when hardware didn't need an OS.
I suppose I'm going russle a few hares here :-).

Shit!  How the hell did you ever get any work done with all that
going on?  No wonder it was a mess.  Our technique was to train
our supervisor to keep that crap away from us.  What did you do,

Well, we could talk about this aspect if you wish.  I never did
quite figure out all the dynamics in this area.  I was just starting
to get at it (when I got sick) by tackling the KLAD pack.  I started
to get the awful sense that that whole aspect of our business was
run by the techs checking out the machines who hadn't a clue about
how to use the system as a user.

Amen.  And if it didn't work, we at least had people who could
fix it.  This was an aspect of shipping the software on our
monitor tape.  We always had to hire somebody special to any -20F work
and that was very nearly impossible to do even in the late 70s.

Okay, maybe I'm just losing my mind, but I was responsible for ALL of the 
TOPS-10 "unit record" device service routines during the period in which the 
KL was being introduced. I don't recall ever having to rewrite/modify CDPSRX, 
CDRSRX, LPTSER, etc., because of any KL specific changes to their 
interfaces/controllers. Seems to me they responded to the same CONOs/CONIs and 
DATAOs/DATAIs they did on the KA and KI. Did TOPS-20 do things differently?

Remember, the KL was introduced in two waves.

The KL-1080 was the same size and shape as a KI and had microcode loaded
from DECtapes via KLDCP.  As I understand it, most of those first boxes
came with the I/O-bus interface, so that the BA10 and other KA/KI peripherals
could be attached.

The second wave was the KL-1091.  In particular, the ones with MOS memory
instead of core memory.  They had microcode loaded from floppy via RSX20F.
Not as many of them had the I/O-bus interface, so they relied on the
Console Front-End for unit record devices.  By the time we were running
TOPS-10 7.03 started using extended addressing, the only visible difference
between RSX20F for TOPS-10 and RSX20F for TOPS-20 was one byte in the
"keep alive has failed" message.  When the -10 stopped, the -11 would send

I remember some late nights over in the Marlboro lab, working on
some of the console code for the 8600... this was early on in
the use of RT for the console, so we were still playing with
using the XL handler... I was working on getting a venus-version
of the XL driver working... I did, and sent mail back to my
then project leader, using a modem connected to the serial
port.

Turns out that code was not used, but the conditionals live on
in the XL driver code (unless they've been removed).

There was a poster somewhere which read

	"RT-11 turns venus on."

TOPS20 definitely had card readers directly on the primary front end. At least
SN's 2313 and 2447 did.  In fact, I found one of the early quasar glxlib bugs
(the first rev of v4.0 tops20) in the card reader driver.

Actually, in the early implementation, only one TTY was allowed. We
wanted to put in support for more, but marketing didn't want us to
because it might keep people from buying terminal controllers. The
support for them was left in RSX, though, and eventually I think there
were versions of it that supported multiple TTY's.

Let's see now, you want to support these various devices through a
front end, but you STILL don't need (1) RSX20F or (2) the PARSER in
particular. If you want hardware completeness, you could check and
whenever the -10 side makes a DTE-20 call, figure out what
pseudo-device it is trying to access and just redirect the function.
There weren't that many DTE functions, actually.

Or declare that FE's on your simulated machine have to be "naked" and
LPTs, card readers, etc. just get supported some other way (like the
BA10, which actually would be far simpler to emulate).

The DTE20 hardware only provided the -11 with the capability of reading
and writing -10 memory, but not vice versa.

Obviously suitable front end software on the -11 could provide this
functionality to the -10 if it was needed.

Thats my understanding each machine knows only about its interface to
the DTE you need to be setting up control structures and telling
your side of the DTE about them and so passing the data via the DTE to
the 10 or 11 on the otherside its a PDP-10 IO instruction to the DTE
that make its happen causing an interupt to the 11 (doorbell style).

DTESRV and various upper layers like TTYSRV CDRSRV LINEPR on the 10 side

When one did a bincom (binary FILCOM), did it compare the symbol

Chuckle.  Ah!  So the way to your working heart was to waft a
wire wrap gun in front of you :-).  I must admit that a wire
wrap gun was not in my bag of tricks.  It probably should have
occurred to me that an intriguing piece of hardware could be
used as an incentive :-).

Sometimes it mattered.  Especially if the operator decided that 
a dead -11 implied a dead -10.

The Colorado School of Mines went straight from a KA to KL-1091.
It was a low-boy cabinet, the same size and shape as a KL-2060 but
painted blue instead of orange.  It had the optional I/O-bus adapter,
which plugged in to the peripherals left behind from the KA.
Including the KA's TD-10 DECtape control unit and four drives.

So, the answer to Daniel's question is: There is no such thing as a KL10
DECtape controller.  There was a KA10 DECtape controller and a PDP11 DECtape
controller.  The former was available as an I/O device for a KL running
TOPS-10, the latter was the boot device for KLDCP and RSX20F on the KL-1080
and KL-1090.
