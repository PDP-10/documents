The KA at the Colorado School of Mines was similar to what Ken reported.
This is from memory.

CSM had 192 K words of core (128 + 64).  The TOPS-10 Monitor took up
about 92 K, leaving 100 K for user jobs.  Except for when accounting
ran at night, CORMAX was 40 K (enough for 2 big jobs and some smaller
ones in core at the same time).

CSM did not have an RD; we had swap space on DSKA.

If I remember correctly, DSKA was a single RP02 and DSKB was two RP03s.

We had two: DTA0-DTA7 and DTB0-DTB7

We had a 680I emulating a DC68 for current-loop ASR33 teletypes

Our BA-10 also had a card reader, a card punch, and a Calcomp 3-pen plotter.

Tape controller and tape drives (TU10 and TU20?, 7-track and 9-track).

They're both PDP-8 based.  The 680I was manufactured by a third party
company, the DC68 was nearly the same thing with DEC's badge on it

>Did CSM have a lot of current-loop ASR33s?

The KA-10 had current-loop almost exclusively driving ASR33s.
  6 in top floor of the Green Center (Computing Center)
  2 in Hill Hall (Math)
  3 in Alderson Hall (Petroleum Engineering); 1 on each floor
  3 in Meyer Hall (Physics); 1 on each floor
  1 in Chauvenet Hall (Mining)
  1 in Stratton Hall (Earth Sciences)
  3 in Hill Hall (Metallurgy); 1 on each floor
  some number in Guggenheim (Administration).

I forget now how the high-speed graphics terminals (1 each of ARDS
and Tektronix 4010) were connected to the KA.  They may have had
current-loop to RS232 converters, running at 1200 baud.

All the ASR33's got replaced with LA36 hardcopy terminals one year.
(Wow, 300 baud!  Three times faster than than 110!!)

The ADM3's arrived around 1977.  The "glass teletype" had the cursor
fixed on the bottom line; like a teletype the text could only scroll up.

Some of the ADM3's were upgraded to ADM3A (direct cursor addressing and
lower case).  New carrels were installed in the Computing Center with
Visual-200 terminals.  The guy who ran the Green Center had a
Concept-100 in the basement.  I had a VT100.  The departements were able
to choose their own terminals.

The terminals were connected to a terminal multiplexor from DCA,
which allowed connecting to either CRUNCH (the KL-1091) or MUNCH
(the KS-2020).
