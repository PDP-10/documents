Yes, RCS/RI is very interested in items like this.  We recently upgraded
our library facility to better organize our collection of documention,
media and archives.

We have been working on two systems: a 2020 and a 2065.  We have a
number of documents that can be made available to interested folks.

Our next open house is on Saturday, Oct. 21 in Providence RI.  See
http://www.osfn.org/rcs for details.  It is open to the public, at no
charge.
