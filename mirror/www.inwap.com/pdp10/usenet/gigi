Well, not quite all the customers.  They actually sent an official Education
Representative to my office (not just me, making the rounds at Berkeley CS),
and I told him to make the Help feature work even if you have your colors set
to white on black, and that was many years ago, and it still doesn't work.
(You might think that given the helpfuless of MS help messages it would be an
improvement to see them in black-on-black, but the trouble is that third party
software developers use MS Help too.)

This gave me a smile.  At my high school computer lab we had both GIGIs
and Atari 800s as graphics terminals for our Unix machine (because we
got them both free -- graphics terminals cost way too much back then).
The Ataris were definitely easier to program, but the GIGIs had better
resolution, so you could edit text on them, too; the Ataris were useless
for text with only 40 columns.  And the GIGIs came with that cool
screen print feature.

I had a Pacman file that drew a yellow circle with a narrow black wedge,
and then redrew a larger wedge that blinked between yellow and black.
The stair-step effect every 12 pixels worked out good for this.  It also
included code that scrolled the whole thing horizontally, flashed all
the LEDs on the keyboard, and made wacka-wacka sounds.
