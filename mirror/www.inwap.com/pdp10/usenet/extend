I heard that it was for the COBOL compiler.  The only EXTEND instruction
that was routinely used by normal people was MOVSLJ, which was a faster
string copy than a ILDB/IDPB/SOJG loop and even some of the hairy byte blt
algorithms.  Even then, MOVSLJ was mostly used by folks who wrote extended
addressing programs.

I guess that XBLT was probably also useful for someone, but I don't recall
ever having to use it.  If you're doing that sort of thing, it's probably
much better just to change the page mapping.  I mean, how often do you
want to make a private copy of data from one section into another?

One reason was so that the COBOL compiler with BIS (Business Instruction
Set) could do BCD arithmetic directly.

Under the EXTEND opcode were:
1) "G" format floating point numbers (2.8E309 instead of 1.7E38)
2) string move and compare
3) XBLT
4) convert binary to string and back
5) the godawful EDIT instruction.

The four most common G-float instructions were added where there
were holes in the opcode table (GFAD=102, GFSB=103, GFMP=106, GFCV=107).
But the opcode to convert G-float to F, D, 36-bit int and 72-bit int
had to go under EXTEND because there were no more opcodes available.

XBLT was very useful.  But the rest of the extended instructions were
useful mainly for the people who wrote the COBOL compiler.

Does anyone have benchmarks showing how much faster a KL with microcode
version 271 or later and COBOL-74/BIS was compared to KL with the
old microcode?  I don't think it was that impressive.  IMHO the BIS
wasted precious microcode space.  I remember seeing one comment in the
release notes saying "That's it folks - the last available word of
microcode has been used.  There will be no further improvements."
