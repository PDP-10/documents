As I remember, the answer is "no".  It was not a new pager, it was a
pager with a larger TLB (translation look-aside buffer).  It meant that
more virtual-to-physical translations were kept in the pager, which
reduced the number of times that the microcode had to go to the page
tables.  As for the cache, there were simply more entries in the table
that was indexed into by a portion of the physical address bits.  The
microcode was unaware of the increased table size; there simply were
less cache misses than before.

There might have been such a mod.  The FS guy we had was very good, fast
and precise.  I might have been out of the machine room when he did that
piece.

I think the 2 set limit for the MG20 might have been related to either power
or cooling limitations.  I know that FS didn't like you to run the processor
for any length of time with the cages opened.  Anyway, I can't give you
a definite on that one.  If I can dig up one of my FS buddies from TOPS20
days they might remember.  The power supplies on those systems were
always a problem.  It got to a point were FS cache'd a spare main power
supply on site for us.

Yes, that was the size of a max'ed out MF20.  Its not really that unusual, just
a multiple of 256K word chunks which was a pretty common unit to sell
memory in those days.  768Kw is enough to timeshare quite a few people
with good response.  When I first started working at the site we had only
512Kw of MB core memory (which was _really_ slow) and we handled about
40 interactive users combined with batch cobol jobs running the university
accounting systems.

This one I'm not sure of..  We had two KL's at our site.   One ended up with
a single MG20 and the other had two max'd MF20's.  If you could put 4 on
the processor there must have been an additional cab you needed to
purchase because 2 mem units really filled up the M-box.

Yes, that was the limit, and you got 3MW on the system.  One of our KLs at LOTS
had that configuration until we got more MG20.

The hardware limit on the KL was, as you say, 4MW.  On Tops-20, the logical
address space prior to version 4 (extended addressing) was 256KW; after the
invention of extended addressing on the KL (30 bits of address), the logical
address space went to 8MW (23 bits of address).

The XKL-1 CPU on the Toad-1 implements the full 30-bit physical address space
as well as the 30-bit logical address space when running Tops-20; our Tops-10
implementation only went to 32MW physical so that we didn't have to schratz
around with creating another level of page tables in an OS we didn't know as
well.

In the Blaauw & Brooks taxonomy [*], architecture is what is seen by the
programmers.  In that sense, the PDP-6 and KA10 are nearly identical.
The later PDP-10 processors are mostly the same, with the addition
of paging, which is mostly only an issue for the monitor developers.

The implementation is how the logic design implements the architecture.
The KA, KI, KL, and KS had very different implementations.

Even within an implementation, there can be large differences in the
realization, which is how the logic is physically implemented.  For
instance, the IBM 709 and 7090 had the same architecture and implementation,
but the realization was tubes for the 709 and transistors for the 7090.

I was told at one point, that LCG kept the 11/40 in production for their
own purposes long after it was dropped as a separate product -- true?
They certainly seemed to have their own silk screen for the front panel
(which was remote mounted on the short+fat 20s).  I've heard of 11/34s
being used as FEs, my impression was that that was done in the field though,
anyway the nice thing with the 11/40 is the non-volatile switch register.

The RH20 is not *anything* like an RH11.  OK, the Massbus transceiver
modules are the same, but everything else is different.

The RH20 is *NOT* a Unibus device, and cannot be used in any way
on a PDP-11.  It plugs into dedicated slots of a KL10, and is electrically
part of the KL10 C bus and E bus.

If you have an RH20 with no KL10 to plug it into, the only use for it
is to send it to someone who has a KL10.  I volunteer.  :-)

It is my contention that there is no real difference between an emulator
and microcode.

The difference, such as it is, is that microcode tends to be written for a
platform that runs no other software, whereas an emulator is typically
written for a platform that runs a range of application software.
Microcode also tends to be the sole application running on the hardware,
wheras an emulator is often just a single process on a multiprogramming
platform or even a timesharing system.

I regard these differences as illusory.  There is no clear black and white
distinction.  I understand that KL10 hardware was once microcoded to
emulate an S/360.  Re-read the previous statement carefully...it proves my
point.

If you restrict "PDP-10" to those machines which implemented the
instruction set in hardware, then you'd be limited to the PDP-6, the KA10,
and the KI10.  Even then, the PDP-6 and KA10 used hardware subroutines
(and thus were easily hacked to add other instructions), and the KI10 had
somewhat of a proto-microcode.

The closest a KL got to modern processor tricks was memory pre-fetches.
JUPITER that got cancelled was meant to have more than one micro engine and
pipelined instruction fetch and execute. Some other non-DEC KL equivalents
IIRC did have pipelines there name escapes me ATM.

Thanks for the info, Joe, as well as taking the time to wander through
a rather long post. As always, you are very informative.

I had not seen that technique of running in the accumulators before
& think it is probably worthy of posting in alt.folklore.comp. 

Of course, today, with structured programming, self-modifying
code is frowned upon. Also, with the newer architectures, it
probably can cause ram cache misses and slow things up.

I'm thinking of going through my old Univac-1108 assembler stuff
to see if any equivalent technique as you described could occur.

At our company, around 1974-1983, we used our own version of the
the HP-2100 (micro-coded). We employed self-modifying code,
although very rarely. One example that comes to mind was a
shift or rotate command to properly normalize numbers for
subsequent multiplication to ensure that overflows didn't occur.

Of course, self-modifying code made for really fun debugging
sessions!  :)

Try 1952 until 1988.  DEC announced the cancellation in 1983, but new
hardware and software came out for 5 years thereafter.  In fact, there was
even a new KL10 variant.

So, 36-bits lasted 36 years.

Yes, "lasted" would be a much more appropriate term than "ruled". Have we 
forgotten that the late '50s and early '60s were "ruled" by byte oriented 
machines such as the IBM 1401 and it's various semi-clones (such as the 
Honeywell 200). Actually the term "byte" wasn't at that time used to describe 
this class of machines, they were contemporaneously refered to as character 
machines.

In the mid-'60s IBM introduced the 360 series, which spearheaded the trend 
toward 32-bit machines. By 1970, 32 bits "ruled".

The best that can be said of 36-bit machines is that they "ruled" a relatively 
small backwater of computing.

The first Lisp was actually done on an IBM 704...*not* an IBM 7090...
although *older* versions of the Jargon file said the 7090. I have it on
*very* good authority that the first Lisp was done on the IBM 704.

No, not usually on KL-10s.  User-accessable DECtapes were ubiquitous on
KA and KI but somewhat rare on KL.  (The DECtapes that were attached to
the console front-end were NOT assessable via the MOUNT command.)

The Colorado School of Mines had a couple hundred student-owned DECtapes
in the library when we upgrade from a KA to a KL + KS.  Because we were
keeping a lot of the KA peripherals, we ordered a KL-1091 with I/O-Bus
adapter, and two TU55 transports.  We ran into a couple of problems
getting DTB defined (no problem with just a single DECtape controller; DTA).
I ended up disassembling the DECtape formatter program, adding mnemonics
to the re-created source, and defining a feature-test for DTA vs DTB.

If they are 2 wide 'corp cab' vax like, then he has everything.  THe
RHs are in the IO box, above the 11/40, as is the DTE.  The Memory, if
it is MF or MG, is at the back of the IO cab.  If it is MA... core,

DEC in there infinite wisdom initialy would only ship MOS to 20s. We
went through this with the UWA KL. They LENT 512K of core, until they
changed the availabiliy... Would not even come at shipping a '20' to
run Tops-10...

That's certainly not true of the 2060s and 2065s I've seen, they definitely
had three corporate cabinets, and the DTE20s, RH20s, and memory are in
a separate cabinet from the 11/40.

I suppose it's possible that the 2040 might have fit in two cabinets.
The 2040 didn't support the DMA20 memory interface.  DIA20 I/O bus
interface.  If they also reduced the number of supprted DTE20s and
RH20s, and only allowd for one memory box, and didn't have a BA11
expander on the 11/40, I can see how they might have just barely squeeze
that all into two cabinets instead of three.  However, I'm pretty sure
my 2040 print set shows a three-cabinet configuration.

Yes, the DTE20s, RH20s, and the optional DIA20 and DMA20 do in what
I call the "I/O Controller" cabinet.  I'm not sure if there's a more
official name for it.

This is NOT the same cabinet that houses the PDP-11/40 front end.

Not yet.  I'll be trying to set up the DECSYSTEM-2065 later in the year.
Since it already has working MG20 memory, the need to build a board is
less urgent, but I'd still like to do it.  If I do, I'll probably use
a Xilinx Spartan II FPGA for control and ECC, and synchronous SRAMs
for the memory.  The objective is to make the memory operate as fast
as the KL10 can handle.

The front end cabinet of a KL10-C, -E or -R (corporate cabinets)
contains the 11/40, a BA11 expansion box, the RX01 dual floppy drive,
and the power control.  I think in some configurations there may
also be MF20 memory boxes in this cabinet, though I'd have to dig
out the MF20 installation docs to check.

The BA11 expansion box is presumably present because it was expected
that all the unit-record equipment and at least some of the
terminal muxes would be on the front end Unibus, whereas on the
tall-cabinet KLs (the 1080 and 1090) such things were on the KI I/O
bus (attached to a DIA20).

Ah, I forgot the BA-11... I tossed several DHs and shoehorned one into
the 40 cab. No need for the BA :) Hell, 32 lines is plenty for home!

The 11 only booted off floppy as a last resort ( in troubleshooting

I thought the DEC-20's were two units wide, and about 5' high,
but each unit had two standard 19" wide rack mount units.Don't
know about 10's, though. I thought they were 6' racks, each of
which contained one 19" rack.

Again, for 20's, they ran on three phase 208 volts, slightly non
standard. But that's 208 volts phase to phase. Voltage from phase
to neutral is 208/SQRT(3), (ask any *real* electrical engineer
about 1.732, i.e. SQRT(3)) which is 120 volts, standard house
voltage (but as you say, lots of current to feed the ECL).

KL-10, B, C, and Ds where in Full height 19"racks. The KL-10E and
KL-10RE, aka 1091 and 1095 where in double width corp cabs.  Mine are
distinctly BLUE. Well, the tops and fan trims anyway...

The power is meant to be direct connected. I dont even want to think

In the US they commonly have a fairly massive Hubbell pin-and-sleeve
connector.  This is the next step up from the more common twist-lock
connectors.  In the case of the KL10-E, I think what they're using
is a 4P5W (four pole five wire) 60A 3-phase 120/208V connector, Hubbell
part number HBL560P7W or C560P9W plug.  These plugs are about 113 mm in
diameter and 254 mm long.

These connectors are in section F of Hubbell's catalog, which used to be
available online in PDF format at
	http://www.hubbell-wiring.com/
but it appears that they're revising section F in the online catalog.
Some of the material is available in individual data sheets in their
PDF Data Library section.

They conform to international standards IEC 309-1 and IEC 309-2, which
specify a different pin configuration for every combination of number of
poles, voltage, and current.  So there should be a suitable connector
for any supported KL10 configuration worldwide.

I haven't priced these yet; I'll have to contact my local distributor,
Bell Electrical.

Three cabinets.  Only the front end cabinet uses standard 19" rack
mount.

The earlier KL10s as used in the DECsystem-1080 and 1090 (but not the
1091 and 1095) are in 6' cabinets.  Two of the cabinets are 23" racks,
and one (the front end) is 19".

I assume that you mean "slightly non-standard" with respect to single
phase "220 volt" power (which can be 220-240 volts).  "220 volt" power
involves two "hot" 110-120 volt (with respect to neutral) wires, at an 180
degree AC phase difference from each other, instead of a "hot" and a
neutral.

208 volts is, of course, perfectly standard for three-phase, which has
three "hot" 110-120 volt (with respect to neutral) wires at a 120 degree
AC phase difference from each other.

A "208 volt" peripheral is one which expects to use two wires of a
three-phase power source, but is not three-phase.  It will work on a "220
volt" power source, but the excessively hot voltage will presently fry the
power supply unless it's of relatively modern manufacture.

There are instructions in the RM05 service manual for how to rewire the
power supply to 220-240V.  I don't know if it's possible for TU77s or
TU78s.

The RP06 is an actual three-phase device.  Not that anyone with any sense
would actually use one, but if there is, I have a working RP06 drive free
to anyone who will come and haul it out of my garage.

I used to think so too, and someone here corrected me.  Sure enough,
a look at the prints reveals that it actually only uses two phases out
of the three.  The power chained to a second attached drive uses a
different pair, i.e., if the main drive uses phases A and B, the
second drive uses A and C (or B and C).

Also, the power section of the maintenance manual reveals that the
drive will work on 220-240V rather than 208V, with no change.

In summary, it should be easy to wire up an RP06 to run on a single-phase
240V circuit, as is commonly found in US residences for electric ranges
and clothes dryers.

I was sure it was a 3 phase motor, plus a fair lump extra for the
electronics from one phase. RP07s are seriously 3 phase. Like about
70A/ph start current!

Time to brave the Styx on go looking for the 667 manual. And the PR07
one. Ah Sperry 8470 service manual. No sign of the 667 one yet...

Actually, the RP05/6 and DCL are using two real phases.  RP04's were three
phases. The third phase was included to allow daisy chaining two RP06
together with one power lead and a special RP06->RP06 cable (which I've
done ONCE at DEC Field Service) in cases where there were less than the 
needed number of connections under the floor.  

Two phases were used by each drive -- the RP06 used a two phase motor
which would not have the propensity to spin backwards like the RP04
when plugged in to a three phase outlet wired by the site electricians.

As sold, it is called an NIA20.  It's an Ethernet interface that replaces
two RH20s (numbers 4 and 5, IIRC).  The CI20 interface also replaces two
RH20s (numbers 6 and 7, IIRC).

> It uses IPA20 interface (is reserved for 564 (KNI) and 574 (CI).

Sounds like they are using "IPA20" as a name for the three-module set
that goes in the RH20 backplane (M3001, M3002, M3003).  In an NIA20, this
connects to a box containing an LI0072.  In a CI20, it connects to a box
containing multiple modules, and I don't recall the module IDs.

Maybe "IPA" stands for Intelligent Peripheral Adapter or some such.
It has a bit-slice processor into which the KL must load microcode.

The last figure I knew was $40,000/year for the KL ($20,000/year educational
discount)--the price was lowered just after we had sent in our $120,000 for 3
systems at LOTS, so we got two years' support for that payment.

There were more than a dozen in use internally when I left.

2476

I thought it was also the ARPAnet TOPS-20 development system as well,
but recently someone here with a knowledge of where the various cards
and options were installed said they doubted that a 1091 could have
BOTH an external memory controller (DMA20) *AND* a KI10 I/O bus
adaptor (DIA20) which would have been required to talk to the IMP
interface...

Do you mean PDP-10 I/O bus (TD10) connected DECtapes?
Of _course_ they had them on their front ends!

	Anything with a serial number below 2100 (or so) was
	manufactured as a 1090 (or 1080), in bright blue "high boy"
	(rack height) cabinets, with "external" core memory that had
	multiple ports, and could be used for SMP.

	The higher range were either 2040/2050/2060's (orange) or
	1091's (a paler blue), in "corporate" (VAX height) cabinets,
	with "internal" semiconductor (MOS DRAM) memory.

	2065's (and 1095) were manufactured in the FCC RFI safe boxes
	(designed for Jupiter) were any of the FCC cabinets blue??

I remember the Venus (8600) project had some 2060's they used for
development (wrote code to handle net lists in extended addressing
FORTRAN), but they don't seem to appear on the list (it's possible
they were absorbed by 36-bit engineering, and DO appear). The Jupiter
microcode people had a system "IO - One of Jupiters Moons" -- I
suppose that could have been #2530...

There is an image of a PDP10 with DECtapes at: 
http://starfish.rcsri.org/rcs/DECsystem/1090/hybrid.jpg

This machine was originally a KA10 and eventually turned into a KL10 1090.
Most of the original KA10 peripherals were used on the KL10, including the 
DECtapes.

The 1091 I/O bay backplane probably doesn't have any slots for the DMA20,
since internal memory was standard on those.  It should have room for
a DIA20 (or DIB20?) KI10 I/O bus adapter.

As I understand it, just the backplane.  The functionality is identical.
This is what I've pieced together from various documentation, so it could
be wrong; I haven't found any really definitive reference.  

In the I/O bay of the processor, the 1080 and 1090 have a backplane that has
room for the DMA20 memory bus interface (only needed with external memory
such as the DEC M[ABDEFGH]10 core memory or Ampex ARM10 semiconductor
memory) and a DIA20, both of which are standard.

The 1091, 1095, 2060, and 2065 instead have mounting space for a
backplane that only has room for the I/O adapter, which is optional
(possibly standard on the 1091 and 1095, the documents are
inconsistent).  The I/O adapter with backplane is called a DIB20.

Other than the machines listed here, does anyone have a more complete
list of KL10-x owners? I'm especially looking for other 2060/2065 owners.
Paul Allen's machines would-be museum machines don't appear to be listed
here;)

I have found most KL10 collectors to be very private. I have sent many emails 
asking for information on collector's machines and have received only a few 
replys. I would appreciate any help that you can provide to improve the list.
