Look in the section "Developers, DECUS, People";

There's also a photo of Jim Flemming (JMF) and Tony Wachs (TW) in
front of a 1091 (KL10 in a short blue cab).

look down to 1978 for the 2020.
many photos.

There's a photo of the PDP-6 team.  I know I have hardcopies (one in a
DEC newsletter, and one in a glossy anniversary brochure I got Alan
Kotok to sign at his DEC retirement dinner).

I just put up a PDP-10 page of my own at www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/
which includes the entire LCG organization, taken on the 20th
anniversary of 36-bit systems (1984) and other tidbits I've collected.

I have some notes that must have come from some publication made that
year;

PDP-6 development team;

Harlan Anderson, VP of Eng
       Gordon Bell, System Architect
		Alan Kotok, Asst. Architect, Logic Designer
			Russ Doane, Circuits
			Ken Senior(?), Field Service
			Bob Reed, Technician
			Leo Gussall(?), Diagnostics
		Dit Morse, Software Project Leader
			Tom Hastings, Dave Gross; Monitor
			Harris Hyman, Steve Pinar; MACRO
			Tom Eggers; DDT
			Bell Segal; Utilities
			Peter Sampson, Al Blackington; FORTRAN
			Ed Yourdon (yep, that one); LOADER

[Ironicly, I was working for Al Blackingington at the time, who had
returned to DEC, to work on .... FORTRAN!]
