[begin story]
[Version 0.4]
;Edit 0.4  Fix typos and change to 1 + 1 = 0.8

Once upon a time there was a company affectionately
called DEC that attracted and hired productive people.  
Instead of tying their efforts down with rules and 
paperwork, this company encouraged its people to think 
and create.   It allowed people to do real work.  We 
made fine stuff and we made money selling that stuff.   

Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) was a tightly coupled 
system architecture that allowed any CPU to do any task,
as opposed to a master/slave architecture.  TOPS-10
SMP had few exceptions, such as setting the time at 
system startup.  To indicate that this was a new 
software design, the major monitor version number 
that implemented this architecture was incremented 
from 6.xx to 7.xx.  We called this monitor, the piece of
the operating system that was always resident in core,  7.01.

Our customers first saw SMP as V7.01.  The fact that 
they ever saw it is a testament of the high regard 
that DEC had for two men, James M. Flemming (JMF) 
and Antony Wachs (TW); a respect that was eliminated 
in a company known as Digital.  This is the story
of what happened, based on personal observation
and what was told to me by JMF and TW.


Sometime, during the 6.03 development cycle and the advent
of the KL10 CPU, Jim noticed that the speed of service to
users was not very good.  After we shipped 6.03, Jim did
his usual "stare at the SYSDPY" displays and created a
performance data base (I think with the help of CDO) for
further performance analysis.  SYSDPY was a program
that displayed static and variable system data on a video
terminal; Chuck O'Toole did some of the formatting of
SYSDPY and also wrote a FORTRAN program that
analyzed the data ??is this correct, Chuck??

What he found absolutely floored him.  When one added a
second KL10 CPU, one did not get twice the service; his
analyses showed that one only got 0.8 the expected 
performance.  He made slides and gave a talk about this
for DECUS stating that 1 KL + 1 KL = 0.8 KLs.  Now, if 
there was anything that TOPS-10 developers couldn't stand, 
it was degradation of performance.  JMF and TW worked 
the 3:00-12:00 shift so they could have the PDP-10
systems stand alone, and probably started to talk
about improvements during those wee small hours of 
the A.M. when not much else was going on.  Since
I was working on the accounting project in another
part of the building, I couldn't listen in on all of
their brainstorming sessions.

I remember JMF had to work really hard to convince
TW that bit-diddling the master/slave implementation
wouldn't give the performance improvements that JMF
wanted.  He firmly believed that adding another CPU
to a configuration should give the system a 100%
increase of work, not 80%.  Hence, SMP was born.

There was a flurry of activity.  The tasks that had
to be done in order to implement SMP were written on
the backs of unpunched IBM computer cards.  Keeping
lists and marking changes in listings was the best
use of cards in DEC's opinion.

One of those tasks was to make each device driver 
reentrant so that the code could be run at any time
on any CPU; the data and the code had to be separated.
The two men split up the work by negotiation.   
One of those negotiations was deciding who would do 
FILSER, the file service routines.  As a result of those 
negotiations, Jim was obliged to do a lot of device drivers 
just so Tony would do FILSER.  In those days, nobody 
touched the disk service routines without great trepidation, 
lots of magic incantations and the blessings of TW who,
at the time, was considered the father of TOPS-10 due to
his longevity in the group. Jim didn't want any part of the 
file system work.  I don't remember how they decided who 
would do SCNSER, the terminal I/O module, since
neither one wanted any part of that piece of TOPS-10.
I suspect that there was probably a wish for RCC (Bob
Clements) to come back but, instead, we managed to 
hire somebody.  This was an accomplishment since the 
part of the PDP-10 development budget alloted to TOPS-10 
was very, very small.

I remember that Jim would use his weekend work time to 
make device drivers such as DTASER, the DECtape device
driver, reentrant.  Jim always  went into work Saturday and 
Sunday mornings but he only did "fun stuff" on the weekends,
his play time. 

Those development days were lively with laughter,
fights, ups and downs.  A big up was the day that
the guys got the monitor to print its dot after TW
ran his macroes over the sources; we used this major
code adjustment time as an opportunity to get rid
of all the feature test switches that had become
a pain in the ass.  There were just some things  
that we didn't want customers to be able to turn
on and there were some things that we didn't want
customers to turn off.  These feature test switches 
were an archaic legacy of DEC's support commitments. 

A big down was the day that the guys finally figured
out the reason for a particular set of crashes was a
race condition caused by the KL not having a write-thru 
cache.  That was a time when the guys thought that 
they wouldn't be able to ever implement SMP; if a solution
wasn't found, we had to can the project.  Jim finally 
got the idea of the spin-lock mechanism to solve that
problem.  JMF and TW were told many years later that
this could have been patented but the lawyers decided
it wasn't worth the trouble since the sources had
been shipped.  Back in those days, if the sources
were shipped, the thinking was that the contents
was public domain.  That thinking changed but I
don't remember why (if I ever knew).

The development cycle had reached the stage when Jim
and Tony were ready to talk about the product at Spring 
DECUS, 1978. ??I think this is the correct year but would
like some verification??
We did all the preparations for the talk.  I was the one
who did all the overheads and, believe me, getting JMF
to keep those slides readable was an effort.  We attended
the party-line talks; these were the pre-DECUS meetings 
where the product managers told us what we could talk
about, and, more importantly, what we couldn't talk
about.  It one wanted to go to DECUS, one had to attend  
one of these party-line sessions.  We were to find out
later that these sessions were not complete.

Jim and Tony were very excited about telling the TOPS-10 
customers about SMP.  In those days, the corporate climate 
with respect to TOPS-10 was not good.  We felt like we were 
being attacked from all sides so the anticipation of 
presenting a really good idea to our customers was 
important to them.

Jim and Tony did their talk about SMP.  Then we went
to the product panel session.  Jim and Tony sat together
towards the front of the room.  I sat three chairs down
from our manager, Chuck Turley; the chairs between Chuck 
and me were vacant.

The product manager, Dave ?????, gave the presentation.  
One of his slides said that 6.04 was the last TOPS-10 
monitor.  I can't begin to describe the impact that 
that slide had on the audience.   After some questions, 
one customer asked, "Is 6.04 the last TOPS-10 monitor?" 
Dave said, "Yes."  The same customer then asked, "Is SMP 
in 6.04?"  Dave said, "No."

I asked Chuck if he knew that this was coming.  He nodded
his head miserably.  I said, "Do you understand what 
that implies?"   Again, he nodded his head.  I said,
"Did Jim and Tony know about this?"  He shook his head.
I said, "Why didn't you tell them?"  He said, miserably,
"We didn't know how to tell them."

The meeting broke up shortly after that.  I sought out
Jim and Tony and we retired to a nook in the bar.  I
didn't know how to comfort them; I was in shock myself.
I must digress here for just a minute to mention that
most of the customers left us alone in our misery.  I
would like to thank them for that small gesture of
understanding.  We didn't want to hobnob just then.

[As a warning to the reader, I would like to make one
thing clear before I continue.  TW was the only person
in the whole world throughout all time that was allowed
to call me Babs (he pronounced it Bobs); Jim never even 
tried.  So, just because it's now in print, does not mean 
that it will be permissable to call me that name.]

At one point, Tony asked, "What are we going to do, Babs?"
He had such a lost look on his face that I told him the
truth.  I said, "Fuck'em."  You see, I was pissed; I 
was livid; I was beyond expressing my anger and disgust
with the way these guys had been treated by our management.
How dare they not tell Jim and Tony what was being planned.
How dare they let Jim and Tony go to DECUS and talk about
SMP, giving the customers the idea of a hint of deceit
and the impression of ineptness.  How dare they allow 
Jim and Tony to embarrass themselves because of their
[the managers'] cowardice?  I was furious.  And, 
besides that, they were cancelling TOPS-10 which was a 
revenue backbone of Digital Equipment Corporation.  
So, back to the bar scene.

I said, "Fuck'em."  Tony said, "Yea.  Yea.  YEA.  FUCK'EM".
Then Jim said, "You know, TW, I always wanted to
have a calling card that said, 'Have EDDT, will travel'.  
One of my favorite TV shows was _Have Gun, Will Travel_
and I always thought that the slogan 'Have EDDT, will
travel' was sexy."

Tony got a thoughtful look on his face and the guys
started talking about a business where their expertise
in debugging and developing TOPS-10 could be exchanged 
for money.  We started planning then and there.  SMP 
would be delayed for a while but the game plan was to 
get a customer to allow us to use their hardware so 
that further development could continue; we had our 
eye on the ORNL site for that.  Since Jim and Tony 
both had families, a source of income was required.  
We figured that plenty of customers would want them 
to solve their problems.  We figured that we
wouldn't have to advertise; word-of-mouth would be 
sufficient.  My part would be to take the phone calls,
handle the scheduling, and be responsible for the 
financial end of the business.  If anything else came
up, I would handle that, too.  Picking up all the loose
ends was already one of my functions at DEC.  On top of 
that, I would keep my job with DEC and garner lists and 
information about customers with problems.  Then 
Tony said he had to go home (his beer limit was two).

I do not know what was said in the early morning
sessions that JMF and TW must have had.  That Friday, 
JMF and TW agreed that we all go away and think about
the proposal and talk with the wives.  A meeting with
the wives was set for that next Sunday night at TW's 
house.  It was agreed that, if even one person voted
nay to the proposal, we wouldn't go ahead with it.

Meanwhile, I had to figure out how I could answer my
phone at home (my personal phone number was going to 
be the customer contact) while I was working in Marlboro.
I started to think about the financial aspects of running
a business.  Neither Jim nor Tony knew the rudiments of
business management.  Jim didn't know how not to spend
money, and Tony didn't know how to spend money.  I
quailed at the thought of having to argue business
sense to either of these men.  I began to have my
doubts about the success of this business venture.

Then I thought about the impact of my saying nay on
these two men.  I didn't want to hurt them; a vote
of nay would crush them.  It was conceivable that I
would lose their friendship.  It was guaranteed that
I would get undercut at work.  I took the coward's 
way out and decided to vote last.  If one of the
wives said nay, I wouldn't have to vote.

We had the Meeting With the Wives that Sunday night; 
Jim and Tony gave it this title. After a lot of 
discussion, it was time to vote.  The wives voted yea.  
Tony and Jim voted yea.  Then they all looked at me and 
I wanted to melt through the virtual hole in the floor.  
With a sinking feeling, I voted nay.  Jim and Tony were
shocked.  I gave them my reasons saying that I didn't
think that we knew how to run a business.  After
a little more discussion, TW ended the meeting saying
there wasn't anymore to be said.  I went home.  Tomorrow
was Monday, another work day.

That next morning, JMF and TW got together to talk
again.  I don't know what they said; I didn't really
want to ever know what they said.  They did decide
to go to their manager and told me so.  I said, "If
I were you, I'd go to the top and not waste a damn
second on middle management."  TW suggested the next
level up.  I suggested they start with Ken.  JMF
and TW comprimised and got an appointment with the
head guy of LCG (I don't remember his name and
would appreciate help with this one).

Those were two very nervous people.  They didn't tell 
anybody about the meeting (their normal habit would have
been to tell at least the supervisor).  They spent their
time drinking coffee (which didn't help nerves), walking
around, and fussing.  These men never fussed.  Finally,
the late morning meeting happened.

They sat down with this guy and told him about the 
"6.04 is the last TOPS-10 monitor" announcement.  
The guy said, "Yea, so?"  Jim and Tony said, "What
do you plan for us to work on after 6.04?".  Jim
and Tony proceeded to tell him that they were 
seriously thinking about leaving DEC.  

Now, apparently, that thought hadn't crossed management's
mind when planning this outrageous announcement.  I 
can't explain the idiocy; there are times when people 
just don't make sense to me and this was one of those
times.  The managers (those directly above Jim and Tony) 
who did think this thought, didn't say anything.  The 
politics of getting rid of TOPS-10 were very thick and 
tricky then.  So silence was the easiest and safest 
course to take at that time; I understand this thinking.

After that meeting, as TW would say, the fit hit the
shan.  It was not a goal to lose Jim and Tony.  At
that time, there were still people who were aware
that the products these guys produced made money.  I
do know that somebody pointed out that most of the
budget for TOPS-10 involved Jim and Tony.  If
they were going to be funded anyway, they might as
well do something like SMP (they were not welcome 
in the -20 group and they did not want to work on TOPS-20).  
So, to keep these two men as employees, DEC turned the 
TOPS-10 SMP project back on.

From that time on, I did everything I could to smooth
the efforts of the TOPS-10 monitor group in my spare
time.  That work involved from being a sounding board
at design sessions to getting cups of coffee for the 
guys during intense debugging efforts.  It was an 
interesting time; it was an exacting time; it was
hell; it was heaven.  It was frustrating; it was 
satisfying.   It was rarely boring; it was life.

When Tony Wachs died, I cried for three days and three 
nights.  Then, for three months after that, I cried 
whenever Jim wasn't around because he didn't like to see 
me cry.  When Jim Flemming died, I cried for two years 
and a month.  These men were my best friends.  I still 
miss them.

Barb, I really enjoyed your missive. As you know I was close to both TW and 
JMF. I shared an office with Tony as early as 1966, and actually interviewed 
Jim when he was looking to join DEC. Jim and I subsequently shared an office 
soon after he came to Maynard.

I left DEC (and the TOPS-10 Monitor group) an 1974 to take a job with First 
Data; subsequently acquired by ADP. By 1978 (the era you discussed), ADP was 
busy creating a product based upon the KS-10. We were a TOPS-10 shop and it 
was abundantly clear that DEC placed no importance in supporting TOPS-10 on 
the KS. Through my inside contacts (TW and JMF) I learned that although DEC 
was promising ADP a KS version of TOPS-10, no one was actually working on it.

Over the period when we (ADP) were negotiating and working closely with DEC to 
get TOPS-10 implemented on the KS, TW and JMF were bringing SMP to fruition. 
As our (ADP Network Services) entire business was based upon TOPS-10 (and as 
the largest TOPS-10 shop then extant) we were VERY concerned about what we 
perceived to be a lack of serious committment to TOPS-10.

Think about it; here was DEC's largest single 36-bit customer negotiating to 
buy over one hundred KS-10s; and DEC is clearly not committed to the operating 
system upon which we totally dependent. Not very far-sighted thinking, was it?

Seeing the handwriting on the wall, we proposed buying TOPS-10 in total from 
DEC, a proposal they took seriously. We actually had a number of meetings on 
the subject. High on the list of concerns was the disposition of personnel, TW 
and JMF included. Had this gone to completion they might have just ended up 
being employees of ADP.

In the end, common sense prevailed at DEC and a re-committment was made to 
TOPS-10; at least in the short term. We were never privy to DEC internal 
thinking, we just found out that at some point TOPS-10 was off the table.

It was probably during this period of corporate schizophrenia that the 
infamous "6.04 is the end of the line" pronouncement was made. Had DEC stuck 
to that policy ADP would probably have acquired the rights to TOPS-10 and 
continued its development.

I'm pretty certain that at some point over the intervening years I shared that 
story with TW and JMF, but don't know if it ever received wide distribution. 
I'd be curious to know if either of them ever shared it with BAH.

Don't know how Don would have done that. All it took was a shared memory

The weird idea was that we could use it to make money. It wasn't until I 
joined First Data (soon acquired by ADP) that I learned how little DEC 
understood about the commercial use of a PDP-10. DEC's TOPS-10 accounting 
software was clearly designed for an academic environment because it was 
woefully inadaquate for commercial use. Over the years I was with ADP it was 
clear from my discussions with my old friends at DEC that they never really 
understood the reasons for multiple billing algorithms.

At ADP we were businessmen first and technologists second. Note that ADP 
continues its unprecedented record of earnings per share growth (longest in 
the history of the NYSE), while DEC no longer exists.

One of the flavors of 6-level monitors supported KLs.  However,
they ran master/slave and turned out to be, IIRC, slower than
master/slave KI when comparing actually work getting done.

Yea.  Looking back on it now, we quickly got used to reconfiguring
systems on the fly for stand-alone, field service, etc.

Just for clarification, 1025 wasn't the "other" CPU.  It was
1042.  1025 was the hardware engineering CPU.
