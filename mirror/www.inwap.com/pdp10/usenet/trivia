Ok,  gang,  It's trivia time!
Here we go:

Easy:
	Compuserve IDs are two numbers separated by a comma.  The digits 8 and 9
	are never used.  Why?

Medium:

	What is the common bond between the PDP-10, the animated cyber flick TRON,
	and the book of Revelation in the Bible (New Testament)?

Hard:

	When Digital first made the unfortunate announcement about the future of its
	line of 36 bit computers,  I made up the following comment:

		732777964

	What does this mean?

	I was able to re use this commentary in the early months of Bob Palmer's intendancy.
	When I posted it in the "Digital Culture" notesfile on the e-net, I included some hints.
	Within minutes there were responses that indicated they knew the answer.  Fortunately,
	the responders were so cool that they figured out a way of providing convincing evidence
	that they knew the answer without spoiling the fun for other readers.  Maybe you'll do 
	the same.

	I'm leaving the hints out this time, to increase the challenge.

Enjoy!

Yes, way too easy. [10,77]<-- My PPN while at DEC. Yes, I picked it because 
it was the highest two digit programmer number possible for those of us in 
the "10" group.

bearing licence plate PDP-8 only to discover that, in the Garden State, PDP is

TW's starting date was 6/6/66; I remember telling him (when he left 
DEC) that he would be back with DEC on 8/8/88 but that didn't happen.

TW was my second-best friend and I would like to read your stories.   Part 
of the culture of the PDP-10 and TOPS10 was integrally based on the 
philosophies and personalities of JMF and TW. I also have a few stories 
that I would like to tell.

Chuckle.  I remember that!

When asked a question he couldn't answer (or didn't want to answer) he 
would say, "Because ice cream has no bones."

At his going away from DEC party, we gave him an RP02 platter with those 
words incribed on it.

It's at several locations; one is <http://earthspace.net/jargon/jargon_toc.html>.
A search at Yahoo turns up several others, in the event that this one is

AFC has a FAQ?

If not, I'd suggest that the Jargon File be adopted as the FAQ.  It already
covers much of the ground that an AFC FAQ would.
