A couple months ago I was asked, "Why did I want TOPS10 on my PC?"  I
started to put together a paper and include it in this message.  It is not
complete but I would like to start a dialogue about the subject.  I have
been out of the business for a few years and would like to learn the areas
where my knowledge has lapses.

Let's get back to the subject...I was asked months ago (I've been ill and it
took a while to prepare the reply) why I wanted TOPS10 on a PC.  Following is
my answer:

I was asked what I wanted to accomplish by putting TOPS10 on a PC 
and if I had old code that required TOPS10 as an operating system.

It has nothing to do with old user code (although old customers might be
ticked pink if they could run their applications).  It has to do with the
power and versatility the software architecture of TOPS10 brought to
computing.  No other operating system (in my experience) has the complete
functionality w.r.t. user services that TOPS10 has. 

Not even JMF nor TW realized the beastie they had created when they did SMP.
As I had to explain to a hardware engineer at a "we shipped the xxxx" party,
SMP was the precursor to a computer concept that would allow one to do things
to a computer system without an interruption of service.  It might cause a
diminution of service while these things were going on, but it should never
cause a lack of service.  The analogy I used was the delivery of electricity
by the power companies.  One wouldn't dream of having an interruption of
electrical service while the power grid was being serviced--whether a new
turbine was being brought on-line (new hardware including another CPU), the
circuitry being checked out (on-line diagnostics), or repair work being
done.  This hardware engineer could not fathom a time when a computer system
would be so important that it couldn't be shut down from 17:00 to 8:00.

At the moment, I would like to be able to do simple things.  Printing an
ASCII file while I read a newsgroup immediately comes to mind.  GALAXY would
do that for me; GALAXY is an application service to the user and is far
ahead of anything that I know of currently in the market. In the immediate
future, I can envision doing a CPU-intensive research project while writing
this note and posting it.  I am unwilling to have a degradation of user
response; SMP would do this for me.

In the far future, I expect that a computer will be used to monitor the
functions of maintaining my environment.  Air quality is already an issue.
Heating/cooling should be a combined functional control.  Water potability
just became an issue this summer.  I can certainly envision a local computer
system doing the monitoring, treating, warning of danger.  SMP is a solution
because there can be failures (hardware or software) without an interruption
of service.  Granted, the implementation in TOPS10 doesn't solve all these
problems, but it certainly had a huge headstart on it.

Now, why have this functionality in a PC?  Because they are here. They are
cheap.  They are beginning to be designed such that upgrading isn't an issue.
I have three of them and I think I would like to have most of them tightly
coupled.  The exception to tightly coupled is the notebook that I could take
on a trip which could routinely inquire if everything is OK at home.

The possibilities are endless.  JMF did SMP on a number of OSs.  They each
have their strengths and they each have their weaknesses.  It is my opinion
that TOPS10 is currently the only available OS that has an extensive
catalogue of user services that need not be reinvented/reimplemented.  Hence,
I see running TOPS10 on a PC as a real solution and, by the way, quite
profitable to whomever owns the software.

I do grant you that, in today's concept of user interface, TOPS10 may be
considered primitive.  (As one who would much rather type than click, I
don't agree.)  But the point/click interface is only a momentary method.  A
couple years from now the norm will be voice.  It was only a few years ago
that data transfer from one computer to another was done with magtape;
before that DECtape; before that papertape; and before that, punched cards
(remember them? 026s and 029s).

(To be continued....)
