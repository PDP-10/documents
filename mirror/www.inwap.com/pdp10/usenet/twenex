The announcement is that twenex.org is now ready for public access.
During our testing in the past year we've had over 500 accounts created.
Oddly, most people were under the impression they could compile and run an
'eggdrop' IRC robot. So out of that 500, a handful of newbies and wizards
have stuck around.  (Though anyone is welcome to *try* to write a bot).

Now account creation is automated .. if you are interested in using the
system, you can telnet to twenex.org and login as 'new new' .. Information
as well as account creation can be found at http://twenex.org

When you create an account, you will have immediate access to email,
usenet (limited groups/retention), webspace, games, chat, compilers
and utilities.

The machine is hosted by the SDF public access UNIX system.

(aliases for this site are decsystem.org, sixbit.org & pdp10.org)
