Due to underwhelming demand for the 18b PDP's, and the fortuitous
discovery of a listing to PDP-1 LISP, I'd like to add the PDP-1 to the
Computer History simulators project.  Unfortunately, information on
the PDP-1 is scarce and contradictory.  I've worked from a 1963 DEC
handbook, and an online transcription of the 1964 handbook, but there
are still many questions not answered.  Help from people with prints,
documentation, and or long memories is appreciated.

In particular,

1. How was the "IO wait" feature implemented?  Was there one restart
pulse used by all I/O devices?  Or did each I/O device have its own
restart pulse?

2. IOT bits 5 and 6 were wait/signal completion.  Were they
independent?  Ie, 00 = totally asynchronous (test flag), 01 =
asynchronous wait (issue WAIT for IO later), 10 = synchronous wait
(wait for completion).  What did 11 do?  Wait and also signal
completion?

3. How was the "sequence break" (I/O interrupt) system implemented?

- The interrupt flags are, apparently, the bits in the I/O status
register as read by the check status instruction.  Was there a way to
clear an individual flag, or all the flags, other than issuing a new
I/O instruction?

- How was sequence break re-enabled prior to program return?  Was the
normal "enable sequence break" instruction deferred until the next JMP
indirect?  If not, what delayed the occurence of new interrupts after
re-enabling but before completion of the LAC, LIO, JMP I?

- What conditioned the JMP I to restore the OVerflow flags and Extend
mode flags at the conclusion of an interrupt sequence.  The handbook
describes a sequence much like the PDP-7's EMIR instruction, but no
instruction to set this up is described?

4. In the 1964 handbook, the shifts are described as arithmetic
shifts: preserving the sign on left shifts (and filling the sign from
the right), sign extending on right shifts.  Is this correct?  The
1963 handbook is silent.

5. In skips, bit<5> "inverts the sense of any skip instruction".  If
multiple skip conditions are specified, is the inversion applied to
the logical OR of the skip tests (as on the PDP-7 and PDP-8) or to
each individual skip prior to the OR?  Logic economization points to
the former, but the ISP program says the latter.

Please reply by email, as I don't check these newsgroups regularly.
