I liked working with RT-11.  It's philosophy was more like TOPS10
in that it just got the job done with a minimum of fuss and left

JMF called me his SO (I objected to this because it implied
I was only 2/3 an SOB :-) and I'm definitely a perfectionist).
I laid down very strict rules about when we were working.
Fortunately, he was smart enough to stick to them.

It's going to be a big adjustment.  JMF and I were split up twice
at work; he did not survive the last split since it took him out
of the TOPS10 group.

In my experience, some people get so hung up on who gets the
credit, nothing gets done.  IMO, all that energy spent on 
credit-seeking (or, in the case of who gets the blame, 
anit-credit-seeking) isn't spent on production.  Taking the
blame is simply short-circuiting all that energy back into
a production loop.

Nope.  It was an age-old tradition in TOPS10 (remember that
we shipped the sources to our customers) that the original
author of the source could put his/her full name in the
TITLE statement.  After that, in the SUBTTL statement, anybody
who modified the source put their initials to document an edit
trace.  So, it was not unusual for customers to see a long
string of /XXX/YYY/ZZZ.  Some people yearned to have their
initials in that line and others played the game of trying
to guess who's who.  Just about everything that I've done
at DEC since I started working there was indicated with 
my initials.  It's a long time habit.

Quite.  Although sometimes I long for those simpler days, there
are still things we have today and didn't then that I don't really
want to give up.  (Windows isn't one of those things!)  What would
the world be like if the PC's had RT-11 to start with instead of
DOS?  (Maybe not much better, given DEC's history...)

How many people think where we are today is 100% better than we
were 15 years ago?  (Given this group, I doubt anyone will say
100% better, but I bet most of us agree we are somewhat better,
and somewhat worse...)

That's what I'm worrying about mostly.  We'll survive monetarily, but
the stress it's placing on us is cause for concern.  I suspect it will
even out, but it's going to be hard for awhile.

I suppose.  I've been in the newsgroups so long that it's no different than
having a conversation at a party or in the office.  Of course we're kinda
off topic for A.F.C and A.S.PDP10 now...

Hmmm.  So your saying that taking the blame for something is
your way of just getting back on track that much sooner...  I
think I have too much ego for that, since I get angry and can't
function anymore if someone else's crap gets dumped on my head.
I'm never one to shirk my responsibilties, and I guess I expect
others to do that same.  I get steamed also when I see someone
I know is capabable of doing to work acting stupid, but in a
different way.

Interesting.  Since my name's so long, you'll find it listed
as CPC most of the time.  The 'P' doesn't stand for anything, but
I got tired of people asking for a middle initial that I decided to
mess with their minds a little.  It makes it symetrical in any case.

I wish companies still shipped source... The last source I got from
Digital was VMS 4.x, on microfiche.  I bought a reader just to look
at it.  As some people found out, I was WAY dangerous with source...
This is why I applaud all of the open source initiaitives that are
springing up today.  I have nothing against people charging for their
work, and nothing against copyrights and all that, but just the idea of
hiding the source like it's something mystical bothers me to no end.  Source
is PART of the project, the executables are another part.  When I'm working
on code today, I won't include modules into my projects if they come binary
only.  I consider it much to dangerous to do this, since everything else is
in so much of a hurry to "upgrade". (How often do you patch a MS OS?  We have
some software here that has been "broken" and required new LIB files almost
bi-monthly.  If we had the source, it would be just a matter of a recompile.)

There, I think we're back on topic now... :-)

Hey, Greg, did you know that you left the -20 side un-login-able with the
security hacks turned on?  I had to hack in through the monitor on the console,
to turn off password checking in the LOGIN% JSYS to use the system when I was
visiting Dick Greeley to pick up some of the software XKL licensed.

Stanford.)

Yep. You pretty much had to run 20F on TOPS-20 if you wanted to use those
DH11s for terminals.

>Wasn't there an RSX10F  or an RSX11F or something like that?


Not that I know of. When I worked at Energy Enterprises in the 80s we were
one of the few sites in the world had a RSX-20F source license. (We also had
a TOPS-20 source license but that was another story.)

20F came on a RP06, and it took something like 8 hours to build from sources
on an 11/40... At EE, system 2110 had two RP06s dual-ported to the 11 for
this purpose.

It was kinda cool that you could run timesharing on the KL while 20F was
building on the 11/40!

I recall from perusing the sources that 20F was actually based on RSX-11D
(not -11M, like you would think).

Wasn't some other 36 bit front end product (loosely) based on -11S?  Like a
DN92 or something? Anyone remember this?

The reason we had 20F sources was so that Dawn Banks could hack in DZ11
support. We wanted to run DCA 205s, which were DZ11 emulators, in the CFE.
The alternative was tons of DH11s talking to stat muxes. The source license
for 20F plus DCA 205s was cheaper than all of those

Dawn's code worked great (as always) but the hardware was a pain. Those 205s
had hardware problems, and DCA visted from Atlanta (Norcross) in order to
make them work. You couldn't have more than one in each Unibus expansion
backplane - there had to be several inches of Unibus between them - or they
locked up at random times under load. So we added a couple of 4 slot Unibus
backplanes to the first bay of each of the 11/40s.

We ran two or three 205s in each CFE, each CFE was configured for something
like 96 DZ11 lines. We ended up with a pretty big all-DCA network connected
up to five 2065s (and a 2020 with a 205, and a couple of 11/44s) by the time
it all came crashing down in the late 80s. (I'm sure it would have been all
ANF10 if we were running Blue, but we were an Orange shop.)

I think what Bill's suggesting is a cross-assembler, something that would take
a program written in MACRO-10 and port it to another platform.

It seems like more work than building a straight out emulator, then again, I
don't do much code (sorry, my favorite programming language is solder).

The relevant cross-compilers already exist for the higher-level languages used
on the -10, aside from maybe CRYPTIC - straight FORTRAN,  etc., where only
minor changes need be made in the source program to run on a different
machine.

But if it's look and feel and efficency of PDP-10 architecture you're after,
forget about it. OK, so I could probaly (given a source) run the original
FORTRAN Star Trek game on a Windows or UNIX machine, but it won't be like
running it under TOPS-10.

IMHO, if someone has the time and the programmable chips, the best emulator
would be a Micro-10 on a PCI board, with patches to make the attached WINTEL
machine act as terminals/storage devices, etc.

Then again, I'm STILL waiting for the ENIAC chip and board UPenn planned to
release about four years ago.

And time to turn an old -386 into a pseudo DECTape/DF-128/PTP/expanded
memory/Teletype for my Straight-8 (hell, I haven't even had the time to build
a "cradle" for the beast and make it a "desk-top" -8

two on my old collection of PD stuff I recently burned onto a CD-ROM.

If there is tremendous interest, I'll gladly post both MS-DOS versions I have

Don't forget the package of programs called MICRO.  The programs has MACRO-10
features because they used MACRO-10 as a cross-assembler.

It consisted of a series of macros written in MACRO-10.
It defined the pseudo ops for 8080/8085/Z80, 6502, 6800, etc.
You could run your microprocessor assembly-language program through
the 36-bit MACRO-10, then post-process the listing file to produce
an 8-bit punched paper tape for the target microcomputer.

IIRC, Sandy just used the age-old trick of putting a FM radio by the
computer.

That seemed a little obsolete to me.  At C-MU, circa 1973 the AI lab
built a 9 bit DAC as part of a PDP-10 peripheral used by the speech
recognition folks.  Others wrote a music editing system that displayed
on the ARDS (think Tektronix storage tube).  I helped out a little
with the assembler code in the registers that did the voice mixing
(think 4 9 bit bytes).  Someone else transcribed Scott Joplin's Maple
Leaf Rag.

Stanford Univ had a music group that worked on PDP-6 and PDP-10 well
before then.

Harvard had a 6 bit DAC created by tapping a PDP-1's console lights with
a resistor array.

I regressed myself a bit in my post-DEC days.  I joined a small company
that produced the first letter quality dot matrix printer (Sanders
Technology, not to be confused with Sanders Associates).  We had a PDP-11
and fortran, so I used TECO to create a font with 1/2" characters tuned to
over an octave, and another TECO program to convert a music description
language into the print file.  It had to handle bi-directional printing,
a space beteen notes, etc.  I think you might be able to find an account
I posted to USENET in pre-Web days that someone saved in a file that is
now HTML.

The first song I wrote was "A Bicycle Built for Two", the first song
ever _sung_ by a computer.  (Trivia question - where have most people heard
it?)  It was also a good choice, as our competition were Daisy wheel
printers.

	Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do!

	It won't be a stylish marriage,

I also did Christmas carols and played them over the PA system, and
La Marsellaise before a French customer came to visit.

Music on the PDP-6/10 predates this by some number of years. I recall 
working the DEC booth at SJCC (I think) at the Pru Center sometime around 
1967. Prominent features of the booth; The Teddy Bear (complete with freshly 
pressed bow-tie) and a recording of J.S. Bach's "Little Fugue in G minor" 
generated on the -6. It played over and over and over again. To this day as 
soon as I hear it I immediately think back to that show/conference. 

BTW, does there still exist anywhere the text of KO's (in)famous Teddy Bear 
memo?

Back in the early/mid '60s, there was a Teddy Bear prominently featured in 
the DEC booth at every trade show. I guess it was to symbolize the "cute and 
fuzzy" nature of DEC as opposed to Big Blue and the seven dwarves. After one 
such show, KO wrote an evaluation of the booth. He was particularly critical 
of the appearance of the bear, and wanted to make sure that someone took 
responsibility for brushing his fur and making sure his bow-tie (which I 
seem to recall was plaid) was freshly pressed before each show. Soon 
thereafter the bear disappeared into the annals of DEC history.

There was a series of DEC ads along this line with poetry.  The one I recall
(I think from an issue of Scientific American) went something like this:

    An Assistant Professor at State
    Grew attached to his PDP-8.
    When he tried to express it
    He was told to repress it
    For hugging might NOT an OR gate.

The version in 2001, I'm pretty sure, is the one from Max Matthews at
Bell Labs.  Am I confused, or did Ric copy Max, or vice versa, or is
this a remarkable coincidence?

Yes, that's what I had in mind.  I sent better comments back to Patrick,
becuse I thought he just Emailed me.  Post or Email, not both, please!

>The version in 2001, I'm pretty sure, is the one from Max Matthews at

I heard the Bell Labs effort while I was in High School, the movie 2001
came out when I was a freshman at C-MU (1968).  Fortunately I guessed what
HAL was about to sing.  If I hadn't, I probably wouild have burst out
laughing when the song started.  Given that was the most emotional point
of the movie, I might have given geeks a bad rap!

I copied Max - even if our competition's print elements were golf balls,
I would have had our dot matrix printer play Daisy.  The only other
possible song I would program first is "Doe, a deer", but only because
I don't need to look at sheet music to do it.

I always wanted to do Bach's "Little Fugue", with each printer carrying
a different line.  The only challenge in keeping things in sync would
be starting the data stream to all printers automatically.  I think the
printers started preparing the next pass while the head was finishing the
previous.

That was to keep people from spilling/dropping/fondling the console
switches.  All KA's came with one, I think.  CMU gave up on ours
pretty quickly.  The only time it would have been useful was when I
was an operator and one of the grad students was close to beating
Richard Greenblatt's chess program.  I was changing a DECtape and
accidentally dropped on a push button that crashed the system.  Rudi
was annoyed.  Quite annoyed, in fact.

I had no similar disasters until a day or two before I left for DEC
when I spilled a Coke on top of the line printer.  Fortunately, I got
that wiped up before it seeped through the hinge.

Jeez, it certainly took them long enough.  Jim had a chuckle
because, one day, DEC was talking about a deal with STC in
one end of the building (MRO) and talking about suing them
in the other end of the building.

Somebody sent me a story that Jim told but I can't verify or
deny it.

When the KL was first powered up, it blew the Marlboro

And you guys were in Marlboro then.  Hmmm. everybody was wrong
except you :-).  And I simply can't believe that we all did
all that work in such a short amount of time.  When I started
at DEC, July, 1971, the single KI had been announced; this was
greatly touted at my 25 year anniversary dinner by Palmer even
though he thought it was a 32-bit machine (he almost wore my
ice cream that night...I got really pissed).

In this case, one displays stuff that makes sense.  I just don't
think that the KL designers knew how useful (to everybody that
had anything to do with the machine) those lights were.  Even
Tape Prep girls knew when a system was in trouble by the lights
(or lack of clacking patterns) and they didn't know shit about
computers.

Both!  It's not a choice.  Both are interesting.

Maybe for the CEs it would be confusing, I don't know about that.  I do
know that a lot of lusers would some idea about how a computer
works (actually, it's more important that they know when it
doesn't work) if they had some kind of cue.  Sound is moderately
useful, but sight would be incredibly useful.  People learn
patterns imply certain things without knowing how to produce
the patterns.

Amusing, and slightly relevant, war story:

1) Operator reports "System is crashed!"
2) Look at KA console and observe that PI 4 is on hard. Recall that PI 4 is
unused.
3) Walk around machine room and observe LP10 (?, printer controller) with 4
in interrupt assignment register. Recall that it should be 5.
4) Power down LP10.  System resumes normal operation. Report dead bit in LP10
to field service.

Try that without lights.

Does anyone know of a source for TTY parts?  My ASR-33 typing element (the
drum with the actual type on it) is getting worn out.  The face of
characters on the upper two rows is getting flattened and it's getting
difficult to read.

Also, I bought rolls and rolls of printer paper about 10 years ago, but
I'm starting to run out.  Any source for the paper or tape?

Thanks in advance.

the printer ribbon is the same as an Okidata 93(?) pretty sure, but
I could have the model number wrong. For paper, tape, and parts, try 

Western Numerical Control
983 Golden gate Terrace
Grass valley, CA  95949
fax # 916  477-1917

they have a catalogue, tape supplies, splicers, rollers, refurbished stuff,
all kinds of junk. Not cheap, 'cuz they supply shops who still use the stuff
and have no choice - you know, supply and demand -- but trustworthy.

I got my '33 talking to a VAX RS232 port using this (comments taken from
the small MACRO routine used to set the port up at boot time, let me
know if you need it):

This worked well attached to a DHV11.  On the modem port of a MicroVAX
3100, it works, but the receive (from the ASR) is a bit dicey -- I
suspect I just need to adjust the value of the resistor between RXD and
DTR.

Failing that, B&B Electronics make a line of cheap, externally powered
RS232-current loop converters -- in fact I have one, but built the above
hack before it arrived, since I'd finally got the '33 (mostly) behaving
itself and was impatient to get it hooked up to something real...

There really isn't a hell of a lot on the 20mA interface to break... not
that doesn't get used with the machine in local mode, anyway.

Here's how I connect the the TTY to an RS-232 Port:

1.  Purchase a RS-232C to 20ma Current Loop Converter from Global Computer
Supplies.

2.  Hook the converter to the RS-232 Port using a null modem cable.

3.  Connect the "Receive" loop on the teletype to the "Input" side of the
converter.

4.  Connect the "Transmit" loop on the teletype to the "Output" side of
the converter.

5.  Set the RS-232 port as follows:  110 baud, no parity, 7 data bits, 2
stop bits

6.  Enjoy!

But that costs far more than the best method, which can be found in any
library with a collection of the early years of Byte in Ciarcia's column.
Rather than use the 2 resistor/1 diode method depicted, he isolated the two
sides with a pair of power transistors.

This should eliminate timing problems (assuming the serial port is set
properly) and prevent the nastiness that can occur if ever RS232 and 20 mA
should meet. (One of my pending projects is construction of a 60 mA current
loop and a driver to spit out Baudot for my RO-19 - bigger power transistors
should do the job)

As for the pin problem, take things apart with CARE that the working pins do
not shoot across the floor remove and rebuild non-working pin. Failure mode is
usually a damaged spring.

You might have heard it somewhere--I can't say--but if you heard it, it would
be wrong.

Both Gates and Allen were PDP-10 programmers at an early age, although Allen
did try to write an 8008 simulator on the Washington State System/360 at one
point.

Not a 12-bit system in sight.

Well, finally the thread on Bill G wandered onto a more interesting

My all time favorite -10 macro was originally written by
Bill Gosper, then at MIT-AI, and it solved the Rubik's
Cube puzzle. That is, the input to the compiler was the present
state of the cube and the output of the compiler was
the solution to the particular puzzle. This was, of course,
originally written in MIDAS-10 (MIT's assembler)
and not MACRO, but was quickly transliterated into
MACRO-10 where it worked just fine. The origin of
this was an ongoing competition at MIT-AI for who
could code a given task in fewer instructions. The
original Rubik's Cube solver at MIT-AI was in
LISP (what else?) and then somebody came up
with a very clever little routine that did the essential
rotations in a neat way, and then the whole
program got down to something like 40 instructions.
At that point Gosper went away for a day or so, then
came back announcing had a program which would
solve the puzzle in zero instructions!

My second favorite was the MACRO-10 macro
that compiled the hyphenation dictionary for the TYPESET-10
project. The macro was about six pages long
and the output was a hash-coded dictionary optimized
for fast access of common words, plus a routine that
added words to the dictionary on the fly and another
that would dump the dictionary into an ASCII format.
One neat thing about it was that the add-word and dump
routines weren't hard coded--they depended on the
density of the dictionary and suchlike for their hash
function, so the macro actually "wrote" the code anew
each time after the main dictionary was compiled and
ready for use. The disadvantage to all this was that
the hyphenation dictionary wasn't entirely expandable...
if you added several thousand words you'd have
to recompile for efficiency. But it sure was efficient when
you started.

    I'm beginning to think old LIRICS folks contribute about a quarter
    of the material to these newsgroups.

Heh.  I don't know if I quite qualify as a "LIRICS folk", but I probably owe
pretty much my entire current existance to LIRICS.  You see, my high school
used the LIRICS system, and I used it for my first computer class, which of
course used basic.  I discovered that people who "caught the bug" joined
LICUS, and so did I, eventually.  LICUS had neat things, and amoung them was
EMAIL (This was 1975 or so.)  EMAIL, I thought, was way cool.  I tried to
write an email program in basic, and it sort of worked.  But I couldn't turn
off the echo for getting the user's password in basic, and that led me off
on a multi-language chase that led eventually to Macro.  When I got to
college and THEY had a PDP10, I managed to call attention to myself after
re-keying in some LIRICS guy's somewhat sysdpy-like program, which led to a
job, and the ARPANet, and the path of no return....  All because of LIRICS
(and the assorted people and teachers at my highschool, of course.)

Yeah that's it -- the TS1000 was the same as the ZX81.  The ZX80 was an earlier

>What sticks in my mind most about it was the weird keyboard layout.

Forget the layout, that membrane keyboard *felt* horrible!  You couldn't
feel what you were doing even if you did know where the "keys" were, and the
"connector" (if you can call it that, stripped ends of flexprint cable IIRC)
to the PC board was flakey, at least on mine, so I kept having to take it
apart and reseat the cable just to keep both halves of the keyboard working.

The computer was utter crap, but I *am* grateful that mine happened to come
with some weird version of FORTH-78.  I couldn't get the stupid cassette to
load (did those things EVER work?!), but I later used the tiny manual as a
reference to write my own PC-DOS FORTH as a weekend project (I was taking
a class where they'd assigned us the ol' RPN calculator project, and I got
carried away), and then did versions (to the FIST FORTH-79 standard this time)
for RSTS, RT-11, TOPS-20, TSS/8, and finally my own stand-alone multi-user
FORTH OS for the PDP-11 (PDT-11/150 originally but then I extended it to
support RLs, RKs, DECtape, and it can autosize the DL11 TTY ports).  Now *that*
was a fun project, all because that P.O.S. Sinclair didn't work right!

The brother 100K and 200K disk drives for the tandy M100/102/Kyocera
KC85/Olivetti something-or-other/NEC 8201(a) had enough smarts that
you could load a routine into them and it would then find the os on
the disk and load it into the machine's memory.

The CBM C64 drives also had smarts that I think you could use to get
one drive to copy to another with no computer inbetween - after you
fiddled with it, of course.

Tymshare had a similar procedure for TYMCOM-IX (24-bit) programs and
TYMCOM-X (36-bit) programs.

1) Developer claims product is ready for release.  Provides
   a list of source files with checksums, and list of output files
   with checksums.

2) Program Librarians copy the files from the Development system to
   their computer.  Following the product's installation instructions,
   they recompile everything from scratch.

3) List of output files and checksums is compared with developer's list.
   If there are any descrepencies, go back to step 1.

4) Product is archived to tape, with three identical savesets per tape.
   First set of tapes placed in local tape library.  Duplicate set of
   tapes sent to off-site storage at the other end of the country.

5) Product installed on all production systems.

Nonstandard compilers were allowed, but only if adequately documented, and
if executable binaries for said compiler were included in the source
distribution.  The goal was to be able to recompile the product on
a system with only the standard utilities in the system directories.

Back when I worked in TOPS-20 engineering we used to patch the running
monitor on a regular basis.

After the repeated "downsizing" of LCG we ended up with one CFS cluster for
TOPS-20 7.0 development, one cluster which we shared with the TOPS-10 guys,
and awesome old KL1026/1042/1322 which was the TOPS-10 SMP system. There
were two KS10 systems but almost nobody used them.

Gidney, Cloyd, and Ronco, all of them 4 meg(!) 2065s were the primary
TOPS-20 systems in the MRO1-2 lab.

Gidney had the Arpanet IMP interface (tops20.dec.com), ran a lot of general
timesharing, and was about one monitor behind Ronco. Cloyd mostly did batch
jobs (monitor builds and other admin stuff). Gidney and Cloyd were pretty
busy during the day, running load averages in the 5-10 range. Ronco ("Now
how much would you pay?") was the main developer's system. We had about four
RP07s, each system had about 4 RP06s, and four HSC50s serving a whole bunch
of RA81s and two RA60s. The systems were ported to a string of TU73s using a
TX02/TX03. It was a kick ass cluster... those were the days...

There were only two KL systems for general monitor debugging: Chip and Dale
(actually MRCHIP and MRDALE) were in another CFS cluster with two more
HSC50s and were used for debugging. (These are the same two KLs that you may
have seen at DECUS.)

Chip and Dale were set up for serious standalone development. If you had a
serious patch you could be careful and put it into Chip or Dale, but if
someone had them signed up for standalone you would just have to (carefully)
patch Ronco. (Screwing around on Ronco was also good for keeping the load on
Gidney and Cloyd, as they had the reputation for being somewhat more
stable.)

Patching the running monitor was easy and fun, thanks to FILDDT... escape-<
to start a patch, escape -> to finish it.. when you finished it, DDT would
plug in the JRSTs for you. I'd run PHOTO first so I'd have a record of what
I patched (if the system stayed up).

If you blew it, you crashed the monitor and you had a dump to look at. If
you did it right and the system stayed up, you got a thrill, a patch all
ready for MONITR.EXE,  and the "C" part of an SDC file.

Of course patching the running monitor was always great for pranks on other
folks. Example: change a certain manager's username from DBROWN to *BDROWN*
and watch the fun after the connected path was set to ps:<*bdrown*>.

Fake ^ESENDs were also a blast, but that's another story.

Easy. Lots of things would break batch files if you weren't careful. Oh, and
I suppose there
can be some confusion about the term "batch" came to mean files that were
executed from a terminal pseudo-thing (PTY).

The primary ways of breakage were:

1)    Commands which were changed to do something differently, and wrong,
    (i.e. inconsistent with documentation) without giving error messages.
This
    was the killer, because the user generally wouldn't even know anything
was
    wrong but the output wouldn't be what was expected. For example, if a
copy
    command was supposed to format the output file in a certain way (and PIP
had
    many of these switches) but didn't, and another program read the output
file
    and checked for a certain string, then it could fail to work but appear
to. This
    made for wrong and inconsistent answers, which is less than desirable
for
    supposedly deterministic machines.

2)    Commands which didn't used to give an error message, but now did.
    This wasn't quite as bad, because at least if you read the log you could
    see something went wrong. Still, it wasn't great. And oftimes people
    wouldn't read the logs of programs that had worked reliably for
    years.

3)    Commands which did something differently than the documentation,
    and were corrected to conform to the documentation in the latest
    release. This is almost as bad as (1) but not quite, and particularly
nasty
    if the command is used as part of an automated process. Again, if the
next
    program searches for a particular string in the output file to check
whether
    the input data meet some condition, then one might never know that the
    programs had changed behavior.

I don't remember all the various switches for PIP, but there were quite a
few
and they could be used in odd combinations. PIP would also do various things
differently on different devices (device independence was as mythological as
the 40 hour work week at DEC LCG). One never knew what users relied upon,
so new versions had to work pretty much like old versions with respect to
all three of the above type of errors.

I remember when PTY's were implemented, because I'd come from MIT AI
where ITS had virtual terminals long long before, but I think that there was
card reader batch support well prior to PTY's, wasn't there? I don't
remember what
batch language it used.

>How about a thread on all the bootleg projects?

I think I've posted here before about one of the more interesting (and 
off-beat) bootleg projects I was involved with. There was a subculture of auto 
racers in the mill, of which I was one. Fred Gould was the head of the modules 
product line, and a drag racer. Ron Boudreau was in PDP-8 engineering and 
built and raced Formula Vees.

At that time (late '60, early '70s) Bosch had just introduced the first 
electronic fuel injection systems. The automotive press was talking about EFI 
as the technology of the future. We figured the auto industry would be needing 
control modules, and who better to build them than DEC?

I was given permission to devote 20% of my time (one day per week) to the EFI 
project. Ron secured a Bosch EFI module from a wrecked VW, and we disassembled 
and analyzed it. Fred assigned one of his engineers to work with us. We deemed 
the Bosch unit to be extremely primitive by DEC module standards, and 
determined we could reproduce the functionality of the module much more 
compactly and much, much cheaper.

At that time DEC had a relationship with GM by virtue of the PDP-14 project. 
Fred arranged a meeting with some folks at the Hydramatic Division (at that 
time sort of the "R&D" arm of GM) to talk about DECs possible future 
involvement in the production of control modules. Unfortunately the Hydamatic 
folks insisted that there were years of life in carburetors, and when GM 
eventually went to EFI they would probably tool up to produce their own 
control modules. We dropped the "project".

In retrospect, the GM people were dead on. Things happened just the way they 
predicted, and I recall some years ago reading that the largest producer of 
digital circuit modules in the world was GM.

That sure wouldn't be surprising;  IIRC, at least some versions of EDIT on
the PDP-8 used SR switches to control options (the one that I can remember is
for telling it whether to expand 2 or more spaces to a tab when reading the
input tape), so I figured this kind of behavior is where the term "switch"
comes from.

An ex-colleague of mine went on a 1022 training course with the company
which produced it (the name of which escapes me now) and was told that
it was so named because the number of employees at the company for which
they originally wrote it was 1022, a figure which was therefore much in
evidence in the primary database.  Hmm.

I'm pretty sure 1022 came out before TOPS-20.

To answer a question in another reply, Software House created
it, sold 1022 to Compuserve (which used it for its forum
software,) and finally got swallowed by CCA (or was it CA?)
for 1032 (the VMS variant) and other stuff.

It was interesting to get 1022 or FORTRAN messages occasionally
while using Compuserve.

Correct, at least according to Gene Sklaar who was Software House's marketing 
manager. According to Gene, that's what Charlie Houseman told him.

I remember an cubicle with a bag of "Flip Chip" doggie treats thumb-tacked
to the outside.  I believe Hartz still sells them, but not having a dog, I
don't keep up with such info.

That may have been after my time, but I heard about "Nothing sucks
like a VAX."

At CMU we discovered that the TU-10 tape drive used vacuum motors that had
the same form factor as some household vacuum cleaner.  Those motors were
a lot cheaper but didn't last as long, were louder, and sounded like a
vacuum cleaner.  We used them anyway.  Certainly didn't harm the TU-10's
performance (which sucked).

How that for subject drift?

Was this a TOPS-10 only thing or a general thing?  This usage is familiar,
in the MTS operating system (for IBM mainframes), "Snarked" is the state
that a job is put into when it encounters some impossible condition (at
least I *think* that's what it is).  Typically happens when you've been
playing around with trying to call undocumented low core entry points,
there are all kinds of goodies down there but they don't handle things very
graciously when called by an unpriv'ed program.  So of course the danger
was that the operators would catch on to who's been disasembling low core
(which was forbidden in spite of MTS's grand claims about security) when
they kept finding snarked jobs lying around, all with the same userID...

10 years?  It's been about 20 years for me, although I didn't throw in the
towel until the late 1980s.

I remember being interviewed by a reporter for a major Bay Area newspaper
(one that is supposedly tech-savvy) about hackers.  I discovered, to my
horror, that what she wanted to hear was stories about breaking into
systems.  She was completely disinterested in hearing about what, at the
time, we called "hacking" (today, we say "software engineering" or "tool
building" or some other euphemism).

She kept on trying to turn the conversation to breaking into systems.  
When I finally went out and told her that that was *not* the definition of
"hacking", she said something truly remarkable:

"We have decided what hacking means.  If you don't like it, that's just
too bad."

I asked her if it was OK with her if programmers started using the word
"prostitute" to mean "female journalist."


What eventually resulted was a full-page article in which she didn't use
any of the material from me.  However, a number of guys and gals I know
got suckered into her trap.  She embarassed them by trumpeting high school
escapades from 10 years earlier and making it appear as if this was
contemporary activity.  In several cases, she put words into their mouths
that they never said.

The result was my policy of refusing interviews unless I am paid and can
review what will be put in print associated with my name.  That gets rid
of US journalists, although some foreign journalists have agreed.

A general thing, sort of:

People read books they like to read.

People interested in computers are generally interested in logic and like to
read books about it. If you read a book you like to read, then you're
familiar with the words in it.

If people like one book by an author, they like to read other books by that
author.

Carroll wrote his wonderful books of logic problems and also the Snark, in
which he invented many imaginary things and named them. Confusing the bow
with the bowsprit was imaginary and was named "snarked."

People like to be thought clever, and someone is considered clever who
discovers or invents something new and gives it a clever name.

An old name is clever if familiar but appropriately applied to something
new. Something is appropriate if it is familiar. Confused computers were new
at the time, but confusion was quite familiar.

If you've followed all this, then it's obvious that computer people at the
time would like to name confused computers "snarked"

Therefore, I'd say that the use by TOPS-10 people was only one instance of
the more general proposition, similarly the usage for MTS.

ITS and the Lisp Machine certainly allowed one to explore all the things
that were possible, without "getting in the way" of the programmer.

But those operating systems did not run on the microcomputer CPUs
that MS-DOS ran on.   It's not that DOS (or CP/M) was the right thing
at the right time -- it was more like it was the *only* thing available.
CP/M and DOS were toy operating systems written for toy computers,
and when those computers grew up, the companies based on them continued
with them.  A few ideas were picked up from the more advanced systems
at Xerox PARC and retrofitted onto DOS in the form of Windows, but DOS
itself directly survived until at least a few years ago (1996).
By that time, Microsoft (and IBM) had a clean-sheet design for an 
operating system that continued with the GUI-based ideas but putting
them on top of something conceptually descended from VMS.

So it is largely ideas from Xerox PARC and from DEC that survive in
the flagship operating system of the flagship product ("Windows 2000")
of the dominent computer vendor.

I (and plenty of other people who used both) found ITS to be friendlier
and more powerful to hack around with than TOPS-20, but I think that
people who mosty worked on TOPS-20 might disagree.  (I am not trying to
really debate that here, just wanted to point out my opinion.)

The most often used kind of application today is the WYSIWYG display editor,
and the first one of those was TECO and EMACS, written in assembley and TECO, 
respectively, on ITS.  Today, there are fonts and things, and most such programs
are concerned with document issues that most versions of EMACS didn't deal with
at all.  But ITS had the first implementation of that concept.  And of course,
many programmers today still use EMACS (re-written by the original author).

 Bill> (Some of things that made tops/its/pdp10 asm-friendly did get copied into
 Bill> the lisp machines, I think.)

The Lisp Machine operating system, which was eventually named "Genera", did
indeed have some goodies copied from TOPS-20, notably the command processor.
(We're just talking ideas here, not any code.)  Genera's command processor was
actually light-years better than the TOPS-20 version, but TOPS-20 was the
inspiration for that particular feature.   The Lisp Machine was a quantum
revolution in operating sysetm design, much more powerful than any of the
other operating systems.  It had many revolutionary ideas in it, and it also
stole and sybthesized ideas from all the best operating systems of the time.
It was written by people who were primarily ITS, Multics, and TOPS-20 hackers.
It was not a multi-user system - it could have been extended to be one, but that
was not where the industry was headed.  Unfortunately, it was way ahead of its time,
especially in terms of the cost of deployment. A single-user personal computer
priced between $40,000 and $100,000 per seat was not going to make it.
There were many other questionable strategic business/marketing decisions.
Anyway, by the time that the hardware cost/performance ratio was there,
which was just a few years ago, the game was long over.

For those who still use keyboards and (non-curses-menu) text mode, the
COMND JSYS is still -- with certain extensions -- about the best you can
do.  Although the TOPS-20 EXEC had lots of aggravating limitations (many of
which were addressed by local hacks at CMU, MIT, Stanford, etc, and us at
Columbia: multiforking, kept editors, script programming (remember PCL?),
etc), it always had one big advantage over the UNIX shell, namely that it
didn't parse your commands blindly: it knew what field was supposed to be
-- a number, a filename, etc, and so (a) could give you specific help for
it, and (b) could validate it.  The shell, on the other hand, simply fills
in argv, assuming that every token on the command line is a filename, and
every metacharacter is to be used for filename matching.  You don't find
out until after you've entered the whole command what you did wrong, and
you can't find out what comes next if you don't know.

As you probably know, we (at Columbia) wrote a fairly complete COMND
package in C, called CCMD, which is still available:

  ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/ccmd/

A sample program built with it is a UNIX version of the TOPS-20 REV
program, found in the same directory.  Various people have started writing
UNIX shells based on CCMD but I'm not aware of any that were finished
enough to use.

Also C-Kermit, which doesn't actually use CCMD, has pretty much the same
user interface:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckermit.html

and has so much file management, etc, built into it that it *almost* can be
a shell.  The main thing lacking any more is job control (but then the Exec
didn't have that either :-).  Plus it adds programmability and intrinsic
directory-tree recursion when building or showing file lists (e.g. when you
type "?" in a filename or directory-name field).  Which, by the way, is not
an easy thing to accomplish in UNIX, which to this day does not have an
API (at least not a widely used one) for getting file lists -- something
that even CP/M 2.2 and DOS 1.0 had.

The different approaches of the EXEC and the UNIX shell tended to require
that the EXEC have all common operations built in, so it could
intelligently parse all fields of all commands.  Whereas the shell just
runs external programs, and you can't get command-line help for any of
them.  VMS sort of tries to find a compromise, but they didn't take it far
enough -- if you type a command incompletely, you are prompted for the next
field, and it doesn't matter whether the command is built in to DCL or is
external -- VMS almost succeeds in hiding the difference from you.  If they
had only taken it one step further and enabled single-character wakeup in
the command parser, with ?-help, completion, etc, it wouldn't have been
half bad.

Oh yeah, and one more thing -- after almost 20 years of using UNIX (after
more than 10 of using PDP-10 and 11 OS's), I still find the one thing I
miss most in UNIX is logical names.  At any large Unix installation like
ours, files are constantly being moved around, and once they move you can
never find them.  This is true for both users and programmers (e.g. where
is ioctl.h; where is [n]curses.h?).  Millions of programs are full of
stupid #ifdefs to find their header files, thousands of makefiles have
paths hardwired into them, and users constantly have to be editing their
PATHs to track slippery applications.  Fooey!

It's probably worth pointing to:

There's at least two such families of functions:

1.  http://www.unix.digital.com/faqs/publications/base_doc/DOCUMENTATION/V50_HTML/MAN/MAN3/0190____.HTM
says:

"

  readdir_r():  POSIX.1c
  rewinddir():  POSIX.1, XPG4, XPG4-UNIX
  seekdir():  POSIX.1, XPG4, XPG4-UNIX

2.  http://www.unix.digital.com/faqs/publications/base_doc/DOCUMENTATION/V50_HTML/MAN/MAN3/0462____.HTM
says:

"

I definitely grant that for all I know neither family's standard may be
widely implemented.

I thought there was a 3rd flavor on Alpha/Unix, but it's not popping up
this morning.

tcsh has a facility to learn the syntax of individual commands:

ftp://ftp.gw.com/pub/unix/tcsh/book/tcsh.html/Builtin_commands.html#complete

tcsh 6.09 ships with definitions for 164 commands.  Since this is a
project that could be done in a distributed fashion, it would be
interesting to get a lot more definitions for a lot more systems.

People are obviously publishing more command definitions over time, but
I don't know the details.

Stan Rabinowitz once implemented recognition and completion in DCL for
VMS.  It certainly wasn't shipped as a default; I don't know whether it

long keep pace with the advent of new commands, etc.

People make do with symbolic links as a poor substitute.


The PATH environment variable is in some sense one of the very few
logical names widely available on Unix (the other one that comes to mind
being /dev/tty).

Maintaining a working PATH on Unix seems like about as much of a problem
now as defining the set of the system's SUBSYS directories was on the
MR 20's in the past.  Once it was <LOADTEST>, <NEXT-RELEASE>,
<5-1-NEW-SUBSYS>, <NEW-SUBSYS>, <SUBSYS>, <UNSUPPORTED>, <EMACS>

It transmogrified to something like <LATEST-AND-GREATEST>, <FIELD-TEST>,
<AUTOPATCH-TEST>, <NEW-SUBSYS>, <SUBSYS>, <OLD-SUBSYS>,
<NEW-UNSUPPORTED>, <UNSUPPORTED>, <NEW-EMACS>, <EMACS>

What a headache.

Hey all.

I just lurk here. Mainly because my software involvement with the
10s was restricted to repeatedly crashing ADP's London based
development system (#18), during my brief and ill advised stint
as a programmer there. So 90% of what goes on here is waaay over
my head, but I do recognise a lot of the names. The majority of
my 5 years at ADPNS was as an operator, and later front line
customer support. Despite the unsocial working hours and a shift
pattern that left everyone perpetually tired, I still look back
on my days at ADP with much fondness. The company tended to suck
(of course), but that was more than made up for by the truly
wonderful people I was privileged to work with. Andy, Dave, Tony,
Sal and the rest, you know who you are :) It felt like family,
something I've haven't felt at any other place I've worked.

I don't know how many people here actually worked for ADP, and
how many of those actually saw the London based mainframe room,
but for the curious, I have a photo I took in the early '80s.
Unfortunately you can't see the CPUs (4 triple CPU systems
numbered #15 thru #18) as they are way down the back of the room.
However you can see the LA120 consoles, the tape decks, the
DECTapes and the usual computer room clutter. Of interest is a
set of 4 lights mounted on the ceiling, and numbered (big
surprise) 15-16-17-18. These were linked to their respective
systems in such a way, that in the event of a systems crash, an
air raid siren (really!) would go off and the appropriate light
would turn on. A few seconds before the siren went of, the
consoles would spit out their diagnostics, along with a bunch of
BELLs. Those of us tuned into the sounds of the room (much like a
ship's engineer) were already halfway down the room to reboot the
system before the BELLs and siren had a chance to go off, because
we knew the sound an LA120 makes when printing out the errors.

Although I would never go back to working a regular 12 hour shift
(11:00 - 23:00 days, 23:00-11:00 nights) or frequent 24 hour
stints and occasional 36 hour marathons (like the time the local
substation blew up) I still get the fuzzies when ADPNS is
mentioned.

If anyone is interested in a scan of my photo, I'd be only too
happy to mail them a copy for their web pages.

Hey :)

I liked the Mason's well enough, but it was just too easy to get
"summoned" from there when there was an emergency. I preferred
the Gruesome Horse (Horse and Groom) just down the road.

Were you around for the test of the Halon system just after it
was installed? The 10's didn't miss a beat, but the room was
trashed. Fanfold paper and ceiling tiles -everywhere-. I was one
of the people who offered to stay in the room when it went off,
and let me tell you it was an interesting ride! For those who
have never been in a room when halon goes *pop*, you experience a
negative-helium effect. My voice dropped at least two octaves,
enough to make Darth Vader sound like Mickey Mouse by comparison.

I got fired from ADPNS, ostensibly due to my refusal to wear
"business" clothes to work. Yeah right. After ADP, I went to work
for the Union Bank of Switzerland, and I had been there about 2
years when one week, a whole -host- of familiar faces arrived en
mass. After ADPNS closed down, a bunch of the systems staff there
were block hired by UBS. It was pretty weird. Oddly enough I was
fired by the same guy for the same reason (no suit (sic.))
shortly after he turned up, despite the fact that before he
arrived no-one had expressed any concern over my attire. Life
sure is strange.

If there are any ADPNS old timers out there who remember me, say
Hi why dontcha?

No.  The term luser was already current in the early 1980s:

This was from March 1980.  Luser simply meant user, with the
implication that all users were losers.  A tourist (often spelled
turist) was someone who had no connection with MIT.  We had a T show
up by our name, and we were chased away whenever there were more than
about 15 users on.  There were only 11 here, but only because this was
at about 4 am!

A turist (often spelled lusing turistic scum) who was logged in at the
wrong time was likely to have their account permanently deleted by the
Incredible Flushing Man.  And if you were flushed, it wasn't like you
could just call up another ISP and get a new account.

Jerry Pournelle, the SF author and Byte columnist, had his ITS account
permanently deleted in June 1984 for simply mentioning the net in his
Byte column.

Some golden age.

A friend of mine almost had his account denied because his username,
which was his nickname, sounded like it might be a company.  Ellen
Golden (sp?) was prescient, as DIGEX (Doug Humphrey) did indeed, a
decade later, turn his nickname into a multi-million dollar business.

Two months earlier (January 1980), the SF-LOVERS and HUMAN-NETS lists
were temporarily shut down, as they were bogging down the entire net.
The volume was about a dozen messages per day the size of this one to
about a hundred recipients.  The solution was to go to a digest form,
the first time this had ever been done.

Maybe it means we need to find a new name for the number between 41
and 43, since 42 has been redefined to mean the same thing as 2.

TIPs had no prompts.  If you typed something, nothing happened.
Unless you typed the @ character.  In which case you would probably
get the response "Bad".  Eventually you'd try "@O" in which case you'd
probably get the response "Num".  When you tried following it with a
number, you'll get connected to various sites.  On most of them you
wouldn't get very far.  But on host 134, and a few others, you could
issue various commands without logging in.  And if you tried to log
in, it would tell you that account is unknown, and ask you if you'd
like to apply for an account.

No.  Most tourists weren't telnetting in from elsewhere.  Most were on
TIPs.  MITRE-TIP and NBS-TIP were in Virginia.  ACCAT-TIP and AMES-TIP
were elsewhere.  They would support 300 bps dialup.  Some of them were
reputed to support 1200 bps, but since nobody I knew could afford a
1200 bps modem, it didn't matter.

Also, some tourists were local to MIT and dialed up directly.

I eventually bought a 1200 bps modem for about $200.  It worked for
a week then caught fire.  I then bought a better one for around $500.

Unfortunately there were two totally incompatible 1200 bps modems
standards, and it seemed like whatever one wanted to dial into used
only the other one.

No.  He just mentioned its existence, and the fact that his son Alex
used it.  (I finally got to meet Alex last year, and discussed this

It was for discussing the future of the net.  Unfortunately, the early
archives of this list apparently no longer exist.  (Somebody please
prove me wrong.)

Has anyone asked them if they mind it being used?  It's not exactly a
hot commercial property.  Anyhow, haven't there already been several
non-MIT ITS machines, e.g. one in Scandinavia somewhere?

Yes, the Stacken Computer Club ran ITS at one time, I believe.
Stacken is located in Stockholm, Sweden. Peter Lothberg
was/is pretty involved with them, which might explain a lot
about their PDP-10 actions. They also had what I believe was
the largest PDP-10 collection in the world. Not sure how much
remains now, though, since they had problems with floor space.

Minor nits:

1) TIPs used telnet...
2) 1200bps (vadic) modems appeared on the market in about 1980, right?
   (at about $1/bps IIRC) Before that there were some 1200/150 split speed
   modems (at stanford, maybe elsewhere?
3) I dunno about "most people used tips."  I seem to recall that a lot of
   people showed up as connected from other hosts.  Spent most of my time
   on ITS via  a tops10 (with local terminals at a whopping 2400bps!)
   running SUPDUP (had to write the SUPDUP program first, of course!) The
   SUPDUP client I wrote was SO much faster than the tops10 telnet client,
   perhaps largely because it used a larger bit allocation (which would
   probably be called a "window" these days.)

I was under the impression that telnet was a fairly late phenomenon;
"rsh" and "rlogin" were makeshift utilities on Berkeley Unix to be
used until telnet was implemented. Which would have dated telnet
somewhere in the early '80s, long after the first TIP. Of course,
telnet might have existed outside Unix for years.

Well, for many years, the official AT&T position was that 300 bps was
the max practical on an unconditioned voice grade line; the 103 and
113 modems could do this. Then RFL built a modem that seemed to work
just fine at 150 (inbound to the computer) and 1200 (outbound). These
were prized for graphics terminals (remember the Computek?). This
would be in the early '70s. Vadic then came out with their 1200/1200,
showing that it could be done; AT&T followed with the 212 modem, which
did the same thing, but was incompatible with the Vadic. I think the
212 eventually became the standard.

On TOPS-20, if you tried to log in when you had a detached session, it
would ask you if you wanted to attach back to the detached session instead
of logging in a new job.

One thing that is missed is that the detach was not a "save of state".  
No state is saved, because the only thing being destroyed on a disconnect
is the binding between job and controlling terminal.  The job is still
there, and you can attach back to it at any time.

If you are not logged in, attach requires the password.  If you're logged
in to the same user name as the detached job, then attach just does it
without requiring a password (and detaches the former job).

This latter feature (of being able to rotate between detached jobs) was
used more on TOPS-10 than TOPS-20, because TOPS-20 had multiple processes.  
Attaching/detaching on TOPS-20 was generally used only to recover from a
disconnect or possibly for a "suspend" type situation (you're walking away
from the terminal and want to keep your job safe from prying fingers...).

Right.  UNIX appears to do quite lot in user mode that the
TOPS10 philosophy wouldn't allow.  I suspect that this was one
of the reasons that Jim would have liked to design an OS
from scratch.  There pluses (security, data integrity 
and fast performance)and there were minuses (relinking 
and a bit of reassembly if new hardware was added to the system).
Since TW was a bit of a stick-in-the-mud w.r.t. new approaches,
I was trying to lay down all the preliminary ground work that
would have made it easy to add hardware with no relinking
as my role of architecting the packaging of the software.
I never got a chance to even start JMF on thinking about
a software design.  Instead, I changed my goal to enable
a complete rebuild and packaging of ALL the software with
one command.  Since it took almost no time to make a new
monitor, it wasn't painful, other than a reload, for the
customers to do.  I was also intent on shipping all the
procedures so that a customer some time in the future
would know how to do a build of everything once DEC
forgot it all.  That didn't happen, either.  I was really
barred from shipping anything useful to the customers.  We
wouldn't want to give them any advantage or help, after all.
That last line was dripping with sarcasm, by the way.

We had a very nice EDDT-like debugger in Alliant's Concentrix (SMP 4.2 BSD
code).  Of course, most of the OS group had major PDP-10 experience under
our belts.  Wish I had time to do one for Linux of Tru64.

One note about dealing with assembler code - when your program or
kernel blows up with a bogus memory reference, just having the PC (which
often gives you the line of code) still leaves you with the hassle
of figuring out exactly where in the line of code things died.

Being able to read disassembled code is still a useful skill.

I don't know that I'd go so far as saying that it shuffles the monitor
code, but I did have lots of fun battling the MACRO32 compiler and the
hardware on a number of my device drivers. The most annoying bits were:

  - The hardware would re-order and gather writes. Of course, this is
    what the barrier instructions are there to control.
  - The MACRO32 compiler would re-order reads. Fortunately, it didn't
    re-order them across a barrier, so it was still possible to control
    this using barriers.
  - Occasionally, the MACRO32 compiler would optimize out a CSR access.
    The example that springs to mind is a TSTL that I used to clear a
    CSR flag. Since it wasn't followed by a conditional branch, the
    compiler decided the TSTL wasn't needed and tossed it.

Of course, directly mapping CSRs and talking to them was not the official
way to do things under VMS (it still isn't, although there are now some
decent alternatives to the CRAM stuff for systems that _can_ talk directly
to the CSRs). My device driver style tends to be of the "bonk VMS over
the head and steal its wallet variety"; I was porting a VAX TURBOchannel
driver to the Alpha and didn't want to rewrite it, so I just mapped the
CSRs on the Alpha as I had on the VAX (did I mention that I had a couple
of VAX TURBOchannel drivers running before DEC had TURBOchannel support
ready? I kind of _had_ to bonk VMS over the head and steal its wallet).

;-> You've been reading the _Tops-20 Monitor Calls Reference Manual_, haven't
you?  That's a *very* good description of the way file generations work on
Tops-20.

It is left to the individual user; the standard system default is to keep only
1 generation of each file, though I suppose someone with sources could change
that number.  There are actually two such settings:  The directory may have a
particular default assigned to it, and a group of files can have a different
setting than the directory default.

Another nice feature of the Tops-20 filesystem is that deleting a file is
really a two-step process:  The DELETE command in the EXEC (a call of the DELF%
JSYS) only marks a file as deleted in the FDB; the space is not reclaimed until
someone executes a call of the DELDF% JSYS (via an explicit EXPUNGE command in
the EXEC or an implicit expunge by logging out).  Of course, user programs can
use those JSYi as well--MMailr, the MTA portion of the MM mail system, handles
its queue directory by explicit calls of DELF% and DELDF%, since it normally
runs as a daemon and never logs out.

The point of that little side-trip is that if the user creates one or more
new generations of a file, and then realizes that an old one should be kept,
a simple UNDELETE will recover one or all deleted generations--and then a new
generation retention can be set for them.  Cuts way down on the number of
requests for file restoration from backups.

There's a reference to a TREPLACE command in Alice's PDP-10:

"
After the ordeal, Ann took us back downstairs and left us with the CLU
hackers.  She said "Kid, I'm gonna leave you with the CLU hackers.  I
want your jsys manual and your ROLM DTI".  I said "Ann, I can
understand your wanting my jsys manual so I won't remind the CLU
hackers of grody things like operating systems, but what do you want
my DTI for?" and she said "Kid, we don't want any VTS errors".  I said
"Ann, did you think I was going to try to crash the system for
littering?"  Ann said that she was making sure, and friends, Ann was,
'cause she cleared all my left-hand privs bits so I couldn't logout.
And she disabled the TREPLACE command so I couldn't crock in an
XCT [0] instruction, cause an illegal instruction interrupt to MEXEC,
and sneak into MDDT.  Yeah, Ann was making sure, and it was about four
or five hours later that Chiappa (remember Chiappa?  This song's never
even mentioned Chiappa) Chiappa came by and with a few gratuitous
insults to the CLU hackers bailed us out of there, and we went out and
had another Chinese dinner that couldn't be beat, and didn't get up
until the next morning when we all had to go to LCS Computational
Resources staff meeting.
"

Recollection:

TREPLACE was the way to replace the top-level exec - it's not as if
there was a per-user exec preference, at least not initially.

I don't know about *that* TREPLACE, but I think the one I recall only
worked for wheels - it would select fork 0 (the user's top-level EXEC
itself), and use DEPOSIT to patch in code to run the preferred exec.

I might have used it before the multi-forking EXEC (and later PCL) was
party-approved in MR.

One guy in the GALAXY group started using a wildly different program
as his EXEC.  I'm tempted to say it was MACLISP.  I think several other
programs like ITS EMACS would have been plausible top-level EXECs on
TOPS-20.

That's Explorer crashing and restarting. They couldn't figure out how to
stop it from crashing, so they added hooks so that most of the time when
it crashes it restarts REALLY FAST.

Sure? It takes less than a second on a P200 with NT 4.0 SP6a, they've got the

Private discussion with Microsoft employees. Nothing I can point you at online.

Splitting up Microsoft would have almost no effect on them, those blokes don't
talk to each other much anyway.

And this attitude is why DEC is no more.  We began to nail
our coffin closed when we stopped asking, I mean listening,
the users what they needed.  This is the attitude that
was not tolerated while Jim and Tony were in the monitor
group.  After they left, things went downhill very rapidly
and I couldn't stop the flow.

These decisions were a constant juggling act whenever a
change to TOPS10 software was made.  From our point of
view, TOPS20 was less flexible than TOPS10.  From the
point of view of the TOPS20 types, we were very sloppy
and not "disciplined" at all.

No, issues arose where someone asked what an instruction did on a KL, or
disagreed with how it should work, or claimed there was a microcode bug.

If I recall correctly, at least once DDT, the manual and the KL all gave
different results.

Ditto.  You put a write ring in so you can write to it.  When you finish
writing to it you pull the ring out.  (We'd got this to the point of
reflex -- when you dismounted a reel you were expected to immediately
remove the write ring and toss it into the big box of discarded write
rings.  Tapes got write rings either because they already ad 'em out
of the box (in which case they were emty anyway) or when a positive 
decision to scratch a tape was made.

It meant that if you werent on the ball it was likely that you'd try
to mount a tape for writing without the write-ring in, but you had 
to be having a really bad day to get it wrong the other way.

The dreaded TU58 (and presumably other tapes in the same or similar form
factors) had a slider to write enable or protect the media.  If you
wanted to really protect it you could remove the slider completely.  You
can do the same with 3.5" disks, but it tends to require weapons to do...

That's happening.  Don't forget the compiler group - they're coming up
with C "#pragmas" to help lay out data structures on cache line boundaries
and other things to help make each memory reference be all that it can be.

  I think all of these problems

At Alliant I got the HIPPI designers to agree to accept virtual addresses
so the OS wouldn't have to come up with a long list physical addresses
to send megabyte messages from.

Most of the OS group had PDP-10 experience, so we alway managed to get
some LEDs added to the various boards.  We also had enough hardware
experience so we knew what was feasible.

I work on NFS these days.  For the most part that's sufficienty removed
from the hardware so I don't influence new systems at Compaq much.  Other
people still do.

Keep in mind that in these days of 1 GHz CPUs, light travels one foot
per cycle, and electricity only travels about 70% that fast.  If you're
trying to design a system too big for one board, requesting what one
"wants" is fantasy.

Damn, I miss the KA-10's lights.  :-)

Back when I was doing this during my college years, the biggest single thing I

did was read in cards :-)  Most of the time I was saved from having to burst
printouts as there were I/O clerks for that.  Swapping disk packs was
another biggy.  In addition to working part time at college I had a summer
job a couple summers at a large well known firm.  Like the walls of tape
drives which preceded it, they had walls of IBM 2314's.  I was quickly
taught how to change packs.  You turned off the power, waited about a
second or so, ripped the drawer open and then put the palms of both
hands down on the top of the still rapidly spinning pack to brake it even
faster than the loudly clicking drive brake could (but not so fast as to
burn your hands although I came close a couple of times ;-)  This seemed
to be SOP at this commercial site.  The IBM CE's were aware of it.
If I had done this at the college computer center they'd have thrown me
off the roof of the computer center ;-) (and I would have helped them,
but when in Rome...)  I think the programmers at this site were having
trouble thinking beyond tapes as they called for disk changes on the
new systems then being installed about as fast as tape changes on
the older systems.

The biggest thing I found I could do was help with the "scheduling".
Usually a batch system will stop and wait for a resource, thus idling
the "expensive" machine and slowing the throughput.  Instead of
just reading in the cards as they came I would "batch" jobs which
had similar requirements for tapes or disks.  If a job required
several tapes I would mount them before reading in the job, then
read in the job and up its priority so it would be the next one run.
Thus the machine didn't have to wait for me to mount tapes or
disks.

that we always had new hardware designers for the follow-ons.
And it was guaranteed that the same mistakes would
be reinvented because the ones who had learned from a
previous design had been promoted to management.

TW's writeup, "Tony in RH20 Land -or- I Should Have
Listened When Mother Told Me There Was A Great Future 
In Encyclopedia Sales" describes quite a number 
of the classic design flaws of the hardware types, 
who have no inkling that software has to manipulate
their creations.

  Microsoft was a very large user of the hardware in their early days.
The Gates/Allen/Davidoff Microsoft BASIC interpreter, the BASIC compiler
(BASCOM) and the Woods Microsoft Fortran compiler were all written and
maintained on that hardware. There was an in-house assembler which did
not use standard Intel 8080 mnemonics, and which had rather extensive
macro capabilities (the BASIC interpreter and compiler shared much of
the same source, with the selection of a macro library controlling which
of the two got produced).

  At a source-license customer for the interpreter, I had the task of
defining a new macro library for Digital Research's macro assembler to
allow the oddball source to be compiled natively under CP/M prior to the
customer integrating their unique additions to the interpreter.

  These (and the earlier TU78's and TU77's) were all wonderful drives if
properly maintained (a big *if* given DEC Field Service's lack of train-
ing on these). I had a row of 8 TU77/78 drives (6 78's and 2 77's) at the
peak when I was at SPC. I self-maintained all of them.

  BTW, a TU79 is the same guts as a TU78 (likewise for TA79/TA78) except
that all the FCO's are factory-applied and the door style is different.
This is because a certain large customer (who shall be unnamed, but who
has a 3-letter name and likes to number tape drives with unit numbers
like "280" 8-) was interested. Hence the door style change, which was
made (among other reasons) to accomodate that vendor's 3-digit hexadec-
imal unit number stickers.

  Yup. Part of the problem was that FS was too cheap to actually stock the
ECO'd modules, so FS techs got sent out with instructions like "reverse
all the caps on the GCR boards" and wound up screwing up the drives.

Some card readers were particularly good at "reading" rubber (gum :-) bands.
The UNIVAC 1004 would suck them quite a way into the mechanism before
giving up............

I don't recall the numbers as it was the late 60's early 70's but card
readers
on PDP-10's and PDP-11's were common back then as cards were the
most popular and portable form of program and data storage back then.

Different manufacturers had different ideas about what was appropriate
protection against power fluctuations.  At my PPOE at one time we had 
an S/360-65, S/370-148, and a DEC KL-10, and (partly at my urging) had
bought a Dranitz power line monitor.  Based on matching the printout
of power-line incidents from the Dranitz to system failures, we found
that the -148 (which had an MG set) could survive nearly a full second
of interruption to the power; the -65 (no MG) would hold up for about
16 cycles, and the KL-10 never survived more than about 5 cycles
of outage.  (The campus power was -- to put it charitably -- not
particularly reliable or clean.)

On the second -10 I used (BOCES/NCODE KA109 in Westbury, LI, NY), seeing
a job in [1,4], etc. generally meant that yet another high school
student had managed to swipe ACCT.SYS.  Looking at an octal dump of
PPN's, privs and passwords seemed to make some people exquisitely aware
of what UFDs had associated accounts.

Hanley M Strapman (HMS) was certainly not fictitious, after all, he wrote all the
programming examples, didn't he?   :-)

In any case, whenever you called and asked for him, it was almost certain that he
"was there, but just stepped out....may I take a message?"

This line worked very well when he was at the U of Arizona, where he wrote a rather large
number of SPRs on the -10 they had there (as well and the ANF network they were running,
with an ANF connection to the CDC systems, as well.)

Of course we already knew.  Who the hell did you think kept

As an example, consider the Computer Museum's effort to
get some cash by chopping up a working computer, encasing
the chopped liver in plastic and selling it to tourists.

When the IBM PC was announced, the Director of the Division of Computer
Research and Technology (DCRT) at the National Institutes of Health
personally saw to it that about 20 (exact number missing from memory) were
ordered and spread around the division just to see what they might be
useful for. Why? Well, we were, and still are, a moderately large
administrative IBM mainframe shop, so the prevailing opinion was that if
IBM made it, it had to be worth something. Even though us techie types kept
saying to ourselves "why in the world did they do it THAT way", before long
IBM PCs were sitting on every desk.

We also provided timesharing to the general scientific community with a
3-processor DECsystem-10. When the 36-bit line was tossed down the tube, it
sure wasn't a VAX system that replaced it: the Un*x guys had been waiting
for their chance, and this was it. Granted, the "replacement" was a
top-of-the-line Convex system (with DECnet, no less), but the camel's head
was in the tent even though several of the most popular TOPS-10
applications were never ported nor were they even replaced with
semi-equivalents. Cold turkey, it was - after all, everyone just knew that
Un*x was going to completely take over the world in a year or two......(the
Convex was swapped for an SGI multiprocessor system a few years ago). The
IBM is still there, and there are still several dozen VMS systems chugging
away in niches here and there, too.

On a whim, I bet Todd Matson 4 cokes, that he wouldn't roll his
DECtape down the corridor of MR1.  He said sure, made sure he rolled
it the "right" way, and tossed it.

Well, it flipped over in flight, and was going down the hall,
unrolling all the way.  The sight of Todd, running with one foot on
each side of the tape, while trying to bend over and pick it up was
worth the 4 cokes.

He finally caught up with it just after all the tape was off the
spool.

No problem here.  We just went down the hall another 50 feet, dragging
the tape on the floor, into the machine room, and right over to the
DECtape drive on 1026.  Get the tape started, hit the wind button, and
30 seconds later, the tape is back, and worked just fine.

You guys would do anything for a coke or chocolate.  The previous

And a fork lift could have run over it and you still would have
been able to read the bits.  That wasn't true with oiled paper
tape.  I know from experience on 12-1.

Yeah?  Well Ron (Bugs) McLean once mentioned to me that if you held the end of
the tape and rolled the spool on the floor it wouldn't go very far.
I thought for a second, took the tape he had just written, and rolled the
spool off my finger and had it bounce along the floor.  Went just fine!

Did the same thing.  I stood in the doorway to guide the tape around
the corner so it wouldn't scrape on the door frame.  Not that a little
scraping would have done much except leave brown dust on the door....

Didn't cost me a single Coke!

Oh - I never tried, but he's probably right about holding the tape and
rolling.  The spool will take up the slack on the tape and start
slipping on the floor and the friction will stop it soon.

One of the "characters" in Firesign Theatre's "I think we're all Bozos
on this Bus" is "Doctor Memory":

  DOCTOR MEMORY:

  The big computer that runs everything in the FUTURE FAIR, described
  in the FT's BOZO play. The Doctor was also mentioned in a poem on
  the "Dear Friends" album. He is based on an old SAILON LISP program
  written for the PDP-10 running the TOPS-10 operating system. AhClem
  repeatedly calls Dr. Memory "Mac" - which far predates the current
  Apple computer line; but the MIT AI lab, where the Doctor program
  originated, grew out of Project Mac (for Machine Aided Cognition
  and/or Multiple Access Computer)

	<URL: http://www.benway.com/firesign/lexicon/D.html >

The Yellow Rubber Line was the way you got around the Future Fair.

This was a big problem at the MIT AI Lab in the mid-1970s.  A certain
programmer there, well-known today, used to protect his ownership of
software by patching the installed binaries but not updating the sources.
He'd pencil in the patch in a hardcopy listing, but those listings weren't
always reprinted when the source was changed; so you were obliged to read
every page of code exhaustively.

Voila!  Software that nobody else dared edit.

There is patching and then there is the real code fix.  The

Heh, heh.  Up here CVS is where I get my drugs.  Tim's got
a lot to learn (along with the rest of us unwashed masses)
about development.  Coding and debugging are really a small
part of producing a product.  He may be one of those people
who can only do the coding/debugging part--I worked with
a few who tended to go berserk if they had to do the rest
of the crap work :-).

I figure that, once he gets his sources available, he's going
to learn about pests, a freer version of SPRs, and meet
people at the coding level.  The last is fun; I just hope
the former doesn't discourage him.

   This is mildly reminicient of the time one of the programmers at
ADP needed to force an error on a DECtape (I forget the reason why).
He was finally forced to use a three-hole punch to blow away enough
of the magnetic real-estate to cause an error.  The rest of us were
saddened because none of us were fast enough to patch his program to
read "3-HOLE PUNCH DETECTED ON DTA0:" when it hit the bad spot on
the tape....

Huge rambling follows, please read fully as to avoid any hostility :)

***

All the below is said with a sarcastic grin and a good sense of humor.
I don't mean to offend anyone, I'm just playing devil's advocate.

I found the TOPS-20 operating system to be much better organized than
TOPS-10. A by-product of re-writing an operating system from scratch
for a system that had been around a little while. Of course, the people
involved probably INTENDED this to happen. I liked it a lot, but for
some reason, I couldn't accept it in the face of TOPS-10. Why not
continue refining and redefining tops-10? All of TOPS-20 could have
been done inside the framework of TOPS-10.
 
> Here are some more:

Yes, it did. The only problem was you had to use a PTY, log it in, and
then deal with the I/O associated with it. If you used a sharable high-seg,
the forked job would get a complete SHARED copy of the memory of the 
parent. The low-seg would be used to keep private stuff. A careful
programmer could do wonders... I'll admit, the overhead in doing
so was higher than in TOPS-20, but hey... bear with me :)

> TOPS-20 had a shell, TOPS-10 had the command processor built into the

I found this to be an advantage in half the cases. The other half, of
course, by default, having a shell improved things, but I can still
think of quite a few problems I've had where the command shell being
part of the monitor would have helped.

The biggest advantage of an in-kernel (monitor) command parser was
the ^C, CCONT sequence. Run something, hit ^C and type CCONTI (CCONTINUE)
or just plain CC and be able to do other things while the job was
running (like DETach). UNIX has it with ^Z (stop), but I liked
to be able to E and D the memory of a program I was running.

> TOPS-20 had long file names, TOPS-10 had 6.3 (worse than DOS!).

Hey, if you can't remember that "MMWCB.DAT" didn't equate to
"My Mother Wears Combat Boots.dat" (typical Windows 95 file name),
I can't help you there. :) 

Besides, with some engineering, TOPS-10 UFD's could easily cover
much longer filenames and be compatible with previous versions.

> TOPS-20 had user names, TOPS-20 had a pair of octal numbers

Again, there was a mapping to a username, but it wasn't obvious. 
I kinda liked it. One 36-bit word was better than 2 or 3 words for
a username in ASCII (or SIXBIT).

> TOPS-20 had file/memory mapping, TOPS-10 did not.

You're right, and it was one of the biggest leaps I had made when working
with VAX-11/780's. You could map an entire database file into memory and
then work on it like memory. Too bad it was so slow that I could have
made my own cache and buffering structure and used my own routines and
greatly improved performance. But, my boss and I had made the design
decision to go ahead with mapping... oh well... another problem was
the customer was reluctant to add more physical memory, since it was
costly. 

> TOPS-20 had the debugger always available, in TOPS-10 you had to link
>  the program with the debugger.

Not a big deal for me, UNIX these days still requires you to compile with
an extra switch to keep symbol information. Without it, it's still possible
to debug the program, remember DDT? I used it quite a lot to hack hack hack.
Not to mention E and D (examine and deposit) and "start <address>".

Hmm... in looking over the previous paragraph I realize that I never actually
had to link the debugger into the program to be debugged. Is the above true
about having to link in the debugger? I seem to remember that it was not 
required.

> TOPS-20 had user mode extended addressing, I don't think that TOPS-10
>  ever did.

I kinda think the KL10 could do this. I seem to remember playing around with
this on KS10's. I could access quite a bit more memory than would be normal 

I used it to generate large matrixes representing something -
DAMN, but I don't remember. I had to hand-code some things, since
the MACRO-10 compiler didn't deal with the extensions available on the
KS10. If I just dumped OCTAL code into memory and ran it, I could
do much more in terms of large-scale memory, but I don't remember how
I did it... In this time, I had access to the microcode for the KS10
and that may have had something to do with it, but honestly I don't
remember.

> TOPS-20 had the COMND% JSYS, TOPS-10 had (shudder) SCAN/WILD.
> TOPS-20 had command and filename completion, TOPS-10 did not.

Sorry, but if I can type the first few chars of a command, why hit
<ESC> to complete it, for verbosity? Or for the beep that said you
hadn't typed enough characters yet?

As for filename completion, I've been bitten too many times by that
sort of thing...

Yeah, SCAN/WILD could have used some help, but with TOPS-20 experience,
could you go back and implement it under TOPS-10?

> The most ruinous limitation of TOPS-10 was the lack of forks, which made
> TOPS-10 quite obsolete by the mid-1970s.

Again, you just had to be creative. Dump your entire range of volatile
memory to a file (context switch), launch another job (PTY) and let it get 
it from there. Or use shareable highsegs - my favorite. Multi-threaded
(jobs) stuff is quite easy when they each have access to the same memory.
Matter of fact, I can think of a few different ways to do POSIX threads with
TOPS-10, albeit emulated.

> There were a few things that TOPS-10 did better (e.g. SMP) but that wasn't

Not priveleged enough to ever experience it, although I had hacked into a
PDP-10 with two CPU's in the late 70's. Pretty strong machine, I don't
remember what class (KA,KI,KL). I believe KL.

From what I saw as an outside customer (way outside), DEC was whole-hog
into the 32-bit VAX while the K line was (to me) the way to go. Imagine
a 72-bit KX10 based on Alpha technology? I just got a warm feeling in
my gut :) I know a few hardware designers that could produce this sort
of thing in a Xilinx chip. Should I figure out what it would take to
produce a PDP-10 on a chip based on Timothy Stark's code?

***

All the above is said with a sarcastic grin and a good sense of humor.
I don't mean to offend anyone, I'm just playing devil's advocate.

***

The main dichotomy in the above results from people comparing static versions
of TOPS-10 with TOPS-20. Given the larger systems that TOPS-20 ran on,
could TOPS-10 have been expanded to include the functionality of TOPS-20
without losing the "feel"?

by the way, what IS the statute of limitations on hacking?

(Remembering a college-kid's dream)

Possessing a PDP10 was a lovely, hopeful, impractical dream!!!  It
might (probably will) effectively happen (the emulator),
and it is wonderful that people (e.g. Timothy) have time to
spend to create the mechanism that will make a dream
come true (however old, and probably stale that
dream is :-).)  I know that some of you'all have really
possessed your own PDP10, or effectively so -- but if that
kiddie-hacker dream was realized, the logistics of owning
and running one back then would have been overwhelming for
an individual with at-the-time very modest income.

One very interesting observation about my playing with
the 11 emulators is that I am VERY spoiled with the
performance of current machines. 

Anecdote, but alot of you probably have even more outrageous
examples:

A few (about 9-10) years ago, I participated in upgrading a
software system that was based upon an 11/73 or 83 that was
written about 10years or so earlier yet???  (Originally it was an
11/23???...  It has been a very long time.)  Anyway, a compiler
that written in C for a PDP-11, deployed in approx 1980-1982,
took about 15mins to complete a certain compile...  When 
upgraded, the system ran on a UNIX clone, using almost
the exact source code that ran on the RSX11M DECUS-C
environment, the 'compile' took about 10secs or so.  That demo
was performed using a Pentium 100MHz or maybe even a 486/33...
The performance difference was so astonishing that it was
initially unbelievable (even to me, the original author),
and one *important* step in the process to sell the upgrade
was to convince that the improvement wasn't 'cooked.'  Of course,
the convincing was relatively easy, but the issue of faking
the demo did have to be dealt with, even in the very trusting
atmosphere with that customer.

This is semi-off topic, but even though I want to play with
Timothys' WONDERFUL software (I have faith), I hope that my
wish to play with it isn't overwhelmed by the speed difference...
This is very very sincere!!!  Since it appears that it performs
about as well as some of the real PDP10's, it will still both be
useful and fun (I hope :-)).  Maybe, if enough developer-types
end up helping Timothy (ONLY if he wants, of course) to tune up
various things, or shortcut the emulation for certain types
of operations, his new "PDP10" could be a couple of times
faster than a real KL?.

Issues like this are certainly a distraction at this time, so
this isn't meant as anything but "conceptual."  Alot of the people
that I am talking to probably know alot more about this stuff
than I'll ever have time to know -- so don't be insulted!!! With
a PDP-11 emulator it seems like carefully optimizing a  (Sorry if
the syntax is a little off.)

"1: movb (r1)+, (r2)+; jne 1b"

or

"2: mov (r1)+, (r2)+; dec r3; jne 2b"

type operation would likely be profitable?  (Lots of stuff like
checking for addressing traps might have to be planned for before
the move starts, but hardware device interrupts might be able
to be ignored during the transfer?)  Looking at the emulator
from gatekeeper it seems that it might get rid of alot of
overhead for things like the common block transfer?  It seems
like dealing with self modifying code could make this a little
tricker -- oh yeah -- PDP10 software did alot of those self
modifying tricks!!!  Even thinking about it makes me want to
play with a 10 for a while...

Even though there are now few material things that many of us
want or need, I suspect that a working PDP10 emulator would 
make many older hackers happy :-).

   Remember, too, that Barb's astute observation that there are two
distinct kinds of -10-heads - the hardware head and the software
head.  Those two camps will likely desire (or dream about) different
implementations.

   The old-line hardware type is going to want his -10 done in
silicon (save the absolute purist who might insist on Germanium),
and will demand blinking lights and places to stick a 'scope probe
into.

   The programming set, on the other hand, won't care what the
implementation looks like, nor even how it's done - if it works
by the book, only that it run and "feel" like a -10 should.  Remember
that the vast majority of -10 programmers may never have seen the
machine they were working on (it being in the large cold room), so
they have no preconceived notions of what the box should look like.

   Everybody knows what side of the fence I'm on, but occasionally
I climb it to see what's on the other side.

Aw, shucks, Barb.

I was late to the game for a lame release, and probably didn't contribute as
much as a real hacker would have liked to.

I loved the PDP-10 and TOPS-10 to an extent that I now feel almost qualified
to label "unhealthy."  For the life of me, I never did find any activity as
fun as writing -10 code (Macro-10, please, with the damn tabs).

But, it's been dead for years, and maybe it's time to move on.

The more astute among you would ask what I'm doing cruising this news group
if I've moved on, but then again, complete freedom from hypocrisy was never
something I laid claim to.

NCODE put checks for JP.MAC in DDT.EXE and DDT.REL.  However, while
DDT.EXE was protected execute-only, they couldn't do that with DDT.REL,
so it was world-readable.


You know, ALGOL-10 supports binary file I/O.

And there aren't many GETTABs to wade through in DDT.REL...

BAH's comments about the group picture that was taken outside MR1-1
that was supposed to show and celebrate first KL ship reminded me of a
story that I have not thought of in many years.

The KL launch somewhat preceded my tenure at DEC, but I was told this
story, which I was never sure whether to believe or not.

According to the story I was told, the KL launch was celebrated
outside MR-1 in a ceremony that included Ken Olsen and a cannon (or
cannons) that fired a big-bang salute to the KL.  I was also told that
some wag in the PDP-10 group had a rubber chicken ready, and when the
cannon(s) sent off, he threw is so it landed on the platform with
K.O., et al.

Was any of this story true?  K.O. at the KL launch?  Cannons?  Rubber
chicken?

That reminds me: the emergency power off for the PDP-10 KL processor was
a slightly recessed rectangular rocker switch.  Someone can correct me,
but it was rumored to conceal a horizontal pin which would drop and
prevent the switch from being turned on again without field service
first having reset the pin.  The rumor was that this was done by holding
the switch or its panel upside-down and shaking...

Probably because the field servant didn't want to get called in the
middle of the night just to move some stupid spring out of the way with
a small screwdriver...

Hmmm, until now I thought the coarse and fine speed controls on the KA
margin panel ran the basic machine states.  Now I see that it was solely
the repeat rate for the console switches.

I wonder why the find speed control was taped down on KA 101?  It's not
as if people were sitting around leaning on the repeat key under normal
circumstances.

Yes, I'm sure some of the lines definitely exceeded the RS232 spec. A
few lines (such as those linking to the DEC-10 3/4 mile away did use
modems but the cost to was cosnsidered too high to do this across the
board. If memory serves it was quite common for lines to snake across
campus twisted around hot water pipes and the like in various
educational institutiions - making lightning strikes interesting...

The resistor mod (I think between TX/RX and GND but am not sure) was
recommended by DEC field service.

We had a card reader/punch with a serial interface connected to one of
the lines on the CFE.  The first time we hooked it up, it brought the 1091
to its knees.  The fix was to use a cable that had 1, 2, 3 and 7 only.

They were not supported with the 1091 first came out (version 7.00).
By 7.02, they were supported.  The thing that gave the system a real
workout was a smooth-scrolling VT100 running at 9600 baud.

Actually there are cars in which the positive battery terminal is near
enough to grounded chassis parts that jewelry is a risk.

In the DEC PDP-10 (KL10-R) processor I just moved, there are clear plastic
covers over the DC power supplies and distribution panels, with warnings
to remove jewelry before working on it.  The first stage of the supply
was rated for 12V at 490A, and could provide much more current if
shorted.  Shorting that would be absolutely spectacular.  I saw at
least one point in the power distribution where a 3/8 inch piece of
metal (such as a ring) could cause a short.

In fact, the technical term for such a shorting bar was a "crowbar",
because in the high-powered radio transmitters where such emergency
power-off devices were first used, the shorting bar *was* the size
of a crowbar... or bigger!!

The term survives even to this day in power supplies to describe an
SCR or triac used for overvoltage protection (by shorting the output).

It's real interesting because it means that the job's

the monitor.

Heh, I forgot all about funny space.  Haven't heard that term in

I have to agree. I've seen many large applications that are horrible
in terms of what they do. 

People reading this newsgroup are the sort that actually try to make
their software perform well. I was initiated into that while running
programs on a KA10. I was blasted by the sysadmins because I was eating
up CPU. So, I had to change my way of thinking, and suddenly everything
fell into place. Cutting a routine from 10 instructions to 5 made a 
difference not only in memory, but time. Doing that over the entire
program would result in huge savings in time to load from disk,
execution time, and memory.

This doesn't seem to happen to the generic Computer Science graduate.
Most programmers I've seen have had schedules stuffed in their face
and they are stuck with producing something within a short amount of
time. Result: software that was never optimized.

Look at Microsoft... their attitude is permeating the rest of the
world. Upgrade your hardware, and it will perform just FINE!

For instance, Tim could have gotten 2 MIPS with his un-optimized code
on a 2GHz Pentium III. Any large company's answer to performance problems
is usually "more/faster hardware".

{ take all the above at face value - don't flame me for my views, I don't
mean to offend anyone. }

I might care.  I'm using JMF's keyboard now and it really sucks.
75% of the time, when I use the left hand shift key, it doesn't
take.  And, somehow, Jim caused the right hand shift key to
commit a slope.  It might have been an aspect of his two-fingered
typing style.

Now, if you only could produce a source of User-Device-From-Hell
that I can manage to use, I'd be one happy woman.  I actually
accidentially "fixed" my substitute track ball.  I took out the
ring that holds the ball in place, and glory be!  I can now
thumb the ball.

I'd still like the feel, slant, and character position of the
VT06.  The 52 was OK; 100s sucked.

Yes indeed.  Everybody's taste in keyboards differs, but I think most readers
of this newsgroup have definite ideas about where the Ctrl, Esc (Altmode),
Backslash, Del and other roving keys should be.  After all, some of us still 
use EMACS and even TECO, and touch-type, thus need these keys in reach without
leaving the home position.

The first thing many of us do when getting a new PC or PC OS is to figure 
out how to map Caps Lock to Ctrl and Grave to Esc (in DOS, Windows 3.x,
Windows 9x, Windows NT, Linux, FreeBSD, SCO, Plan 9, Solaris...), but it
would be so much nicer to have a normal, usable keyboard in the first place.

As a writer of portable software, I have a PC with pluggable hard disks
that allows me to boot any number of OS's (currently about 20), and figuring
out the mapping for all of them is just too much trouble.

So I bought a "Happy Hacking" keyboard, which at least has Ctrl and Esc
in the right place, but unfortunately the entire upper-right group is
hopelessly mal-arranged -- Delete, Backslash, Grave, Tilde.  Also, the feel
is not that great: mooshy, no feedback.  (To me, the best feeling keyboard 
ever is the big heavy IBM 101, which they don't make any more).

So yes, I'd be interested to hear about the Avant, especially about the
"manual programming", since computer-driven configuration can only be done
from Windows.  If a consistent configuration can be kept when booting amongst
Windows, Linux, SCO, etc, and it has the IBM 101 heft and feel, it could be
just the thing.

: Now if someone would make VT52 or VT100 style keyboards for PCs, *that*
: would be something!
: 
I went through VT05, VT50, VT52, VT100, VT220, and VT320 on my desk before
finally switching to PCs.  (Not to mention Hazeltine 1200, Fox 1100,
Concept 100, etc).  I remember the VT100 as if it were some kind of
exercise machine you would find in a gym :-)  PCs are actually quite nice
if you can map the keyboard -- and they let you have 10 or 20 VTxxx's on
your screen at once :-)

Speaking of keyboards...  In the neverending quest for the perfect keyboard,
wouldn't it be nice if the keytops actually said what the key will do or
send?  Unfortunately, nobody types any more except us old-timers (*), so this
will never happen but... Imagine a keyboard in which each keytop was some
kind of low-power display -- LCD or whatever -- that could be set by the
host software.  Kind of like what Macintosh "keycaps" does, but on the
keys themselves.

(*) As personal computers gradually transmogrify into entertainment centers
    -- glorified telivisions -- everything is done with the mouse; at some
    point the keyboard could just disappear; maybe even the mouse too,
    leaving only a remote :-)

Come to think of it, I probably should have asked for a tour of the
machine room during my job interview, but the schedule was so tight Jean
Catto had to get me to the helicopter pad for my ride to ZK by arguing
with the security guard at the pad's employee-only airlock.

I only remember the 70's, 72's and 73 in the machine room by '86 (plus
78's on the VAXen), but I don't know whether any drive types were
decommissioned there after '81.

TOPS-10 had grown by accretion for a long time.  (How many different
ways were there to make a system call to print a character on a
terminal?)  Also, TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 had independent origins - Tenex
was purchased from BB&N, not invented by neighbors of the TOPS-10 group
in the Mill or something.

TOPS-20 might well have been sufficiently evolvable to support TOPS-10
(look at the PA1050 compatibility package).  It would probably have been
a bad engineering decision to put TOPS-20 into TOPS-10 - it would be
like retrofitting all of Unix into VMS.

If you want to E and D the memory of your Unix foreground process, then
just add E and D builtins to your favorite open source Unix shell

ftp://ftp.gw.com/pub/unix/tcsh/

that just call ptrace(2)

That's fer sure.  When my friends picked me up at Logan the night before
my LCG interviews in Jan-81, I noticed that the Sumner Tunnel had
abbreviations (e.g., GV&CO) on the service hatches, whereas NY used
words (Gate Valve and Clean-Out).  I wondered at the time whether there
was some regional expertise in abbreviating that made DEC better than
IBM...

VMS has the concept of a page fault cluster - a fault on one page
prefetches the following k-1 pages in the hopes that they'll be
referenced soon.

Did TOPS-20 prefetch pages when doing PMAPped disk reads to reduce
latency for sequential input?

1.  Since unrecognized commands were searched for as .EXE files, lots of
such command(*) verbs couldn't be abbreviated.  If you can't abbreviate
commands, their names are either short and a pain to remember,
or long and a pain to type.

(*) Foreign?  Forgive me for using a VMS term.

2.  Because if you guessed seriously wrong then you
didn't find out until you hit return.  And at the time COMND was
written, there was no command history, so you couldn't recall the
command to add a few more characters with editing commands.  Furthermore,

I've got a few old DEC power controls that include mercury filled

my FORTRAN IV assignments on a BE100 Beehive terminal, and ended up as
systems manager responsible for the phasing out of the 1099. It
occupied a big part of my life in some very important years of it, and
I'll always miss it.)

Barbra, you must be an incurable optimist by saying this. My 
everyday's experience is a bit different. 

True the seductive power of knowledge; I can't live without it!
Once you learn acronym RTFM your on the why of becoming the sorcerer.
Also true that it is harder today to RTFM since none almost exist.
How I miss old DEC and IBM manuals.

We had one of those go bad.  The FE replaced it with an ordinary house

I would never sully DECtape by mentioning magtape.  DECtapes

stomp them, leave them in the car and drive through desert
to the polar ice cap.  And besides that, I could wear about
15 of them, leaving my hands free for typing or carrying

In fact it was - I just checked and it wasn't a "DECsystem-2020" but a
"DECsystem-2065", that makes it a KL10, right?  This particular unit
had 2MW of memory, loads of disk and other stuff - and 768(?!) serial
lines.  Too bad it didn't survive the 1993 clean-up... A co-worker,
who is in critical position in our data communications department, and
a capable TOPS-20 systems programmer, managed to threaten the
management to keep it in the machine room for 1989-1993, by stating
that every other worker has a personal computer, too, his personal
computer just happens to be larger than theirs.

From my rotten memory, I believe it was around 1980. When did the KS10
make it's debut? I think they almost bought a KL10, but the KS came
out just in time...

It was an RP06 pack with a big white label on the side that said
"RED" and had nothing to do with our KS10 named "red". I booted it
once late at night, and much to my suprise up came TOPS-20 (4.1 I believe).

The operator told me it was for Field Service and NOT TO TOUCH IT - which
instantly made me want to see what was on it...

It very well may have been. But, the one I saw booted a KS10 into 6.03.
Software Maintenance? That's why we never got 7.x, and probably wouldn't
have run it anyway. We (my boss) had alread re-written LOGIN, LOGOUT,
INITIA, ad infinitum, to be more secure. The fact that I got around
his security enhancements made him hire me.

The God of all things, Gerry Damm had a way of getting almost ANYTHING
from any corporation. We never understood his successes... How he got
5 KS10's to replace the KA10 was amazing in itself - BOCES is a state
supplemental-education department in New York. Notorious for not having
any money. In the last ten years, we found out why, as the top guy
in the department left with millions of dollars in a retirement package,
and left behind his rented apartment, his leased car, his clothing 
allowance, et al. Sheesh, if it wasn't for him, we could have
bought 5 KL10s!

My rotten memory again: From what I remember, getting TOPS-10 6.03
to run on the KS10 was an internal project to BOCES III. I don't
think they had any outside help... however, ADP may have related
how to do it, or someone from DEC (with Gerry's coercion) coughed
up the ADP modifications - I swear I remember a KSSER.MAC in 6.03

MIC existed in 6.03. That was the way I was noticed by the consultants
running the KS10's... I used it to "break and enter". I was later 
commissioned to write a "secure" version - and did... 

As for VTTECO, we had no need - all the schools were using LA36 and
LA120's, the few video terminals we had were used at the site, and
they were NOT VT100 compatible - Real VT's were too expensive. I
spent some time making TECO behave better with these terminals -
and I'll be damned, but I can't remember what brand they were. It will
come to me at 3AM while I'm in bed.

Intriguing, though I can't find exactly that.


30 was the crash word - poke it nonzero for a crash:

XPP CRSHWD,30		;NORMALLY THIS WORD WILL BE 0.  IF IT IS ACCIDENTALLY
			; OR PURPOSEFULLY OVERWRITTEN THE MONITOR WILL
			; ATTEMPT TO SAVE THE AC'S AND THE STATE OF
			; ALL DEVICES, THEN HALT.   [A LA 407 RESTART]

See http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/pdp-10/TOPS10_704_MONITORANF_BB-X140C-SB/S.MAC
for other cool low locations.


However, I see every CPU had once-a-jiffie and once-a-second dispatch
variables (COMMON.MAC):

CWRD (STO,SC'N'TIC##)		;;SCANNER ONCE A TICK ROUTINE FOR THIS CPU
CWRD (ISR,SC'N'SEC##)		;;SCANNER ONCE A SECOND

I don't think they were intended to be dynamically user-frobbable,
though a whole lot of devices were serviced periodically from those
routines:

SC'N'TIC::SE1ENT
	TTSTRT(M'N'TTG0,DL0TQ'N,DL0STO)
	TTSTRT(M'N'TTG1,DL1TQ'N,DL1STO)
	TTSTRT(M'N'68L0,CC0TQ'N,CC0STO)
...
SC'N'SEC::SE1ENT
	TTSECN(M'N'TTG0,DL0DSP)
	TTSECN(M'N'TTG1,DL1DSP)
	TTSECN(M'N'68L0,CC0DSP)
...


On the other hand, I once wrote a user-mode jiffy interrupt routine
APRENB.  It checked to make sure that the stack pointer hadn't
overflowed with an ``ADD P,[n,,n]'' - unlike PUSHJ, etc., ``ADD P,''
wouldn't cause a PDL overflow trap.

Unfortunately, the idioms

	MOVEM	17,SAVEAC+17	; Free AC17 for later use
	MOVEI	17,SAVEAC	; BLT pointer (AC0,,SAVEAC)
	BLT	17,SAVEAC+16	; Save the rest of the AC's
-and-
	MOVSI	17,SAVEAC	; Get ready to restore the AC's
	BLT	17,17		; Restore AC's 0-17

are tiny windows when P can justifiably not be a legal PDL, and the
code would falsely report PDL overflows if the clock ticked while
BLTting ACs.  It was surprising how quickly that flaw surfaced, but at
least it was a good learning experience.

In the early 80s a friend run an 11/70 for Geo processing. He
started on an IBM, then moved to using the KA-10 at UWA.

On day one, his new boss gave him the code to a report and asked
him to change the printed header fruit for another customer.
"So you have something to do while you find your way around."

Well Chris sat down and started to read the Phonebook, and
since he did not have a copy of the code, descided a print out
was a good step one. So he RTFM... and RT, and RT, then Cursed
the FM and did a $JOB, $PRINT, $EOJ to have the errors tell
him what the stupid manual was hiding.

And back came his printout... He wandered about in shock
for a day, then started to wonder how he had ever put up with
the IBM.

It's not a joke.  The particularl photoelectric paper tape reader I have
doesn't have a sprocket to advance the tape, just a pinch roller and
capstan.  The reader reads the sprocket hole in order to clock the data
transfers from the data hole, and hanging chad on the sprocket hole is
rare but more likely than on other holes (the sprocket hole is much
smaller than the data holes, and as a result, wear in the punch die is
likely to lead to hanging chad there before on other holes).

Low speed readers use a sprocket to advance the tape and a mechanical
sensor to find each data hole.  High speed readers with sprockets tend
to poke the hanging chad out of the hole after a few passes, but with
just a pinch roller and capstan, it's quite possible to end up ironing
the chad neatly back into its hole.

Yes Joe it was the Intersil 6100 micro which accepted the PDP-8
instruction set. I might even have one somewhere. I did quite a bit of
programming in FOCAL, loved the structured language. same programs
worked well on both my work PDP-8/S and the KL-10 at Univ of West
Aust.

We understood that and had no problems with the basic KS10's.
The tape drives (TU45) were forever being worked on, the disks (rp06)
were flawless, and the KS10's themselves never coughed once.

One of the systems had some problems upon installation that they
never figured out - when rebooted, it would KAF (Keep Alive Failed)
a week later, and then run flawlessly for 250 days.

If we had any problems, we debugged it first, determined that it
was hardware, and called our FS guy who was actually on site for
one day a week. We had a good relationship with him and never had
any finger pointing.

We weren't clueless... thank God!

We had a whole farm of RP06s that worked well for several years, and
then suddenly they all had head crashes.  After a lot of head-scratching
our FS guy figured out that the foam rubber around the well had decayed
and started to flake.  This happened everywhere at once because all the
drives were from the same manufacturing run.  He went to the hardware
store and bought those hard rubber strips you put on screen doors to 
replace the foam with, and after that we had "smooth sailing through
the 80s".

Hmmm, well actually I guess in some ways there has progress.  No more
rooms full of washing-machine disk drives, no more machines that are
hypersensitive to tiny power fluctuations (just the other day the lights
went out in my office for about 5 seconds, but all the computer stayed
up).  I remember being really excited every time one of the 20s would stay
up for more than 100 hours.  I think the record was in the 200s (no PM
that week).  Now there's an HP workstation in my office that has been up
for 827 days.  (Gee, it seems like just yesterday when I booted it...)

At one point, they had dropped the level of support, and DEC no longer
came in to do PM. After that, the one KS10 that always gave problems after
a reboot was running for 300+ DAYS. I had a SYSTAT showing it, but my cat
did a despicable act on it... It was running TOPS-10 6.03, not TOPS-20 :)

I have UNIX machines running up to a year, but never one for 800 days!
I can't keep my hands out of any machine for that long... my record for a
SunOS sparc-10 was 450 or so...

I seem to remember there being lots of problems with the BLT
instruction on the real KL, too.  Quite a few cases where the firmware
didn't get it right the first (few) times.  Kept Mike Uhler busy for a
while  :-)

What an understatement.  The thing I remember most of that bunch was
the rubber band ball, and the contests to increase its volume the most
in any given month, circa 1980.

The contract signed when starting to work for DEC causes this
while under that contract.  There were also papers signed
when exiting Digital but I don't know their contents.
I assume that the jobs these guys went to also have some
binding agreements.  After all, the engineers were hired
for their knowledge and experience.  Another aspect of
hardware engineering is that people didn't seem to stay in
the same team like we did in the software group.  There
was probably very little comraderie based on product history.

The record at Berkeley was over 70 users on an 11/70 with fixed head swap
drives and 2M of main memory. Admittedly it was a little slow with that
sort of load, but it could handle it better than the VAX. 30-35 users was
more typical.

My AT&T UNIX PC has a GUI and it ran with as little as 512K RAM total...
and no VM support, so porograms over 100K are damn rare. Mine's loaded
now, with 2 whole megabytes of RAM... which was mindboggling for a personal
computer in the mid-80s.

Dropping down to *real* single-user machines, the Macintosh was just coming
out about then with 128K and its own GUI.

I believe that Xerox was able to stuff Smalltalk into a Z80. 64K with a GUI.
That's pretty good.

I worked on a KA10 with over 120 users at once, most of them in
BASIC. Swapped like a bastard, but it was still quite usable.

Bloatware - that's the problem - bloatware.

Thanks to Microsoft, everyone has the attitude "hardware is cheap,
memory is cheap - just throw hardware at it, and you have a reasonable
machine". I come across that with Oracle weenies especially - even when
the machine is a Sun E10000 and it's full of CPU's. You should see the
look on their face when you tell them you can't, the damn thing is
full and there is no larger machine (from Sun, anyway).

I was spoon-fed the notion that the smaller you make a piece of
software, the better - it runs faster, takes up less room (equating
to less money for hardware). Plus, you get the added bonus of
having fewer bugs - less code, less chance for a mistake.

Windows 2000 was released with what, 65000 known bugs that were
"non-critical"? Yeah, right.

I'm sick and tired of bloatware. F**K microsoft and any of the
other trade-rag-reading stuffed shirts who believe their marketing
hype. I can't count how many times I've had customers say they
want to use NT, even for mission-critical applications.

I'd love to develop a 72-bit PDP-10 in-a-chip with a real 72-bit wide
PHYSICAL address space (yes, 72-bits of address at the CPU pins,
none of this mamby-pamby stuff going on these days - the biggest SGI
has what, only 48 bits or so of PHYSICAL addressing?

Sorry, I just stood in line returning one of my son's toys, so I'm
a little ragged :)

Most of these guys were compiling Pascal programs, plus a little C.

I suspect their bug counter maxed out at 65535.

Boggles my mind. I'm worried enough about running SCADA (not-very-real
realtime) on Tru64, and it's got a realtime scheduler available. When
people start talking about moving it to NT I get real nervous.

The Evil Empire has the following two characteristics:
 1) They are relentless in everything that they do.  If you're in their
    way, you had better get out of the way because they'll run right
    over you if you don't.
 2) They listen to what the customers say they want, and they make that
    thing, no matter how idiotic it may seem to the engineers.  Office
    is not the way it is because Microsoft engineers want it that way;
    Office is the way it is because that's the form that will sell the
    most copies.

It's amazing how closely they pay attention to what the customers are
saying.  It's almost as if they had a corporate policy of "if you hear
someone making a comment about a missing feature in our software, make
sure that feature is in the next release."  No wonder Evil Empireware
bloats.

DEC, Apple, and other companies which have fallen by the wayside in spite
of great technology made a number of mistakes.  They dug their own graves.

The first and foremost is that they did not listen to their customers.
In many cases, they were *damned* arrogant.

Consider the crap that DEC inflicted on its customer base in response to
the PC revolution.  The Rainbow, which wasn't even a color machine.  The
Professional (running the POS operating system, which everybody said stood
for "piece of shit").  The GIGI, which the Atari 800 ran circles around.

I remember being appalled to hear that the Rainbow's editor could only
edit files up to 64K.  When I pointed out that I routinely edited source
files that were much larger, the DEC marketdroid told me that I must be a
poor programmer since "nobody needs to write files that big."

Then there was this business, starting in the mid 1970s, of aggressively
discouraging new customers from buying PDP-10s.  The ridiculous pricing.
The deliberate withholding or delaying of new compiler versions.  The
crippling of the KS10 to be limited to 512K (sheesh, we're only talking a
handful of wires here) and not have extended addressing.

Don't get me started about Apple.

I don't think that Microsoft is wonderful.  I think that the other guys
were idiots, and Microsoft won by not being idiots.

Actually, Microsoft was involved in selling hardware for a while.
Remember the "Microsoft Softcard", the Z-80-on-a-board for the Apple II?

It even came packaged with a non-Microsoft OS, CP/M.

(OBDisclaimer: note that I said that Microsoft was selling the hardware,
not designing or building it.)

Well, not quite all the customers.  They actually sent an official Education
Representative to my office (not just me, making the rounds at Berkeley CS),
and I told him to make the Help feature work even if you have your colors set
to white on black, and that was many years ago, and it still doesn't work.
(You might think that given the helpfuless of MS help messages it would be an
improvement to see them in black-on-black, but the trouble is that third party
software developers use MS Help too.)

>  The GIGI, which the Atari 800 ran circles around.

This gave me a smile.  At my high school computer lab we had both GIGIs
and Atari 800s as graphics terminals for our Unix machine (because we
got them both free -- graphics terminals cost way too much back then).
The Ataris were definitely easier to program, but the GIGIs had better
resolution, so you could edit text on them, too; the Ataris were useless
for text with only 40 columns.  And the GIGIs came with that cool
screen print feature.

The quickest and dirtiest way to do forks/threads was to run everything in
a shareable high-seg and start up "children" by logging in a PTY, running
the program and detaching. IIRC, there were other ways to launch other
jobs, but the easiest (for me, at the time) was to use a PTY and DETACH it.
This was under 6.03 TOPS-10.

This allowed you to run as many threads as you needed. They all communicated
using the shareable high-seg, and kept their private memory in the low-seg.

I employed this method while developing WINDOW - a home-grown networking
daemon. It used to bug the operator when he did a SYSTAT, too many WINDOWs!

I still have one.  Actually it has a small single-masted sailboat
rather than a clipper ship.  The Sail says "10/20".  On the other
side of the cup it says Large Computer Group.

The sailboat allusion was to "Smooth sailing through the 80s", LCG's
slogan, laden with irony.  Here it is 2001 and my cup is in fine
shape but I don't see any large DEC computers in the neighborhood.

Ah, bars.  Now there's something I know about.

The Case and Eight was a down and dirty/slimey/peanut shells on the floor
kind of place.  My kind of place.  They'd periodically varnish over the
cigarette
burns on the bar, gave it a nice "distressed" look.

Years later, it got remodeled (my neighbor, a contractor, did the work) and
turned
it into a "fern bar".  Got named "The Gathering".  Food was better but lost
the
atmosphere.

It stayed that way for a couple of years before becoming "Rocco's".  The
only thing
constant was the deplorable shape of the roof bar (and the roof "public
facilities").

Ah, memories.

I never was much of a "P" person although they had great hamburgers, charred
on
the outside, dripping blood on the inside.  Ummm, boy.

JMF, TW, BAH, and I spend most of our time in the Oxford.  Lots of SMP got
debugged on napkins in that place.

<grin>  OK, ol' man.  I can't remember..I didn't drink there.

Tape Prep was having a group lunch at [not Russo's..the other
place..Alphonso's?].  Somebody was leaving or something.  We
were at the end of the meal when a drink showed up in front of
me.  The waitress pointed out some guy that I didn't recognize
as the buyer.  It turns out that JMF, on his way out the door,
bought me that drink as thanks for typing up his spec in record
turnaround time.  He thought it should have taken two weeks to
type and I did it in two hours.  Of course I used five times more
fingers than he did.

He came to the Tape Prep office after 17:00 so everybody had
gone home..except me.  I took his job submission, yakked with
him a couple of minutes to figure out how important the job
was, and typed it up.  I can't remember if I hand delivered
it. Sometimes I did to save the guy walking and getting-lost
time.  (A lot of guys would say that the job
was real important, needed a turnaround time of -4 days, and
then took two weeks to pick up the output.)

Yeah. That is right.  I attended Gallaudet College (now University) in
Washington, DC area
from 1984 to 1990.  I graduated from Gallaudet University and received a
degree in computer science.  I know who is the head of Gallaudet computer
service - John Milikin (sp?).   DECsystem-10 system was retired in 1988.
Yes, I seem recognize his name (John Woo).

I was aware of about added commands on system.  TOPS-10 was modified by
Gallaudet for adding commands, etc.   For example, operators can run 'BASIC'
without 'R' in PPN [100,*].
However, we can't enter as 'BASIC' so that we have to type 'R BASIC' to
enter.  TOPS-10 operating system was upgraded to v7.03 from v7.02 in 1987.
Operators lost their access but
had to run 'R BASIC'.  One of operators, Reggie Boyd, asked me for help.  I
searched for
information through HELP *.  I found a command called DECLARE.  I type
DECLARE
BASIC=SYS:BASIC and tried to run BASIC without 'R'.  It worked so well.  I
explained him about.   He was so happy.

It looks like that a hacker from MSSD did.  Perhaps his name was Scott
Steinbrink.  I heard that
he broke into system and stole his passwords.  He did logged into system by
using MSSD
adminstrator's account after he stole his password by using REACT or so.
Yes. that was so horrified!   I am glad to hear that Gallaudet suspended his
TOPS-10 account for good (infinitely).   Later, he told me his testimony
directly.  Later his account was suspended for one year for troubling other
users through Gallaudet's VAX system.  Later he was suspended for one year
and was asked to not touch Gallaudet's soil for another one year (worse).

Sure.  I was not casting aspersions on operators.  I commenting
on the fact that a really secure, 100% infallible system cannot
allow humans to make a decision....hmmm...I may have to rethink
this one; Misoft's proved me wrong.

>They didn't really know what was going on inside the operating system
>or the applications.  

Most of them learned how to do all of that stuff.  I've always
thought that one of the reasons TOPS-10 was so beloved was for
this exact reason.  Anybody could learn anything about the
hard/software.  

>So why give them the ability to read or write
>any file, patch the monitor, etc?  

They had to know the magic incantations to do those things.
We did not try to make those actions hard to do because
most of our customers needed to do them.  Remember, that
the philosophy of TOPS-10 was "gentleman's timesharing".
The penalty of screwing around was eliminating access to
the system; most people didn't want to give that up because
they were allowed to learn and do computering stuff that
users of IBM systems never even knew existed.


>You've just left yourself open to
>Trojan horses and the like. 

So?  We just get more paranoid.  Look, either you allow users
or you limit users.  My attitude is that limiting users just
makes them more destructive.

Since the FILDAE is something that gets started at boot time,
it's quite easy to detect a bogus FILDAE.  It was a [SYSTEM]PID
and one had to do a lot of screwing around to defeat an already
running FILDAE.

It depends on the site.  All of our operators did quite a bit
of systems programming work.  A number of them actually learned
programming while babysitting the machines.  In our shop, an
operator's job slot was an entry point into the company and not
a dead-end job on the technical side.

Sure.  Level D.  It stopped the operator from logging in
under [1,1].

Most of those features that you claimed weren't necessary had security
in mind.  You can't have it both ways.  The minute you let
a human into the machine room (nowadays, the entry is via things
like Java), all bets are off w.r.t. 100% security.  That's life.

I suppose I should change the subject line, but the paper tape reader (PTR:)
needed maintenance too!  C-MU did its own system maintenance on the PDP-10s.
Once I complained about the PTR skipping characters, possibly when it stopped
in midread.  One of the diagnostics tested that.  First it punched a tape
with alternating rubouts and NULs that you could splice into a loop.  Then
you put it in the PTR and the diagnostic would read with pauses to force
the tape to stop.  The test was a success if it got the same alternating
pattern and the lab folks told me it ran just fine.

So I dug a little deeper and found I wasn't missing just one character at
a time, but two.  I wasn't terribly kind to the lab folk....

I really liked the Mylar tape we had to reboot the IMP when BB&N called
to say it had crashed in a fashion they couldn't handle remotely.

Which is the perfect seque into the quote i realized I forgot to include:

	"The only thing worse than fanfold paper tape is
	non-fanfold paper tape."

The IMP boot tape was a roll, but at least it didn't tear if it jammed!

Your not wrong! I'd just put a mylar tape back in, and a machine

Right.  One of the Tape Prep girls once dropped a humungous
roll (I think it was one of dianostics' big jobs).  Before
she could _carefully_ gather it up one of the fork lifts drove
over it.  And then you guys wondered why we learned to swear.

I remember 514/546's boot tape wearing out.  The lead operator
had a terrible time trying to get an official replacement.  
For some reason, we always had problems getting SDC to do 
in-house ships.  I don't think I ever figured out the magic
incantations.

Riiiggghhhttt.  TW had to teach the -10 to dribble little bytes
to a PDP-8 wannabe.  First they made the guys work through a
PDP-11 to debug, then they made TW have to work through a mini to
write disk data.  This distributed nonsense was not an improvement.

No, it was in a purpose-built computer room in the basement of our
building - the same one we use today. But at the time, they put offices
for engineers/programmers/operators/training sessions within the
computer room. So there was a lot of people-traffic through the place,
bringing in dirt, etc. And we have a very high humidity climate here,
which the A/Cs couldn't cope with because of the amount of time the
doors were left open. I'm told that the combination of dust and humidity
combined to attack the transistor leads. 

Alan Coulter (Director of 1972) said that he got all the engineers and
techos to pull out all the boards, and scrub them down in the kitchen
sink. They then replaced all the transistors on the boards. (I think
that there are still lots of spare DEC transistors downstairs, if
anybody needs some!) He then got the offices removed, and enforced
strict policies on who could get into the computer room. And there
weren't any more problems.

I have MPEG'd a ten-minute movie made to publicise the opening of the
Computer Centre in 1962, when our GE225 arrived. (That machine is still
fairly intact, in storage, by the way.) If anyone is interested, I'll
make it available.

You've only gone to two levels and you think it's annoying? :-)

  There is a program called TELNET to get to another CPU.
  Control up-arrow is the escape; it's doubled to send it through,
  and "quit" is control up-arrow Q. 

  A hacker once used TELNET to get to another CPU.
  He knew he could quit whenever he wanted to: all he had to do was type
  control up-arrow Q. 

  Instead the hacker used TEL-NET to get to another CPU.
  He knew he could quit whenever he wanted to: all he had to do was type

  control up-arrow [at i-th time, repeat 2^i times] Q.

  [repeat verse n times; the choice of n is free] 

  The hacker soon got bored with this, and wanted to get back.
  He sighed, and started the exponential popping of the stack: 

  The hacked flushed the TEL-NET to the most distant CPU:
  He couldn't log out until he had killed them all,
  counting up powers of two: he typed
  control up-arrow [at i-th time, repeat 2^(n-i+1) times]
  Q. [repeat n times] 

  Whew! 

  The hacker's eyes were bloodshot; his fingers, black and blue;
  He wanted to log out and and go home to bed, and sleep for a day or
  two.
  He typed L O G O U T ... carriage return ... 

  The hacker was on a network with only twenty CPU's.
  But if he had telnetted to them all,
  he would not yet be through with typing
  control up-arrow [repeat 7 times]
  Q! 

Tim.

In my mind, Dark Side of the Moon will always be associated with a netizen
who used the moniker UNCOLA on the ITS systems at MIT.  I think that he
may have worked at HP in Palo Alto.  I forget his name, Peter something I
think.

He committed suicide sometime around 1977; I think that it was just before
I moved to the Bay Area.  Took cyanide I think.  He left an electronic
suicide note in his MIT-MC FINGER plan file.  It contained part of the
lyrics from Dark Side of the Moon, and concluded with "I'm committing
suicide today.  See you on the dark size of the moon."

It was, at the time, quite shocking.  I don't think that anyone saw it
until after he did it.

Eric Peabody put in a fix to answer an SPR.  The builds
didn't work.  When the guys (JMF and TW) came in that morning
after the edit, they spent most of the time getting the stuff
put together.  Then the monitor wouldn't run.  And the edit
was so extensive (it touched just about every module in the
monitor), they couldn't drop back to the previous week's 
SCNSER.MAC as a workaround in order to work on their changes.

The fit hit the shan, and, as a solution to the growing problem
of HOSS putting in edits that didn't work, the Tuesday morning
MCO review process was established.  If a person from HOSS
wanted his edit to go into the sources, he had to show up
and defend his edit.  He also had to show up after the monitor
builds and make sure his edit worked.

The unbelievable thing about this fiasco is that Eric knew
better since he had been one of the TOPS-10 monitor developers
3 or 4 years before that.

You hit the key point.  It's not the processor which is the most important
issue.  It's the Operating Systems that run on it.  Of those OS's VMS is the
important one.  Tru64 is quite honestly of limited importance as it will be
one of several UNIX varients.  VMS is something unique.

With all due respect, although the loss of Alpha is deeply regrettable
some of us do not mourn the demise of VMS at all.  There are still very
bitter memories of the attitude of the VMS developers towards those of us
in 36-bit land.  The thought that VMS may end up languishing in even
greater obscurity than the 36-bit operating systems is quite comforting.

Far more good things from the 36-bit world made it into UNIX than into
VMS.  True, a great deal was lost.  But at least the UNIX developers made
a half-hearted attempt to use some of our technology.  The VMS developers
flatly rejected us with contempt.

DEC destroyed what it was to bet the entire company on VAX and VMS.  Let
that stand forever as a monument to short-term thinking and long-term
blindness.

I'm sure that VMS was a very good upgrade to RSX-11.

VMS never achieved more than an "also-ran" position in the Internet world.
To those of us in the Internet (and before that the ARPAnet), VMS was
useless.  There was a tribe of developers that build Internet software for
VMS, but VMS never became a major player.

The PDP-10 operating systems, particularly Tenex and TOPS-20, can take
comfort in having created that world, and that there were high-profile
systems on the Internet based on the PDP-10 into the early 1990s.

I don't see any successor to UNIX (by "UNIX", I include its clones such as
Linux) on the horizon.

Win2K nee WinNT is not that successor.  It is an interesting operating
system in its own right, and it has quite a few desirable aspects that its
destractors are unaware -- underneath all the Windows stuff is a well
thought-out operating system! -- but it isn't in any way a threat to UNIX.

We are much more likely to see the Evil Empire offer Linux Office, or even
Microsoft Linux.  Don't laugh.  If they think they can make money doing
it, they will.  I'm sure that Office for some form of UNIX will happen;
whether or not they get in the UNIX OS business remains to be seen.

What will eventually overturn UNIX is something that doesn't exist yet; a
revolutionary technology.  Something like what GNU promised in its early
papers before RMS discovered that he wasn't actually capable of writing an
OS (hence his glomming onto Linux).

So has the Evil Empire.  At least one TOPS-20 OS developer is there now.

Although Tenex and TOPS-20 can take credit for being the pioneering
Internet systems.  I still believe that Unix systems did quite a lot to
popularize it.  Maybe not initially with TCP/IP capable nodes, though the
4.xBSDs did contribute a lot there, but when the UUCP based networks were
grafted onto the net, things really started to take off.  At least in the
way of there being widely available e-mail and USENET news without the
higher costs of PDP-10 systems and dedicated lines.

I believe Unix will survive, but in what capacity it's hard to say.  
Microsoft has gotten to point now where they control the desktop, and too
some extent they now control the fate of the net.  They can develop closed
proprietary standards and the world will be using them by default.  With a
subscription model it becomes automatic, every year people renew their
software subscriptions and are fed new updates.

What is there to prevent them from obsoleting any open standards which
currently exist?  If you control 80-90% of the market, what incentives
do you have to interoperate with anyone but yourself?  

They're a monopoly pure and simple.

By the time Tops-20 got involved, the ARPAnet was pretty well populated.
While Tenexes were the most common machine, Harvard and CMU ran Tops-10
with shared software (later Rutgers and someone else joined), Stanford
ran an OS that started from a Tops-10 predecessor, MIT ran ITS, of course,
and PARC ran Tenex, but not on a PDP-10.  No pioneering work on the ARPAnet
was done at DEC.  When I joined in 1974, I lobbied to adopt the ARPAnet
protocols, but didn't know how to work the system.  I was probably too late
anyway, folk like Stu Wecker and other early DECnet people were well
convinced that DEC needed proprietary protocols.  In many ways, they were
right that DEC didn't want IMP-like beasts frontending mini computers.
However, protocols like FTP and TELNET certainly could have been implemented
before the DECnet equivalents.

BSD, by being readily available, enabled dozens of new computer companies to
reach market without having to write a new OS from scratch or port one
from assembler source to another.

The subscription model for WinXP Office seems pretty expensive.

IBM was a monopoly, look what happened to it.  The biggest difference
between IBM and Microsoft was that IBM provided stellar support.

Monopolies persist only with government support.  Microsoft built theirs
by undercutting the competition's prices until they were forced under.
They can't do that with Linux!

SGI tried getting on the NT bandwagon - look where it's gotten them.

But they're pretty much forcing people to adopt it.  I wouldn't be overly
surprised if they're taking the approach to deliberate over charge people.  
Then they can start to bring the price down to make people feel like
they're getting a better deal.

And that's something that IBM still does extremely well in comparison to
everyone else.  SGI does too... or at least they did a year or so ago when
I was last involved at a large SGI shop.

> Monopolies persist only with government support. 

Which, given the recent over turning of the MS break-up decision, they
seem to be getting.

> Microsoft built theirs

> They can't do that with Linux!

No, but they can still effectively FUD it out of use in many corporate
environments.  At least that's what they've taken to doing recently.  And
as someone else here mentioned about bean-counters, they're making the
technology purchase decisions.  Of course they're also the ones who listen
to Microsoft.

With all the anti-GPL and anti-OpenSource propaganda, it's not a good sign
of the things to come from Microsoft's marketing machinery.  They do at
least support the BSD license, which I'm a fan of myself, but it's obvious
that their support of it is purely because they can take code from BSD
licensed works without any obligations to it.  As they've done with the
FreeBSD networking code they use in their OSes.

The BSD license doesn't force the issue of being a good OpenSource
citizen.  The GPL on the other hand binds one to be a good citizen--which
I think is valuable.  I do like the fact that the BSD license is more
attractive to commercial interests, but it's irritating to see someone
like Microsoft use this to their advantage when they've already so many
other advantages.  But then, that's what makes them a successful business.

I doubt Microsoft would think as highly of the BSD license if suddenly it
were changed to specifically exclude Microsoft from using the BSD license
code.  I mean, Microsoft has recently declared that no GPLed code can be
used at all with some of their recent SharedSource initiatives.  Would it
be possible for the BSD license, or a version of it, to explicitly forbid
Microsoft and it's subsidaries from using any code licensed under it? :-)

> SGI tried getting on the NT bandwagon - look where it's gotten them.

Yeah, IMHO SGI double-whammied themselves by taking too big of bite trying
to assimilate Cray while simultaneously spooking their loyal customer base
by putting out those initial WinNT PC.  That seemed to be when the start
of the end of SGI began.  I think a wiser move at that point in time for
SGI would've been for them to more seriously focus on selling mid-range
Unix servers for business use.

Exactly.  GNU's attitude with regard to open source can be put as "it's
our way or the highway."  If you subscribe to the GNU philosophy, you take
a completely black and white view of the world.  It makes no provision for
reasonable people to disagree.

Like most philosophies with a blank and white view of the world, GNU is
more concerned with burning heretics at the stake than in promoting the
cause it supposedly stands for.

What has GNU accomplished other than to recreate a 1970s proprietary
environment in open source?  Actually, GNU didn't even do that; GNU needed
Linux for the kernel.  But Linux is not the great wonderful OS described
in the early GNU papers, that would have all the winning features from ITS
and TOPS-20 plus move on to the future.  Linux is just a really good
re-implementation of UNIX.

I don't intend to defend Microsoft; let Bill Gates pay his lawyers to do
that.

On the other hand, dealing with Microsoft has been like a breath of fresh
air compared to other certain vendors, current and extinct, that I have
had the misfortune of having dealt with, including those which are at the
forefront of M$-bashing today.

Mind you, this isn't so much about how good Microsoft is as it is about
how bad their competitors are.  One of the secrets of their success is to
be less evil than the other guy, and to be a known quantity.

As a consumer, I look out for my own interests, and I choose MS when they
offer me the best choice.  I am not going to pay more money for inferior
product and inferior service, not even for the privilege of not dealing
with the Evil Empire.

I simply can't muster any sense of regret or outrage when the Evil Empire
crushes an even more evil mini-empire either.

This isn't to say that I like MS.  I'd prefer to deal with vendors that
aren't evil at all.  But that seems to be about as likely as the repayment
of the French war debt or Bob Dole's inaugural ball...

I did!  I'm talking about 1974, I think that was even before Abbott
Labs started using ANF-10.  When I took over ANF-10 development it was
the most incredibly buggy piece of crap code I'd ever seen on -10
or -11.  It was a lot better by the time I left, but it still needed
a lot of work.  It was '75 or '76 before I got involved with ANF-10.

Digital dropped NT on Alpha, they kept selling NT on x86.  Ditto Compaq.
SGI could sell NT, they're back to Irix but are so far behind the
Unix development race that they are now a niche player.

It sure looked like that's what VMS was intended to be, especially as you
had to use RSX commands to do half of anything useful in the earliest
versions of VMS.

Then again, all that hexadecimal cruft -- very unnatural for DEC which was
the Kingdom of Octal -- suggested IBMification virus.

It was truly amazing to me from the start that anyone would want to use
VMS if they had any alternative; and as DEC got more into the "it's the
VMS way or the highway" mode long-term DEC loyalists started fleeing to
UNIX in droves.

You might be surprised to meet some members of VMS engineering :-)
Many of them take the view that they were prevented for years from
implementing features in VMS because of management policy rather than
sound logic. In the last few years much of this has changed but
whether it is all too late for an O/S that Compaq seems to be
reluctantly porting to IA64 remains to be seen.

I hated VMS in the early days but it hasn't stood still and some of
the last remaining engineers in the good old DEC tradition still hang
on there. I'd still rather be using a TOPS-20 continually developed
though.

This is getting rather unwieldy.  I am going to prune
a lot of text to concentrate on just a few threads.

[J_Sauter]
I was the project leader for EDT version
3, which shipped on several PDP-11 operating systems
and VMS.

[BAH]
And there's no way a bug in EDT should stop monitor
production cycles.

[J_Sauter]
And you are quite right, no bug in EDT ever effected
the monitor.  However, a change in the semantics of
an obscure file system call could break EDT, if EDT
was using it.  Thus, EDT needs to change its code to
correspond to the change in the monitor.

...

[J_Sauter]
there is no such thing as a bugless set of
software (longer than about 10 assembly instructions)

[BAH]
Nope.  Even one instruction can buggy; think about that
instruction exercising a monitor bug or a hardware glitch.

[J_Sauter]
I agree that a one-instruction program can be buggy.
My point was that it is possible for a program
shorter than about 10 instructions to not have any
bugs.  I actually saw this happen once, on the PDP-1.
Steve Russell coded a subroutine to print a number
in decimal.  When he sat down to debug it, he was
flabbergasted to find that it worked correctly!
This was around 1964 or 1965.  I have not heard of
anything like this happening since that time, but
even one case proves my point.

...

[BAH]
When do you freeze C?  Before or after the monitor freeze?
But wait, the monitor is coded in C.  So the monitor is
dependent on C getting stable.  But wait, we can't build
a C without a monitor freeze.

[J_Sauter]
I had a problem like this on the Burroughs B-5000.
The Algol compiler was written in Algol, and so needed 
a working Algol compiler to compile itself.  The 
solution was to code the compiler in a subset of Algol.
When changing the compiler you make very sure that
the subset does not break.  This isn't a very satisfactory
solution, I confess.

Here is an attempt at a better solution.  You start with
a system containing only field-image software.  You
compile and link the new linker on it, and replace the
field-image linker with the new linker.  You then
compile the assembler and all of the compilers used
by the monitor and layered products, link them using
the new linker, and install them on the system.

You then assemble and compile all the rest of the
software that will be in the release, and install it
on the system for testing.  If something turns out
to be broken in the linker, the assembler or a 
compiler, you fix it in source, re-install field-image 
software on your test system, and start the process over 
again.

What do you think?

...

[J_Sauter]
In a complex software system with many dependencies,
what would sort of software discipline would you like
to see with respect to field testing and releasing
new versions?

[BAH]
We were working on it in PDP-10 land.  And, despite my
self-inflicted feather in my hat, I think we were getting
pretty damn good at it.

[J_Sauter]
Could you go into detail?  Most of what you did
was after I left.  What I mean by more detail is
a list of rules that you would like to see followed
by a software development organization that wished to 
ship their product.  For example, "the linker must 
compile and link correctly using field-image software."

No, no.  You didn't read what I said.  I said that no EDT
bug should stop the production cycle.  That includes the
case if it's true.

Nope.  That breaks backwards compatibile and should be 
very carefully considered how to "fix" it.  The monitor
people have to think about all the EDTs installed out
in the world.

No it doesn't prove your point.  You're trying to argue out

This isn't possible.  You can't ensure that the subset 
doesn't break.  You can only ensure that the subset
produces similar outcomes to known tests.  

The problems I addressed were having a build produce the
same EXEs that a customer would produce.  More later.

You can't.  You're on a development system and the software
you are going to ship is going to be the _new_ field-image
software.  You have to ensure that the new field-image
will build what you ship.

You will not have the same checksums or FILCOMs of the EXEs
with this.  We discovered that the minimum number of builds
for a product to build itself without a difference in the 
EXEs was three times.  And that was with MACRO.  We never
did investigate if it was even possible with stuff written
in BLISS.

It's nice if you have a test system.  We didn't have that.
Our development system was the only system running TOPS-10.
In addition, while I was building the next field test tape,
we had to run new edits to test them before we froze that
code.  

Doing field test in parallel with development is not a simple
thing to do.  TOPS-10 figured out how to do it all on one system.

Nope.  The linker must compile and link correctly and
reproducibly using _WHAT WILL BE_ field image software.

If you don't allow that rule, there will be a mess in the 
field because everybody will be writing in bugs but you'll
never know what software bed they have.

That implies that there is a very strict enforcible rule
about bumping version, revision, customer version, and
customer revision numbers.

[J_Sauter]
I am reaching intellectual overload trying to track
this thread.  I have learned several things about
what Release Engineering does, and even more about
what it does not do.  The most important thing I
have learned is that the goal of Release Engineering
is to make sure that Software Manufacturing (SDC)
gets kits that will install on two kinds of systems:
(1) systems running (previous) field-image software,
and (2) new systems just being shipped to customers.

Have I got that right?

[BAH]
It was a very big blow to me that my procedures did not 
last after the first day I stopped working, despite the 
man-months I spent training people, telling them why...like
I'm doing here.  I consider this lack to be one of my 
biggest failures.  I never included intentional idiocy in 
my game plans. :-|

Include files.  Some days, I thought we had to extend the
extended RIB just to have a software base to build that stuff.
The more files one has to keep track of, the higher the probability
that one would be left off the tape.  And the split of the code
didn't make any sense.  There was a hardware reason to have
six EXE files for LINK (GETSEGs).  I never could figure out the
reason that one had to have so many files just to have CALL EXIT
program.

My brother- and sister-in law live one block over from the Maynard mill
building. DEC/Compaq is long out of there. 

The complex was bought by investors seeking to do some sort of managed care
facility. After some number of years, not much came of that, so now a mix of

When I worked in MRO2 I used to enter from the
third floor, so I walked by the guys assembling and
testing systems.  As I recall, when they got a
computer working they would ship everything they
used to the customer, even the cables.

Today, I find _myself_ doing that job.  When we get a
new PC, I do the final assembly, load the software,
make sure it works, then package it up to deliver
to the customer's desk, cables and all.  Of course,
my job is a lot easier: FA&T is much simpler for
a PC than it was for a PDP-10.  However, the principle
is the same, and I am better able to do my job for
having known what was happening on the third floor.

    Are you talking about the KLAD pack?  I don't recall the customers
receiving more that just a skeletal system, and I think that this was on
the KLAD pack or RED pack as it were.

    I also remember coming into MR-1 during the weekend, and having
to use the back entrance into the 2nd or 3rd floor, where they did the
FTA for the KL's, among other systems.  Sometimes, feeling like a
ghost down on the 1st or 2nd floor, I'd go up the FTA area for a smoke
and coffee break, and shoot the breeze with the technicians.  It became
apparent why it was called a "DECSystem" - they'd have (hopefully) all
of the pieces of equipment that was to comprise the finished system -
disks, tapes, printers and the like - together in the assembly area.  One
engineer assembled or at least supervised the assembly of the system.
Sometimes, especially late at night or on the weekend, they could use an
extra set up hands to help, and it felt good to get my hands dirty doing
"real" work for a change.  I also remember that the main power transformer
for the KL power supply weighed more than some short blocks I had
wrangled with.

    The people weren't just slapping together a piece of equipment.  They
were building a system, and the pride of worksmanship showed.

Yup.  That's how it ended up in the end.  I'm not sure about
the times when there was more than one guy to do that work. 
When field service came to me and asked for an easier way to
make a KLAD in the field, I had an awfully difficult time trying
to convince the guy that was doing that checkout that field
image software _had_ to be installed on the KLAD's SYS:.  He
was still using 6.03-style scripts to do the checkout.  If you
guys take a look at the last KLAD tapes we shipped, you will
find a manufacturing save set (or disk area) on those tapes
that I made especially for that guy so he could superimpose
his stuff over field image software.  

Just as a note:  the only work getting done at the time
was refurb work--we were no longer manufacturing PDP-10s.

The reason field service wanted a better way to make a KLAD
out in the field is because this guy kept wiping out software
that the field needed to do their work.  I could not train
the guy; he was firmly set in an NIH syndrome.  It was one
of the very few times when I had to put my foot down and
declare an edict.

    There was a "sort of" DEC supported emulator, called PA2040, I think,
that could handle a lot of the JSYS emulation used the Galaxy commands.
I had a copy of it, and had hacked it so that I could run MS/MM on TOPS10.
But, it was left at a former place of employment, alas.  But maybe someone
has the base code that I started with - I think it may have been on a "DEC
internal" tools tape...

SOS on TOPS-10 and EDIT on TOPS-20 were based on the same original
source but somebody decided to alter some of the command characters
between the two and I've forgotten which is which. You can certainly
list a range of lines if you know how in both. Does l on its own list
one line? How about "H" for help?. If I was sitting in front of SOS or
EDIT I'd work it out in a few seconds but its been so long...

Screen editors included:

Fine - FINE is not emacs
DOPE Display Oriented POP2 Editor (another emacs clone)
SIMED - an excellent screen editor submitted to DECUS by the Simula
people.
SED itself you mention


Undoubtedly others I've forgotten.

DOPE reminds me. A sign at ERCC Kings Buildings (Edinburgh University)
used to say: "Would all users please refrain form using dope in this
room during peak times as it slows down response time."

There were EMACS subset clones available for TOPS-10 (Richard Stallman always
referred to TOPS-10 as Bottoms-10 preferring TOPS-20 or ITS) Two I remember
were FINE (Fine is Not EMACS) and DOPE (Display Oriented Pop2 Editor).  At
least one or both had an EDT keypad mode. I wonder if these might be online
anywhere.

Funny story about DOPE. DOPE was written at  ERCC (Edinburgh Regional Computer
Centre - Edinburgh University. On a visit their circa 1981 I recall a sign in
one of the main DEC-10 terminal rooms saying "Would users please refrain from
using dope in these rooms at peak town as other users complain it slows their
response time."

In an old version of MASM (Macro Assembler) for DOS, in an uninitialized
area of memory, I found a TOPS-20 SYSTAT output. I have to see if I can
find it ...

And, if you knew what you were doing (like setting the read-only
switch on the drive) you could even fool the -10 into mounting
each individual pack by itself.  This was the method used
to do a fast backup of a file structure using DSKCPY (I think
that was the name of the CUSP).  The program copied the pack
to another pack bit for bit, including the errors.

Remember B1FF?
That was me (almost).
The West PC-800 was the first Norwegian computer that was 'BBS' ready,
and within reach for 'normal' people.
But, in its basic config, it did not have lowercase, so
WE HAD TO TYPE IN BIG CAPITUL LETTERS LIKE THIS AND WE DIDNT SPELL TOO 
GOOD EITHER.
Also, it did not have ,, (eh, I hope yours have)
So, someone called ystein would soon discover that the 0 (zero) had
a bar through it, and so it looked like .
0(zero)ystein was born ...
Bjrn became Bj0rn ...
And Norwegians learned English from Black Sabbath, Terminator,Van Halen
and the like. So, B1FF THE WAREZ D00D was born, or so I believe :-)

All of our customers had strong feelings about what they ran.
If we didn't honor that feeling, we wouldn't have done so 
much business with them.  The trick was to "teach" them about
solutions that were outside of their scope with gentleness and
enthusiasm.  Somehow, along the way, we lost that when we got
hide-bound to The One and Only Solution which infected the 
middle management of DEC after a certain speech by a certain
idiot.

I have my own perferences, but that doesn't make others who
have difffering preferences wrong.  Mark liked TOPS-20 but I
couldn't tolerate using it other than stand alone since just
one other user would affect the resposnse time.  However, 
if I had a job writing user mode programs, I'd pick the -20
UUO interface in a nanosecond.

Every operating system has its pluses and minuses.  This is
because the developers of each operating system had different
problems to solve.  If the problems weren't different, there
would only be one OS.

They were successful enough that IBM provided first an emulator product (added
hardware) for the 360, and later a simulator (software) product for the 370; at
the University of Chicago, many parts of the accounting system were still 1401
code from the early 1960s until autumn 1982, when my office mate finished her
project of documenting the uncommented Autocoder listings. [1]

Besides, they were successful in another way:  I first learned to program on a
1401 with FORTRAN IV.  If not for that, I'd not be where I am today, and you'd
not have the opportunity to read this screed.

[1] She had made the mistake, in early autumn 1979, of going to the assistant
manager of the Financial Systems group and saying, "I don't have enough to do."
I'm fairly sure she erased that phrase from her vocabulary.

Folks,

Just started a thread on comp.os.vms about the VMS password dictionary, and
whether it originated on DEC internal TOPS systems. Anyone know?

For instance, we have MARLBOROUGH, MAYNARD, BOSTON, and LIVINGSTON (all DEC
locations). But no CLONMEL, so it predates the plant in Ireland. And no AYR
(it does have other 3-letter words...), so it predates the plant there.

We also have UNIX, DECSYSTEM and VAX (and VAXEN, but no VAXES :), and
VAXVMS.
But no ULTRIX, OPENVMS, or the short-lived name AXPVMS. Also, we have
DIGITAL of course (because it is a proper word in its own right), but no
COMPAQ. We also have ARPANET but no INTERNET or DECNET. And FOOBAR and
FUBAR,
but no SNAFU ;)

I've been able to trace it back to the Fall 1983 RSX SIG tape, in the
Software Tools VOS section as "smalldict".  VOS was a "virtual operating
system" and ran as a layer on a wide variety of hardware/"real OS's".

Folks, let's be reasonable here.

The problem isn't that MS used DOC for Word files.  Back when that
decision was made, nobody would have thought of reading a Word (or any
other PC application) file on a PDP-10.  Nor for that matter would anyone
have thought of reading a PDP-10 file on a PC.

It was perfectly reasonable for the PC to decide that all DOC files are
Word files, just as on the PDP-10 we decided that all MAC files were
assembly language source code.  We didn't give a damn about the file
naming conventions of other platforms either.  It's actually pretty
remarkable that Microsoft followed *some* of our conventions (e.g. TXT,
EXE).

The thing to bash Microsoft for is that today, in a world in which we have
networking and cross-platform file sharing, that Microsoft hasn't fixed
it; in particular, that Microsoft hasn't moved beyond the "the type of a
file is decided by whatever is after the rightmost period in the file
name."

We're not going to get much sympathy from Microsoft because they made the
same design decisions that we did.  We'll get much further by saying "you
guys claim to be doing the future.  Fine; that means that you have to fix
these extension dependencies."

Those of us who use UNIX can't be too smug either.  Some of these fancy
schmanchy file browsers for UNIX key on the string after the rightmost
period in the file name and change their behavior accordingly.  Even
though you aren't supposed to on UNIX.

Baby programmers can be found on any platform.

Barb, with all due respect, please note that I said PC.  DEC played lots
of attention to cross platform between DEC computers.  DEC didn't give a
damn about PCs until very late in the game, and when they did their
entries were jokes.  GIGI?  Rainbow?  P/OS?  (and you know how we expanded
*that* acronym, don't you??).

Couple that with the DEC corporate attitude.

I still remember a DEC salesgal at DECUS telling me that I was a very poor
programmer for having source files larger than 64K (the largest size that
the editor on the Rainbow could deal with).

How many non-DEC platforms were regularly surveyed and considered?

And I seem to remember that VMS recycled some PDP-10 extensions for its
own purposes.

Naming conventions on old operating systems that by then were dead, on a
vendor that was clearly in a downwards spiral?

What's surprising is not that there are conflicts (as with DOC), but
rather that so many were preserved.  In face, a commonly-heard criticism
of MS is that they kept too many DEC conventions instead of changing them
to something that made more sense.  I can't think of anyone who actually
likes the use of \ as the directory delimiter, but that was done to
preserve the DEC convention of / for switches.

I'll repeat my earlier assertation: use of the string after the rightmost
period for a file type is archaic and should have been rendered totally
obsolete long ago.  This is one of the few things that MacOS got right.

The entire problem with extensions on MS platforms today is *NOT* that
they conflict with the PDP-10 (let's be honest, very few people care any
longer) but rather that it overrides defined Internet typing mechanisms
and provides fertile ground for security breaches.  That problem would
exist even if MS rigidly adhered to every DEC naming convention ever
established, even the most obscure ones from the PDP-15.

There's plenty to bash MS about, but incompatibility of file extensions
with the PDP-10 is not one of them.  I wish that it were, but it really
isn't.

This is a page using various control line-printer codes to effect
