   I can't help wondering if he was thinking of the PDP-10.  It has
   indirect addressing bit (not exactly a mode) which can be nested.
   
   The last DEC designed PDP-10 CPU (codename Jupiter) was killed after
   (among other things) the designers noticed that indirect addressing
   was hard to pipeline, and that it's use was important when writing
   extended addressing (for access to more than 256K of 36-bit words).
   
   I was in the meeting where someone from the Jupiter team gave a talk
   to the FORTRAN group on how to generate fast code for Jupiter.
   
      We were making FORTRAN generate extended addressing code (which was
      used to create CAD tools for the Venus (VAX 8600) project which was
      going on at the same time, in the same building -- Venus and
      Jupiter were both behind schedule when Jupiter got the axe).
      FORTRAN generated instructions which used "extended format indirect
      words" (EFIWs) to specify addresses longer than the 18-bit offset
      in the right half on an instruction.  Traditional indirect words
      looked like instructions (and were called Instruction Format
      Indirect Words -- IFIWs).
   
   But I don't remember if the killer point was raised in that meeting or not.
   
   In retrospect, I don't see why you couldn't detect and handle a single
   level of indirection without breaking the pipe.
   
   I also don't see why we couldn't have made FORTRAN use indexing alone
   for extended access.  It might have required keeping base registers,
   and doing address arithmatic explicitly....

How about more info on Jupiter? There is so much UL around it

From memory, I can tell you what I know for sure, I left before
they cancelled it.

The design team was small, especially compared to the major
vax efforts at the time (Venus and Comet). My count is:
Program manager, tech director, another manager, memory guy,
2 microcoders/simulator guys, 2 cpu design guys, 3 I/O guys, and
one tech.
The manager was Ron Bingham.
A "contract" was established with corporate to develop a 
machine that was 5X faster than the KL. The KL was considered
a 1 MIP processor by our math back then.  The goal was to provide
a new cost curver per mips by supporting 5 times or more the
number of users.

The design team folks who had done 10 work before ncluded the 
microcode/simulator folks, the memory guru, and two of the I/O
guys. One I/O designer had worked on the KS10.  The two CPU
designers had not done PDP10 CPU design work before.  They had done
IBM Mainframe compatibilbe work.

The way we divided up the I/O was one guy did the massbus interface,
one did the I/O box, and I did the console.  The I/O box guy left 
so I got that as well as the console.

Fairchild had come out iwth some 100K ECL parts that seemed to be
able to be turned into a pipelined PDP10 cpu based on a set of 
microengines (horizontally coded micros). The concept of a pipelined
machine, running 10 code was novel to dec.  The engineering budget
for the effort was relatively small, with a target manufacturing
cost of the CPU at about 50K in 1980 US dollars.  

A simulator was constructed based on the SUDS designs.  Microcode 
based on the design was developed.  Tweaking the simulator and the 
microcode, a couple of design changes were worked out that added a 
microengine and identified a kicker that we called a mid life kicker,
an accelerator.

The cache design was four way, set associative, and theoretically 
projected a hit rate up to 97 percent.  The memory box did a 
quad word fetch to increase the apparent speed of the system.
An 8 word fetch was discussed but with memory prices at the time..
it was shelved but would have allowed a bit more performance,
theoretically.

Testing with the simulator showed a conservative 10X perf of the
KL.  We were thrilled and jumped on the other boxes to design.

I based the console on the Fonz-11, 11/23 CPU, and worked with 
George Lord in small systems to create a minimal chip implementation
of the glue logic around the F11. We came up with a mealy state
generator based design that allowed george to use the same chips
in a follow on PDT, and me to construct the console.  COnsole was
modeled on the lines of the KL console BUT with more diagnostic paths,
like the IBm 43xx family, a small winchester drive, remote field
service support, microcode load capability for the engines, and 
automated prefailure tracking alerts. The idea was to look for changes
in the system operating parameters so that we could project a 
failure and get FS to have the part there on time.

The I/O box that I designed was a fairly simple 100K ECL to TTL
and TTL to ECL converter.  The memory box bus that I interfaced
with was straight forward, limited length, synchronous bus, with
the proper ECL drivers, layout rules, and all that.  The I/O device
bus was a simple synchronous variation on the omnibus, wider, 
shorter, and lots faster.

Gordon Bell, Vaxland, and the committee pulled one of our cpu designers
to help boost the performance of the venus effort - it was not in the
same range as our simulated results, with a much larger investment.

When we had our 12 meeting in 2 months to explain the concepts of our 
design, the writing was on the wall.  When Bob E was pulled, that was
the posters going up that we would be delayed and then killed off as
sacrifices for the vaxen.  That is why I picked the name Hephastus for
the KC10.

Testing with the simulator showed we could tweak the balance of the
machine between low compute/high I/O and HIGH compute/Low I/O.
The simulator gave us numbers in the range of 50X the KL.  Simulating
1000 users, we could just barely keep the system busy. 
BUT THAT WAS THE SIMULATOR.

Fairchild still had to deliver the parts to build the engines.

Now, folks who stayed at DEC have told me stories that the machine 
did not properly implement all of the addressing requirements of 
the 10 running Tops.

That is my story.

Great.  By the time I left Field Service there were so many
stories about the cancellation due to it not running at the
correct speed...

Among the rumors was mental breakdown of the only engineer who
understood the internal design of the E-Box.

(Which was pretty difficult to believe, knowing DEC's methods of
doing things...)

By the time rumors got to Field Service they were pretty wild.

Among them (the dual microcoded Jupiter/Venus box) because of the
36 bit datapaths in part of Venus.

(Was there plans to use the I/O subsystem on both machines?)

There were rumors that the microcode - which controlled the 
balance between io and compute - was hosed and could not hit the
balance.  Another more credible rumor was the addressing was not 
handled properly for all cases.

My most cherished memory was when we discovered that a 
jrst0, jrst0 sequence caused the second jrst0 to be skipped, so the 
timing loops that used that trick were totally out of whack!!

I heard that story too, I was in MD by then.  Note that the
KC10 team was exceptionally small.  many times in the past the
folks who understood a piece of gear to the max was very very
small.  For example, KMC/DMC 11, there were 3 of us - Remi,
Paul and me.  DP8e, there were two of us, Remi Lisee and me.

I know we looked at how to do venus wit the ebox but the problem
was the instruction set.  PDP10 instruction set is fixed width,
the vax is variable.  that hoses the pipeline very badly.

No, the vaxbus, the 13.3MB/s bus was already designed and set.
The console was going to be looked at but...they wanted to use 
an 8080/8085 or 8086 as the console cpu.

IMHO asking about the Jupiter project is equivalent to rubbing salt
in the wounds of the old Dec people...and waving a red flag. It is
certain to get some of them to explode!!! You should have posted
a warning first:  "I am about to ask about the Jupiter project..."
Then the old Dec folks can prepare their blood pressure medicine
and refill their nitroglycerine prescriptions... Heck, I did *not*
even work at Dec, and hearing about how the Jupiter was screwed
could make me bust a gasket!!!

The most difficult problem with making a fast -10 is the aliasing of
the general registers into memory (locations 00 through 17 octal).
This makes it very difficult to do any reasonable data dependency
analysis, scoreboarding, register renaming, etc., because you can't
predict what registers will be live until the EAs of all preceding
instructions are calculated.

You'd pretty much have to do both register renaming and speculative
execution to get this right.  This is now relatively common practice
in state-of-the-art microprocessors, but not something likely to happen
in a home-grown FPGA implementation. 

Rumor has it that the Jupiter (KC10) hardware team planned to eliminate
the register aliasing, until the software people heard about it and
screamed bloody murder.

That was an earlier designation.  I have in my possession a number of binders
(in a nice chocolate color) with the words

	DECsystem-4050
	 Sales Training Seminar

printed on them.  (I got my first from Mark Lottor, at the 1988 DEC-20 Day
luncheon; the others came from Joe Dempster.)

So Jupiter was going to be a DEC-40.  Tops-40, perhaps?  After all, wasn't it
the sales/marketing folks who renamed the PDP-10 to be the DECsystem-10?

Jupiter (nee Hephastus) or KC10 (c for 100K ECL) was an instantiation of 
the PDP10 instruction set using 100K ecl components and a series of 
microcoded machines.  It was approved to support 30 bit addressing (CE 
or if you prefer CGB would not allow 32 bit addressing).
Venus was the next gen high end vax.  I don't recall which number it 
turned into 8xxx or soemthing.  I know Al helenius and Trygve Fossum 
wore working on it.

At the time, the differences between a variable lenght instruction and a 
fixed length instruction allowed us to project a much faster machine on 
the 10 side than the vax side.

30-bit addressing is the maximum in the PDP-10 instruction set.  You can't
have 32-bit addressing without changing the format of pointers, since you
need to fit in the global/local bit, the indirect bit, and the index bits.

Note that 30-bit addressing in the PDP-10 is equivalent to "32-bits plus
1" in a byte-addressed machine.  This is because the PDP-10 addresses
36-bit words and not 8-bit bytes.

If, as I propose, you use nonets to represent Unicode in UTF-9, you have
exactly as many nonets of address in the PDP-10 address space as you do
octets on a 32-bit machine.  However, UTF-9 is a much more space-efficient
means of storage than UTF-8.

Thanks, I was not sure of the numbering, I just recall it was late, had 
a HUGE staff compared to 2080, and had a target manufacturing price for 
the CPU of 50K.

Neither of them had anything to do with 30-bit vs. 32-bit addressing.  The
PDP-10 pointer word format limits it to 30 bits (but that's still more
memory than a 32-bit byte-oriented machine).

On the other hand, I would believe a limit of 27-bit addressing.  It is
relatively straightforward to extend from 23-bit addressing (the limit in
the KL) to 27 bits.  Instead of a 5-bit section table, you have a full
page (9-bit) section table, and page numbers become 18 bits instead of 14
bits.  There's a fair amount of surgery needed to the virtual memory
stuff, but it's relatively straightforward.

Getting those last three bits, though, are a nightmare.  To start with,
only 18 bits are available for the page number in a storage address; bits
12-17 hold the storage medium.  So that breaks immediate page pointers and
indirect page pointers.  It also breaks the page fail word which only has
27 bits.

I understand that XKL did this; they would have had to redefine how the
pager works and then change lots of stuff in the TOPS-20 kernel.

Bingo, but when that same sort of arguement was presented to the 
committee of consulting engineers, Bell's staff, the answer was no.
Yes, would have broken Tops 20. Yes, would have been a departure from 
PDP10 architecture in a subtle but majore way. Yes, it would have been a 
discriminator. Yes, we did use that ploy to get 30 bits approved.  We 
did spend a lot of time looking at how we could support the extended 
addressing in fortran.

I hope some of this discussion spurs some ofthe lurkers to pipe in here.

It was a less than pleasent experience having to stop work and prepare a 
briefing or presenation for a new set of CE crew while trying to keep a 
deadline.  It was not pleasent rejustifying over and over, the decisions 
made. It was fun when Ted Hess wore a suit and I wore jeans and a tee 
shirt. That kind of threw them for a minute.

Shortly before the cancellation, the 2080 had been renumbered as the 4050;
I have a marketing materials binder with the DECSYSTEM-4050 name right there
on the front for all to see.

Grump.  I never thought to scan it till just now; have to wait till I can get
it out of the storage locker.
