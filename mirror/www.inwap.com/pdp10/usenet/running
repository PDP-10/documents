It shouldn't be a real surprise, but yes there are -10s still earning their 
keep. One place is at ADP's Ann Arbor facility, if they haven't all been 
replaced with SC boxes. Also, I just heard that SPI in Cambridge, MA is still 
running a KS-10.

We Still have 12 KL-10 CPUs running at Lockheed Martin in Piketon, Oh,
in different configurations from Single System to a Quad SMP System.

We have been using tem since the late 70's, we have made modifications
to them cutting them from three cabinets to three. We have some very
special software which would take a long time to re-write so we have
looked at several "Binary" compatable systems from the SC Boxes and a
KL-emulator running on an Alpha, and several other systems which are
still in development.

Morning all!

In my continuing quest to make a KS10 that one can plug into house current 
(without causing the power meter to spin like a top), I came across a bit of 
a problem.

The "official" drives for the KS series seem to be either RM03's, or RP06's. 
RM03's pull at least 8 amps and only offer 70mb of storage. RP's pull way too 
much, and at 220 volts to boot.

Then I got to thinking. Here I have a few PDP11's running Fujitsu 2322 SMD 
drives with Emulex SC03 type controllers. Fujitsu's take almost no current, 
relatively, and can offer 160//320 mb per spindle with perfect RM02 
emulation...

Hm.......

So, does anyone know if it is possible to put a Unibus SC1x type controller 
in a KS10 and have it do the disk I/O to a 2322? If this is doable, it would 
elliminate one power hungry RH11, and several RM03's in my life. It would 
also allow me to slide 640Mb of disk into the KS10's cabinet, and make this 
thing a single box computer :-)

One KL-2065 and approximately eleven KS10s, D Bit Troy NY, John Wilson.
   KL-2065 status:  complete, supposedly working before move, no 3-phase here

   KS10 status:  mostly in various states of having been raped for parts

I'd also like to take this opportunity to take inventory of the PDP10s
out there.  Model, Location, Contact Name, Status (up, was running,

Two systems running Tymshare applications as of 16-Oct-98
  Model XKL, Fremont CA, Joe Smith (408)922-6220 or Carl Baltrunas
  (408)922-6206, running TOPS-20, up in our intranet.

One system donated to the Computer History Museum
  Model KL-1090, Mountain View CA, (I need to get their contact info),
  was running TYMCOM-X when decommissioned, may be missing disk subsystem.

I'm one with a KS; I also have a KL but not complete or working. I
have heard reports that there is a working large system (probably KL)
in private hands in Sweden - can anyone confirm? I'd also be

have been preserved - working or not, in museum or private collection.

Confused.

I'd heard ???Uppsala University??? had a KL/KI/KA up and running - or
rather their computer club did - something of that nature.

In their member newsletter Uptime (Issue 1) from 1995, the Computer
society of Upsala University - Update - claims to have two DEC-2060s.
That would be KL-20s. Their names were AIDA and CARMEN. The url
is http://www.update.uu.se/uptime/1995/1/ . (It's in Swedish). Their
website contains a map claiming that these are still there - crammed
into a corner of their terminal room. URL of map:
http://www.update.uu.se/admin/maps/Termrum.html. That page was
last updated in Feb of 1997.

Something tells me - don't ask what - that at least one of those beasts
is actually a 2065.

It's a pity they haven't the resourses to keep them running, though.

Regards,
Peter

There is currently no PDP10 system running in Sweden.  However,
some old systems, like a KA-10, 3 x KI-10, and various KL and
KS 10 systems are "preserved" (read: in storage).

There is a KS-10 system runnable (but not running) at the Stacken
computer club.

It isn't a matter of resources it's a matter of time. We have a 2020
and a PDP 11/70. They run, but you have arrange some more cooling and

There is a 3-CPU KI10 that still runs if you put your hands on the
right spots. That is the only working system to my knowledge in
Sweden. And yes, it has seen some days at parkinglots. But that was a
while ago.

When I worked iwth him, I believe Peter Lothberg (add your own
diacriticals ;-) had a KL-10 running at his house, but perhaps it was
only a KS-10...

Zimmerman just stated that KI-10 was runnable in Sweden.  He
does not understand the fact that these machines are STORED
in a warehouse.  There is a lot of shitty work to be carried 
out just to get them out, find the parts, and that does not
even include building a computer room, or finding the power.

Facts:  ONE runnable KS-10 in Sweden.   1 x KA, 3 x KI,
many x KL, some KS symstems in storage in Sweden.  The ones
in storage are NOT runnable right now.  They can be fixed
if anyone has much money.

   As someone who restores old iron for a hobby, I can state with some
degree of authority that it can be a real crapshoot trying to get a
machine running that has been "stored" for many years. My most recent
project was a PDP-12 which sat idle for about 8 years; I'm still
kicking bugs out of it, but overall it's surprisingly healthy.

   For comparison, the PDP-12 has a single backlane about 2/3 the
size of the KI backplane (of which there are two). In the case of
the KIs, the power supply filter capacitors may have deteriorated
by now and might require replacement (linear supplies - no switchers).
There's a lot of work to be done even before you try to put power
to a system, too. Just verifying that a machine is "all there" can
take several hours, especially in the case of a machine like a KI-10
which has close to a thousand boards it it. Then there are the "fun"
things that can happen over time (and movement) to wire-wrap panels.
And the jumper cables between the two backplanes. And trying to
find memory and peripherals.... You get the drift.

   Getting a -10 into runnable condition (leaving out the little
KS-10) is a major undertaking - much more that plugging it in and
flipping the power switch.

   The important thing is that they are safe and preserved in a
state which will allow them to be restored in the future. That is
the all-important "first step" -- that they not go for scrap the
way so many of their brethren did.

The Retro-Computing Society of RI will be featuring the DECSYSTEM-20 as the
topic of our November open house.  We will be doing some work on our 2020 and
2065 which we recently acquired.  Both systems are in need of much work.  It is
our goal to restore these machines to functional condition.

We are in need of the entire board set for the pdp-11/40 console on the 2065. 
Please contact us if you know where we might obtains one or more of these
boards.

RCS is located in Providence, Rhode Island.  
The open house is Saturday, November 20th from 10am - 4:30pm.
The event is free, and open to the public.

For more information and directions, 
see http://www.osfn.org/rcs/ 
or send email to rcs@osfn.org

The KA10 was still running perfectly in 1994 with many years of spare parts
remaining.  Unfortunately it was an embarrassment to management.  It was
torn apart.  The wirewrap backplane from one of the two CPU cabinets went
to a DEC serviceman's garage wall.  The rest was just disposed of.  All I
have left is an image copy of its disk packs, but that's all I need to bring
it back to life some day (given a softare KA10 emulater).

Possibly the Cambridge MA school system.  I know we gave ours to them
as a spare when we decommisioned it.

Actually, the story I have heard is that we traded it in for a VAX 780
years ago, and DEC let us keep it until we migrated our software off of 
it *if* we kept up our service contract.  It took us at least 10 years
to do so :-)

At the Retro-Computing Society of RI we are restoring DECsystem 2065
(KL-10E)  
See http://www.osfn.org/rcs/ for more info about the group.

On the front is a black switch labeled "SYSTEM" on/off and a red switch
labeled "SYSTEM LOCK" off/on.  The red switch does indeed have a U
shaped piece of metal that drops down when you press the switch up (to
the off position) which prevents the switch from being pressed back to
the down position.

But, if you open the door to the cabinet and reach behind the switch
there is a slim rectangular gap on the lower right side toward the back
of the switch enclosure.  By inserting a paper clip you can lift the
piece of metal while reseting the switch to on.

(I only discovered this just now after I had already removed the switch
and held it upside-down...)

KS10 serial number 4469.  I don't know if it's alive or dead yet.
I also got a TU45, and a spare formatter for it.  (Can I plug any Pertec
Unformatted device into that formatter and use it, or just special
devices?)

I am now in the market for a Massbus harddisk of some kind, within
semi-resonable distance of Peoria, IL.  Will trade PDP-11 stuff...
