I remember this quite well.  We had just installed our first DEC-20 in
1977 when our DEC salesperson brought a brand-new VT100 to show it off.
We connected it to a front-end port at 9600 bps, enabled smooth scrolling,
TYPE'd a file, and the front end crashed right away because of the flood
of Xoffs and Xons.  As soon as it came back, it crashed again, etc etc.

A similar incident had occurred previously when one of our programmers
fell asleep on the keyboard of his (non-VT100) terminal, causing the keys
to autorepeat.  When we complained to DEC about this vulnerability, their
answer was "don't do that".  Similarly for terminals that had a "page
transmit" function.  But when their own VT100 became the culprit, they
tightened up RSX20F pretty quick.

Nevertheless, the front end was very definitely designed with only people's
fingers in mind on the input side.  Even after the fixes, RSX20F was
markedly intolerant of large bursts of input.  Which is why the original
Kermit protocol enforced a 94-byte maximum packet length.

Around that time I came up with a hack to the TOPS-10 Monitor to do
both local and remote XON/XOFF processing.  If the terminal was in
packed-image mode, and XON/XOFF was enabled in the LDB, then when a
Control-S came in, I had it mark the line as being XOFFed and put the
Control-S character in the input buffer.  (Previously, it was one or
the other, not both.)  With the hack in, the smooth-scrolling VT100
could tell the local system to stop sending, and KERMIT (in connect mode)
could tell the remote TOPS-20 system to also stop sending.

I also had some help from Dawn Banks (who was working at DEC at the time)
on tweeks that could be applied to the RSX20F load image.

><snip two "I know that"s>

Remember, Barb, that the KS10 had a REMOTE DIAGNOSIS switch with three
positions:
  DISABLE = Ignore RD, CD, RI and all other signals from the KLINIK line.
  ENABLE  = Allows free acces to the system without password protection.
	    This is like the KL KLINIK; the lines wired in parallel.
  PROTECT = Allows access to the system with a password.
	There was a separate command you had to type on the console
	to tell the 8080 front end what the password was.  When the FE
	called up the modem connected to the KLINIK line, he would be
	asked for the password.  If it matched, the KLINIK line would
	be connected to the console.  If it did not match the line would
	be an ordinary terminal line.

I forget now whether the line was CTY+1 or CTY-1, but it did allow
logging in as a "normal" user (such as [6,6] or [6,10]).
