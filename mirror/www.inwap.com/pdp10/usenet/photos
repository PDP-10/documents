Somewhere recently (last couple of years or so) I've seen an old picture of a 
very young Bob Clements (RCC), but can't remember where. Actually there's a 
picture of me (http://www.wwa.com/~jeverett/racing/Sprite03.gif) taken in 
1972, when I was in the TOPS-10 Monitor Group. Picture's not PDP-10 related 
however.

There's also a picture somewhere of the KS-10 hardware team, but I don't know 
where that's located either.

I've never come across any other pictures of either the hardware or software 
development teams.

Look in the section "Developers, DECUS, People";

There's also a photo of Jim Flemming (JMF) and Tony Wachs (TW) in
front of a 1091 (KL10 in a short blue cab).

look down to 1978 for the 2020.
many photos.

There's a photo of the PDP-6 team.  I know I have hardcopies (one in a
DEC newsletter, and one in a glossy anniversary brochure I got Alan
Kotok to sign at his DEC retirement dinner).

I just put up a PDP-10 page of my own at www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/
which includes the entire LCG organization, taken on the 20th
anniversary of 36-bit systems (1984) and other tidbits I've collected.

I have some notes that must have come from some publication made that
year;

			Harris Hyman, Steve Pinar; MACRO
			Tom Eggers; DDT
			Bell Segal; Utilities
			Peter Sampson, Al Blackington; FORTRAN
			Ed Yourdon (yep, that one); LOADER

[Ironicly, I was working for Al Blackingington at the time, who had
returned to DEC, to work on .... FORTRAN!]

I found it, I'll try and get a better scan today.  Mine may be a
different photo.  The fellow in the lower right is blurred, like
he was moving his head quickly....

The photo also appears in the book, _Digital at Work_.  I don't have
it here with me, though, so I'm not sure whether the caption there
identifies who is who.

I think this should be Piner, not Pinar.

The reprint of the photo in _Digital at Work_ does identity the people.
They are:

  (seated)   Lydia McKalip, Bill Coburn, Ken Senior, Ken Fitzgerald,
             Norman Hurst, Harris Hyman
  (standing) Peter Samson, Leo Gossell, Gordon Bell, Alan Kotok,
             Russ Doane, Bill Kellicker, Bob Reed, George Vogelsang.

A cursory tour through the various PDP-10 and museum sites turns up
precious few DEC-20 photos, and especially not color ones.  The only
color marketing brochure I have left only a shows the logo and I
haven't been able to find any machine-room photos of our DEC-20s at
all, except the fuzzy black-and-white one here:

  http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/dec20.jpg

Who knows where I can find some sharp, colorful DEC-20 (esp. big KL)
photos to rival the PDP-10 photos at the Retro-Computing Society of RI?

Thanks.

There's a half-decent pic of my KS on my website:

http://www.corestore.org/DEC20.htm

I'll try to take some more next time I visit it (Christmas).

I've got a bunch of -10 and -20 brochures, many with colour shots...
scanning is definitely on my 'to do' list!

I just looked at your site, and I'm impressed!  That's some computer
collection.  I'd only seen the KL10 page before.  The KS10 pic is probably
the best pic of a hobbyist system I've seen.

Glad you liked it; you might like even more the new page I've put up,
http://www.corestore.org/kl.htm - it's not linked through the site
yet, it's just a quick thumbnail page including several new images of
my KL.
