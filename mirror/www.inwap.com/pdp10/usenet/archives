I'm pleased to announce that I've finally organized the PDP-10
related material in my posession and put it on-line.  At

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

you will find several hundred megabytes of TOPS-10 and TOPS-20
tape images (largely from Megan Gentry's efforts at rescuing
several KS10's in Cambridge earlier this year), individual files
extracted from those tapes, and several
hundred megabytes of DECUS TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 freeware.
You will also find, interspersed among the contents of that page,
numerous plugs for me and my capabilities to archive digital media
for the future, and my absolute dedication to exact tape images.

The TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 material is provided to aid those
folks who have accepted the terms of the 36-bit Hobbyist
license in fulfilling their responsibilities as outlined in
section 3.1 of that agreement.  Please see the full text of the
license at the above URL.

I'm open to comments, suggestions, criticism, etc., on the layout
of the archives and how they are presented over the web.  Fire away!
And if anyone has any material to add to the archives, I'm willing
to do whatever it takes to preserve this software.

It only took a little bit of effort (notably abandoning the Unix
date/time stamp, which doesn't go before 1-Jan-1970 UTC, and
switching to a system without so much lossage) to get
the date stamps on the PDP-10 freeware archive entries at

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

to be correct.  Now, if you go and look at a directory
in the TOPS-10 or TOPS-20 categories, you will see the original
date/time stamps as on the DECUS library tapes.  Take a look
at

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/www/lib10/0003/

for an example.

Thanks to a couple of old-timers who persuaded me that
I really shouldn't list the creation dates on these files as
being 1999, when this can be off by over thirty years :-)

Enjoy!

Actually, it'd be entirely consistent with the history of PDP-10
emulators.  I know of at least 4 fairly complete PDP-10 emulators,
one of which really boots and runs TOPS-20, yet the authors of these
emulators have yet to discuss technical details or release the
code.  There is another emulator under development, and its author
has offered to let me into an "exclusive club" of inner knowledge
about development, but only on the condition that I not discuss
the details with the world at large.  I refused membership in that
"club" because I don't like that attitude, though I really do give
my best wishes to the developer and attempt to help him out whenever
I'm asked questions by him.

Similarly, I know of several sets of TOPS-10 and TOPS-20
distribution tapes sitting in a basement or a storage space, in
probably rather poor environmental conditions, just rotting away because
the current owners don't want to share them.

It's a shame that this "my-my-me-me-mine" attitude exists, but
what's a guy to do about it?  The emulator authors are entitled to do
whatever they want with their own code, and the owners of a tape
can just let it sit there and rot away, and we can't force them to
share if they don't want to.

I've tried to change this attitude with the establishment of an
archive - 

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

- for distribution of tape and disk images for emulator development
(under the conditions of the DEC 36-bit hobbyist license)
but so far there have been exactly two contributors.  Not to belittle
the contributions of those two kind folks - we all owe our thanks
to the distribution tapes they've donated - but I was kind-of hoping
there'd be a more sharing attitude among the folks who posess the
materials.

Tim.

I *think* that the fourth file on the tape image in

http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/www/pdp-10/TOPS10_KS_BOOTABLE_BB-X138C-BB_704.ZIP

is what you want.  This is a 10BACKUP saveset containing SYSTEM.EXE:

 Start of Save Set: 
 Volume 1 written by System: RL375A DEC10 Development
 Written on: MTB0   at: 10-OCT-1988 12:53 using: 1600 BPI
 
 SYSTEM    .EXE        1236  7-OCT-1988 14:58
 
 End of Save Set: 
 Volume 1 written by System: RL375A DEC10 Development
 Written on: MTB0   at: 10-OCT-1988 12:53 using: 1600 BPI

You can access the individual files in this (and the other)
saveset by going to

http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/www/pdp-10/TOPS10_KS_BOOTABLE_BB-X138C-BB_704.html

Does this help any?  The first part of this tape is actually supposedly
bootable on a real KS, so you should just be able to mount the tape
image under your emulator and be on your way.

The PDP-10 archives at

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

are down for maintenance.  They are being migrated to a new disk, where
the numerous software donations received in the past months can be fully
unpacked and made available for browsing over the web.

Some stats: the "new" archives will have over 90 tape images,
roughly 1500 Megabytes in total.  All tapes will have unpacked individual
files whenever it is possible.  And I'm adding a makefile type utility that
will allow easier archives maintenance and eventually allow for
web-based indices and search queries to access the unpacked contents.

Congradulations, Tim!!! Thanks a heap for doing a job that DEC
should have done themselves over 20 years ago...archiving the
software for the older DEC machines. This archive is a great
resource, even for people who are *not* interested in the older
DEC machines. The archive gives insight into how programs were
written then, and what the editors and tools were like.

When I can get a DEC-10 emulator that will run on my Mac, I want
to run TOPS-10 and play some serious Adventure on it!!! Hey, if
we were *paying* you to create the archive, you could appologize
for being slow...as it is, everyone interested in this software
owes you a *huge* thank you!!!

Tim, Well Done!!! Congraulations!!  I already am downloading files in
progress.  Now I have complete TOPS-20 v7.0 includes complete sources.

Ok, I returned from my Christmas vacation and will resume my TS-10
emulator development soon.  I will work on KLAD to test my all
instructions before I release it to public and continue to extend
my emulator to KL10 implementation for TOPS-20 v7.0.

Thanks for the credit, Tim, but in fact these tapes were transcribed and 
provided by Tim Litt from DEC/Compaq.  Tim's been critical in many areas, 
including creating the original T10/T20 hobbyist license, and providing 
technical documentation of simh/10.

There are seven more tapes in the archives.  4 of them seem to form a
tape backup of a KLAD "build" kit, and have detailed instructions
(and presumably all the tools) needed to build such a pack:

KLAD20-AC-7.0-A
KLAD20-AC-7.0-A <UTILITIES>
KLAD20-AC-7.0-A FRONT-END-SYSTEM COPY
12-DEC-1988

KLAD20-AC-7.0-A SYSTEM-COPY
Tape 1 of 3
12-DEC-1988

KLAD20-AC-7.0-A SYSTEM-COPY
Tape 2 of 3
12-DEC-1988

KLAD20-AC-7.0-A SYSTEM-COPY
Tape 3 of 3
12-DEC-1988

The remaining three tapes are, from their names, diagnostics of
some kind, but I haven't yet figured out what sort of file structure
(if any) exists on them:

DDXLAK0

RED405A

RED405A2

I'm guessing that the last two tapes have something to do with the
much-mentioned but not yet materialized "Red Packs".  If anyone
figures out exactly what's on these last 3 tapes, I'd appreciate
a pointer to the tool(s) used to decode them.

As always, the good stuff is at

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

In particular, these new tapes are (for now) all lumped together
under the "KLAD" section.

Tim.

A few new directories have been added to

  ftp://ftp.trailing-edge.com/

In particular, four block-by-block "iso images" of the Freeware
CD's are now available over the net.  See

  ftp://ftp.trailing-edge.com/pub/cd-images/

Note that not all of them
are purely ISO-9660 images - in particular, the RT-11 volume has
7 RT-11 partitions at the end, and there is also an ODS-1 volume
of RSX-11 freeware available.  Whatever you want to call them,
these can be burned directly to a CD-R if you're too impatient
to fill out the free CD request form at

  http://www.trailing-edge.com/www/freeware.html

and wait for me to burn you a set in my copious free time.
(Actually I'm doing a pretty good job working away at the backlog
of requests, with 150 CD's distributed to 12 countries last week.)

When you do burn images, be sure to use whatever your software
calls "ISO Image" mode to do the writing.  I use the freeware
"cdrecord" software under Linux and OpenVMS, and here the command
line to do a 8x burn (to my CD-Writer at SCSI unit 4) looks like

  cdrecord dev=0,4,0 speed=8 rt11freewarev2.iso

There are also three new FTP directories which are loopback mounts
into the ISO-9660 CD images:

  ftp://ftp.trailing-edge.com/pub/rt11freewarev2
  ftp://ftp.trailing-edge.com/pub/rsx11freewarev2
  ftp://ftp.trailing-edge.com/pub/pdp10freewarev2

Most all of the stuff had previously been available over the
web via http, but I've slowly been convinced that wu-ftpd now
has had most of its seriously bad bugs pounded out of it by now.

Enjoy!

As announced over a month ago, I am migrating the PDP-10 archive 

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

from the large, heavy, power-hungry VMSCluster to a small,
lightweight, and efficient linux PC.

Ignore the relation to the VMS vs Unix vs PDP-10 thread that has
been taking up so much space in this newsgroup.  The main reason
for this migration is nothing more than power efficiency - I can
keep a little PC (drawing less than 50 Watts) up for hours on a
cheap UPS, while keeping the older cluster up for more than a few
minutes on a big UPS is a hassle.

Not only will the webserver and files reside on a different machine,
but there will also be a number of other changes:

1.  No longer will *.TPC (DECUS TPC-style, blocks are preceded by 16-
 bit block length) tape archives be listed.  The archive of tape images
 will be offered solely as as *.tap (emulator-style, blocks are
 preceded *and* followed by their 32-bit block length) images.

  Internally I will continue to use *.TPC tape archives for some
 purposes.  But my impression is that the emulator community is
 much better served by the *.tap style images.  If anyone disagrees
 with me, speak up!

2.  The compression method for tape images will change as well:
 Instead of gzipped (*.tap.gz), they will now be compressed with
 bzip2 and filenames will be of the form *.tap.bz2.  Bzip2 offers
 significantly better compression (10-20%) on these images, and
 it adds up when there are many thousands of megabytes of them.

  More bzip2 informattion is available at

   http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/

3.  The extracted files will now be prepared using the "backup10"
 and "read20" programs, which I have been patching up over the
 past month to the point that I am very happy with their capabilities.
 My patched versions of these very useful tools will be made available
 shortly.

4.  The web pages that index into the archives will be more CSS
 (style-sheet) oriented and less table-oriented.  I aim to make the
 resulting pages easily viewed on both graphical *and* text-based
 browsers.  At the same time, I will also be making use of
 server-side includes to make web site maintenance easier for me.
 (Read that as: if you point out an error on the home page, I hope
 to be able to fix it more quickly than the couple of months it
 now takes me to get around to it!)

5.  A site search engine will allow searching of the extracted files
 quickly and efficiently.

6.  An index of scanned and line-printer documents will eventually
 happen.

Many of the above elements can be seen already at the "test site",

 http://new-pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

but not all the above elements have yet been combined (for example,
as of Sunday morning the test site still uses tables extensively.)

The actual switchover will occur early in the morning of
21-Jan-2002 EST.  The old archive will remain up and going even
after the switchover at

  http://old-pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

for at least a few weeks, as I perfect the redirects and rewrites
of URL's.  Besides, if I shut the old cluster down at this time of
year the basement would get too chilly :-).
