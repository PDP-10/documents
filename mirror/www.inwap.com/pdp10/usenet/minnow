My understanding is that the Minnow never got further than running EDDT,
if that far.  It definitely never ran an operating system.

I recall being told that the Minnow lived up to its name.  When the first
board was given its initial solder, it dived into the solder pool!  If you
like, I can try to dig up the exact quote; I think that it was Pete Hurley
who said it during the 36-bit Trivia Bowl in 1986.

Trivia question: what was the slowest machine ever to run TOPS-20?
