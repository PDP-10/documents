Actually, once it started happening around 1977, ports to significantly
different architectures were done fairly fast. "Different" means
things like Interdata, IBM 360/370, DEC Vax, Univac 1100, Intel 8086.

I wasn't aware of "policy decisions" by AT&T that caused the work, not
counting the one that kept our paychecks coming in.  And
the original AT&T licenses were precisely those under which the important BSD
work in the 1980s was carried out, not to mention the growth of the
workstation industry.  (I don't by any means discount the BSD work, which
was enormously important, but the same important technical parts of
it were done with that not-that-nice license, though it did ultimately chafe).

"Good policy decision" could also mean "lack of bad policy decision."

Had AT&T behaved the way that DEC or Honeywell did, there would have been
no release of UNIX outside of AT&T until the 3B series was produced.  The
PDP-11, Interdata, etc. versions never would have seen the outside of Bell
Labs.  The UNIX license would have prohibited running UNIX on anything
other than a 3B system.

It isn't clear to me whether it was conscious corporate decision, accident
of history, or guerilla action on the part of the programmers.  You can
probably comment on this point... ;-)

The point is, AT&T behaved differently.  Either AT&T made a policy
decision not to restrict UNIX to AT&T-supplied hardware; or AT&T failed to
make a policy decision to restrict UNIX to AT&T-supplied hardware.  Either
way, it was possible by policy to port UNIX to other platforms.

And in the end run, that's what counted.

However, a policy (or lack thereof), no matter how laudable, isn't a
technical aspect.  Technically, there were other systems that were as
portable as UNIX; but policy blocked their portability.

I contend that policy is more important that technology in deciding what
succeeds.  VHS vs. Beta; Intel vs. Motorola;... history is littered with
superior technology that died because of bad policy of its owners.

UNIX had undeniably, overwhelmingly superior policy.  Technology is an
entirely different matter.  The claim that UNIX is unconditionally
superior technology to [Multics | ITS | TOPS-20 | LispM] leaves a bitter
taste for the erstwhile partisans of the latter.  It's the same reason
that a claim that VHS is superior technology to Beta annoys former Beta
fans.  It's the sign of a poor winner.

I know that you (DMR) have never been this way.  As I recall, you once
made a very gracious statement about Ray Tomlinson and Dan Murphy that was
much appreciated in the Tenex/TOPS-20 world.  I wish that I could say the
same about certain other individuals.

I mean, sheesh, not that long ago someone was insisting to me that UNIX
invented device-independent I/O and file/memory mapping!

That would be from the consent decree of 1956, which I believe was
from a suit between IBM and AT&T. It basically said that IBM wouldn't
do phones, and AT&T wouldn't do computers.

Well, I believe that 1976 was the end of the consent decree (though I
don't know why I believe that); one result was the release of a new
generation of Teletype terminals (the 40 series) to catch up with the
rest of the world. It was too little, too late, of course; at that
point, I think DEC dominated with DECwriters and VT100s.

*grunt* nobody's giving authoritative references, but hey, it's only USENET :-)

I think many of thought "that makes since" in light of the more recent
tit-for-tat posturing of the early 90s where AT&T was pondering
video on demand and challenging the cable industry,
and the cable industry wanted to offer phone service.

Here we are 10 years later and cable service still sux and is overpriced.
The closest they've come to telephony is offering cable internet,
which is STILL slow to deploy in most areas.
I can't follow the telecom industry as closely as I did but I believe that
AT&T did succeed in making video on demand technology which servers
niche markets.  Still no picturephone, though and the video/picture
phones were a flop.  Even videoconferencing seems to be a passing fad.

You want references?  OK, you get references.

John Brooks, _Telephone: the First Hundred Years_, Harper & Row, 1976:

  The agreement, or consent decree, settling the case was wrapped up
  in Washington right after New Year's Day, 1956....  First, Western
  Electric would not be separated from AT&T; second, Western Electric,
  except for its government defense work, agreed to confine itself to
  manufacturing equipment of types bought by the Bell System, rather
  than seeking other markets; third, the Bell System agreed not to
  engage in any business other than common-carrier telecommunications
  and "incidental operations"; and fourth, the Bell System agreed to
  grant nonexclusive licenses and related technical information to any
  applicant on fair terms.  (pp. 254-255)

The only history of IBM I have at hand is _THINK_ by William Rodgers,
Stein and Day, 1969, and it doesn't give any solid details about IBM's
consent decree.  But the text of the decree seems to be available at

  http://www.essential.org/antitrust/ibm/ibm1956cd.html

I can dig for more details if that's not good enough.

Geez, and both failed miserably when they tried
Rolm was IBM's phone system and IBM withdrew/gave up.
AT&T tried selling their own PCs and workstations usually
based on the WeCo 32xxx CPU and named 3b2/5/...:
AT&T tried selling Olivetti and Convergent PCs too.
All of AT&T Information System was totally disolved in the 90s.

I am still sorrowed that the Teletype brand-name was not maintained
since it probaly had more name-brand recognition than any other name!
I think you're right that in the 70s, Teletype machines were big
and clunky compared to the competitors, but they did some ground-breaking
work in the 80s with the BLIT, 5620 and other high resolution
graphic and windowing "smart" terminals.
And I used to have a stack of Teletype Dataspeed 40 chain printers that
were so rugged they refused to die!
And cheap to run too: used DecWriter ribbons!

There was another factor to Teletype's downfall:
they tried desperately to break into the IBM mainframe market.
They had IBM compatible terminal cluster controllers and terminals,
yet few places outside of AT&T risked the ire of IBM and actually
deployed them.  Many shops remained "true blue" using only genuine IBM
terminals and all despite the higher cost and being older technology.

The end of the consent decree allowed for me to work at AT&T:
I mostly consulted to AT&T's Information System:
developing the Unix OS and applications.
