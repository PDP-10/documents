+---------------

Yes, indeed. Actually, it emulated up to *16* DZ-11's!! (128 serial ports)

I should know, since I designed that board! Or rather, I architected it
and managed the 3-person team that designed/built it. It was basically
a Zilog Z-80 8-bit microprocessor, with a portion of its main RAM
used as 16 sets of emulated DZ-11 registers. Unibus PIO reads or writes
to "DZ-11 registers" caused a DMA on the Z-80's bus into the corresponding
portion of the Z-80's RAM, as well as an interrupt to the Z-80, which
then compared the emulated-register portion of RAM with a backup shadow
copy to see what had changed.

Most of the "DZ-11 register" state transitions could be emulated in
software by the Z-80, but a few things had to be handled "RIGHT NOW!"
during the Unibus PIO (a.k.a. Z-80 DMA). Those were done with a small
amount of external "hard" logic that masked the RAM data. That is,
we didn't bother doing a read-modify-write DMA cycle to the RAM, we
just stored an external hint in hard logic that modified the next
Unibus PIO read or write.

For example, it is an absolute requirement that if one Unibus read
gets the last character in the receive FIFO, then another immediately
following Unibus read of the receive FIFO location must *NOT* return
the "valid" bit (bit <15>). So any such read had bit <15> AND'd with
an external hard-logic "receive FIFO ready bit" for that DZ-11, turned
off the "ready" bit at the end of the DMA... and also interrupted the
Z-80. After processing the interrupt, dequeueing the next input byte
(if any) and putting it in the "receive FIFO" offset in RAM, the Z-80
would turn on the external "receive FIFO ready bit" for that DZ-11 again
(which was, of course, also coupled to the DZ-11 command/status word
and the Unibus interrupt request).

That was the DCA "SmartMux/205", if I recall the model number correctly.
A single quad-connector Unibus card, which emulated 16 DZ-11's (128 ports),
and which connected with the outside world through a single RS-232c
synchronous serial cable running DCA's proprietary terminal multiplexing
protocol. [Which, note, was based on DEC's DDCMP protocol, which we had
implemented from the public spec and shipped to customers before DEC did!
(*Tee-hee!*)  And by the way, a tip-o'-the-hat to DEC's Stu Wecker for
writing a *great* protocol document!!]

We sold a whole bunch of those to DEC-20 and VAX customers, and later,
to a few TOPS-10 KL customers as well (after "PDP-10" I/O busses stopped
being available on KLs).

Other miscellaneous trivia:

- It was the first board DCA had ever built using the then-brand-new
  "Multiwire" technology, wherein you gave a chip layout and a netlist
  to the board vendor, and an automated machine laid insulated *wires*
  down on the board (pushed into an adhesive coat). Since they were
  insulated, wires could cross over/under each other. After all the
  wires were laid down, some more glue was spread on, baked hard,
  and then the holes for the chip pins and other discrete components
  were drilled *through* the board, the glue (epoxy), and the wires,
  and copper was additively plated onto the inside of the holes (thus
  connecting to the wire ends exposed by the drilling). Finally, parts
  were stuffed, and the board was wave-soldered.

  Anyway, it was a new (to us) technology, and the schedule was tight,
  so we were *very* careful about checking the design and the netlist
  we gave them. Wonder of wonders, the very first board we got back
  worked the first time!!! (The 2nd failed, but it was a Multiwire
  process glitch.) All in all, some 11 or 12 of the first 15 just worked!

- At the time we designed the /205, DEC had a patent on the Unibus bus
  arbitration logic, and if you wanted to build a Unibus device, you *had*
  to infringe on the patent -- it was fundamental to Unibus arbitration.
  But the per-instance (or per-item) license fee they wanted was simply
  *outrageous* [we thought], $100 or 10% of the item's retail price,
  whichever was higher (IIRC). However...

  At the same time, the DECdirect catalog openly sold DEC's own Unibus
  arbitration chip -- which contained the patented circuitry inside it --
  as a "spare part" to anyone who wanted to buy it. And it was cheap,
  just a few bucks each. Since patents cover *manufacture* of the patented
  item, by buying DEC's own chip to use in the SmartMux/205, we could
  completely legally avoid paying the outrageous patent fee. [Or to look
  at it another way, we really "paid the fee", and got the chip for free!]

  Oh, and AFAIK, DEC's catalog sales people never bothered to ask why
  we kept buying so many of those "spares"...  ;-}  ;-}

+---------------
| But for the KL connection, we were still using the 680I, a PDP-8 based

+---------------

A real DEC 680I? ...or a DCA "SmartMux/250", which used an OEM'd PDP-8
all right, but with DCA-designed UART-based serial ports instead of the
680I's "software bit banging", and as a result could be populated with
up to 128 9600-baud lines!  That was DCA's first product, and the mainstay
of the business for a long time. It interfaced to the PDP-10 I/O bus
through a "bus converter" I had designed while I was working at Emory
University, which design DCA picked up (along with me, as it happened).

Originally we used the normal DC68 driver on the host, but as we got
asked for more features, I wrote a new driver from scratch that made
SCNSER think we were a DC76. Well, sort of a DC76/DC68 hybrid, actually.
Anyway, close enough that we were able to support "remote echo" on
terminals at the other end of our synchronous multiplexer links...

At BOCES III in Dix Hills, NY, I worked on five KS10's, each with a DCA 305.
Like you said, capable of 128 ports, Unibus based.

What speed was that serial link running at? We had setup 10 cross-over ports
at 19200 between the 5 systems (4+3+2+1). I wrote a file transfer protocol
and away she went! We never noticed any degradation of performance (of
our 9600 baud video terminals). The file transfer daemon did a dance, though boy!

My first experience with a PDP-10 was with a KA10 with a DCA/PDP-8 front-end.
I am told that it had 128 ports in it, and says DCA on the front (my friend
still has it in his basement). Based on a PDP-8/i? It's serial # 45.
Interesting to learn that the UARTs in it are not standard DEC equipment :)

I found the DCA equipment quite revolutionary in terms of mux'ing the serial
lines. When all the bugs were worked out of the OS, it was rock-solid.
There were many problems at first, but I think it was mainly the Z80
rebooting itself for no reason. Eventually, field service decided to 
replace the CPU and it worked flawlessly ever-after. I don't remember
the model # of the base unit, but the boards in the KS10's were definitly
305's (I think). 

IIRC, TOPS-10 6.03 had to be modified to recognize the 305's, or otherwise
clear up some conflict.

I could easily believe it. IIRC, there was some sort of metastability
problem with some versions of the DEC Unibus arbitration chip that we used
(that we bought as "spares", as I mentioned in my previous article). I had
thought it eventually had gotten worked out, but maybe not. The symptom
*would* have been a "hang", and, yes, it would have been *very* sensitive
to where you placed the card in the system.

[If my vague memory is correct -- and apologies to DEC if it's not!! --
the problem was a synchronizer metastability issue in the Unibus interrupt
grant logic, and such things were just barely beginning to be generally
understood in those days, with a lot of misinfomation & myth floating
around. We had a *bear* of a time figuring out what the problem was, and
an even worse problem getting DEC to admit anything. IIRC, the later,
better version of the chip had a "metastability-hardened" flop in the
synchronizer role.]

Actually, IIRC the original 205 could only do 9600 on the sync port, but

Well, you certainly have a valid point, but application loads do vary.
The "data entry clerks + line printer" I mentioned in my other reply ran

line, and they were perfectly happy with it.  Whereas I'm more like you,
I suspect. I wouldn't be happy sharing a 19,200-baud line with more than

For what it's worth, we used to have quite a large herd of DCA gear,

individual serial ports, 128 of which were cabled to cabinets full of
DH11s to feed a pair of 2060s (and later to sixteen DECserver 100s
feeding a VAX 8800, later still a 7000-620).  (Other ports were hooked
to a bank of IBM 7171 ADACUs to provide pseudo-3270 access to a 4381,

I had actually wanted to condense all of those sessions onto two X.25
lines run into a pair of DMP11s, but the plan was vetoed as having too
many things in it with which we had no experience.  What we wound up
with greatly resembled what we'd done earlier with Computer
Transmission Corporation equipment (the "TRAN gear") and those same
DH11s.

Not to argue, but somehow DCA got at least 128 terminals in a PDP-8/i
(serial # 45 - probably DCA's serial #) I understand that the UART's
or whatever equivalent were custom on this box.

This was used as a front end to a KA10 - BOCES/LIRICS - my friend
still has the PDP-8/i in his father's basement. And that PDP-8/i
combined with the KA10 was faster for terminal I/O than a KS10
ever was. And our KS10's used DCA 355's (?)

<ahem>  What was LOGMAX for that KA system?  I bet it wasn't
128.  My guess is that it may have been built for 40..maybe
60 jobs.  That only "allows" 15-30 connections through that
8/I.  If you want to look at the code that we shipped for
PDP-8s, look for DC72s.  I can't remember is we put the 680I
stuff on the Customer Supported tape.  Looking for PAL8.EXE
would help, too.

Yes, exactly, the DCA serial ports were muxed somehow. The setup was:

A High School on Long Island would "pay" a certain amount of money per terminal
per year. The school could get state money (NY BOCES) to "pay" for this, so
in the end, the school really never wrote a check to anybody.

Anyway, on average, there would be at least 4 terminals muxed over a point-to-point
line which was usually 4800 baud from the high school to BOCES III in Dix Hills.
If you were lucky they would give you an LA120 that could run at 1200 baud and it
would be the quickest thing you ever saw. And, I do remember that the LA120 was
available when the KA10 was still "the" machine. 

Originally BOCES had all these high schools (I am unsure of the number, but at least
30 w/4 terminals each) connected through the PDP-8i my friend has in his father's
basement, into a KA10, apparently bought used and had 256Kw of core.

At the height of it's usage, there were more than 120 jobs logged in on any given
day. I learned MACRO that year ('80?). At that time, it seems that they had
already been using KS10's for a little while, and eventually moved the schools
over to any of four KS10's with a fifth being used for the BOCES Business Office.

And, the 8i was used to boot the KA10, so it really was a front-end.

I once knew the people at DCA fairly well, but I have never heard of them
doing such a thing.  The issue at hand is that it's pointless.  The thing
that is bootstraped into the KA10 is not the operating system, it's the
disk bootstrap that will load the operating system.  Since every KA10 had
a paper tape reader and bootstrap built in, it's pointless to do it any
other way.

I also don't think that even a DCA device was able to write into KA10
memory unilaterally.  The KA10 set the DMA addresses, not the 8/i.

I keep mentioning it, but I have to again - this PDP-8/I was a piece
of DCA equipment. I have no idea what the original intent of DCA was 
in designing this thing - it's possible they meant it to boot the KA10.

The 8i was not a front-end.

It was merely a device that could respond to RIM (Read-In Mode)
which allowed the disk bootstrap program to be loaded from PDP-8 memory
instead of from paper tape.

Traditional boot:
  Set RIM device switches to the code for PTR.
  Put bootstrap tape into the paper tape reader.  The first segment
    on the tape is the RIM10B loader.  The second segment can be either
    a full-fledged BOOTS (a rather long paper tape with code that can
    accept a file name from the TTY and load the specified file from
    disk) or a short pre-boot that simply reads raw bootstrap blocks off
    of a reserved area of disk unit zero.
  Press the Read-In-Mode switch.

Non-paper boot:
  Set RIM device switches to the code for PDP-8 interface.
  The disk pre-boot has already been put into the PDP-8's core memory.
  Press the Read-In-Mode switch.
    1) Short read-the-boot-blocks routine gets sent to the KA with
       the PDP-8 acting like a virtual paper-tape reader.
    2) Said routine locates logical disk 0, reads in the first part
       of the disk bootstrap, executes it (which reads in the rest of
       the full disk bootstrap code).

This method simply saved wear-and-tear on the KA's paper tape reader.

My bad, I didn't realize Peter had used Telnet for the console.

Re PDP-8 terminal counts - the TSS/8 manuals (for the 8/I) offer
different maximum terminal counts.  The system operators guide says up
to 4 PT08s (dual interfaces), and the rest on DL8/Is, to a maximum of
32 users.  The monitor manuals says a mixture of PT08s and 680/Is, to
a maximum of 32 users.

A later version of the source (EDUSYSTEM-50) says maximum 20 users,
with one on the console, and 19 on either a terminal multiplexor, or
PT08/KL8's, or a mixture.

In any case, PT08s/KL8s consume device numbers at a rate of 2 per
line, so the system would be limited by device numbers.  Terminal
mux's like the DC08 would use only a few device numbers for multiple
lines.  The 680/I, which was a front end on early -10s, used the DL8/I
terminal multiplexor to achieve high line counts.
