You're probably thinking of Unibus, which is the PDP-11 bus.

Massbus was the host-independent disk/tape interface in common use on
high-end DEC gear from 1973 (?) to the mid 1980s.  It was later replaced
by other interconnects such as CI, SDI, STI, DSSI, and SCSI.

Massbus has an 18-bit data path, a 16-bit control/status path, and a
bunch of handshaking and control signals.  There are a total of 60
differential pairs to a Massbus.  Internal Massbus cabling uses three
40-conductor flat cables with the ubiquitous 40-bit Berg sockets.
External Massbus cabling uses twisted pairs, with connectors consisting
of three of the Berg sockets in parallel in a connector shell.

The data path and control/status path can be used simultaneously; once a
data transfer is set up, the the host can use the control/status path to
monitor the drive, seek on other drives, or prepare another drive for a
data transfer.

Note that although there is no electrical problem with putting disks and
tapes on the same Massbus, in practice none of the host software
supports it.  So most systems have at least two Massbus channels.

The KA10 and KI10 use an external RH10 Massbus channel.

The KL10 can use either the RH10 or the internal RH20 Massbus channel.

The KS10 uses a slightly modified form of the RH11 Massbus adapter
as used on the PDP-11 Unibus.

VAXen use the RH780 and RH750 Massbus adapters.

Commonly used Massbus drives include the RP04, RP05, RP06, RP07, RM03,
RM05, and RS04 disks, and the TE16, TU45, TU77, TU78, and TU79 tapes.

Yes and yes.  The RH11C is jumpered as a "bus hog" with some ridiculous burst
length, which is the only way it could keep up with the RM03 and RM80 (which
are officially not supported on the RH11AB since there aren't enough 3341s
to buffer a whole sector, or something like that).  The "disk" RH11C has to
be the only thing on the "disk" Unibus to pull this off.  But it's still
pretty weak, it would have been much cleaner if DEC had built an "RH2020"
or whatever, i.e. an MBA which sits directly on the KS10 backplane bus,
so it could have been faster, plus it wouldn't have had to get mired in
the Unibus map ugliness.  But obviously DEC didn't feel it was worth the
trouble for a low-end system.  So you get a pretty long chain for e.g. RM80
disk I/O on a KS:

backplane bus => UBA => RH11C => RM adapter => SMD personality module => R80

Each step of the way probably burns another 50 watts, too ...

Oh, _that_ thing.  I don't think I ever heard the guys refer
to it as a formatter.  Thanks, Joe.
