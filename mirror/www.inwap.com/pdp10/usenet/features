Some functionality was accessible through 2, 3, 4 families of UUOs.
Some utilities were written and replaced wholesale 2, 3, 4 times.

But some of the added functionality was to support concepts that
didn't exist when the original systems shipped, or wouldn't even fit
on the original systems.

Also, the TOPS-10 you remember was parameterized so it could be
configured with a bunch of software options.  Many parameters that
hadn't been turned on or off in ages were removed to simplify
maintenance.  Much of this may have happened after you last used a -10.

The following options were made mandatory:

OPSER was a PITA to use from an operator's POV.  
It was also geared for hardcopy and
almost useless for CRTs.  The whole GALAXY project was worthwhile
in that it eliminated MPB.  It also provided the programming
interface (which became a standard of sorts) for IPCF.
And we no longer had to fuck with OMOUNT.

They all ran on the KI :-).  Where do think they got debugged?
514/546 was our secondary system and ran those yellow packs.

Remember the green, yellow and red  system packs?
