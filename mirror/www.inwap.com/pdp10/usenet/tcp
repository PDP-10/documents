I may be wrong but I don't think the distribution tapes were
encrypted.  The .key files were required when updating layered
products.  There may have been a couple which required them in
Autopatch days.  When we went to full file replacement with
TSU (post TOPS-10 7.04/TOPS-20 7.0, circa 1988,) .key files
were sent out with the last set of layered product distribution
tapes.  There were one or two products which had bad .key files
and thus required the creation of special tapes with just the
proper .key file.  The encryption wasn't very strong so I'd expect
someone who knows this stuff and had the .key file, an encrypted
update file, and the decrypted updated file could crack it with
today's systems.  I think you are right about sources using the
same mechanism.

In case anyone is interested, most updates in Autopatch days,
especially for layered products, involved [FIL]DDT patches of .exe
or object modules from libraries.  Bundled products with sources
often had the equivalent of a diff patch.

Creating the DDT patches could be fun.  I got to create one for
DBMS-20 as my first task (after finding the bug of course) at
DEC.  It seems like it took as long to create the patch so it
would past muster as it did to find the problem after resurrecting
the sources and test system.  A couple of tests needed to be
reversed so fixing the source was easy.  The patch was another
matter :-)

Yep, the AN monitor was a separate build, and a different monitor.
Also, I think older monitors (e.g. V5 and older) didn't have NIA20
support, only IMP support.  I don't think you are likely to find many
IMPs (or TIPs) these days.

TOPS-20 version 4 wants an IMP for the network connection.  You need
version 6 of TOPS-20 which has Ethernet support.  He emulates 
the NIA20, not an IMP.

Right, kind of puts the kibosh on that idea.  Really, for TOPS-20 anyway,
the thing to do is to get the ARPAnet monitor that used the NI.  Or, as
somebody else suggested, and which would work for any version of TOPS-20,
TOPS-10, TENEX, etc, would be a special Telnet server that ran a copy of
the PDP-10 emulator underneath itself, through a PTY, in such a way that
the OS is already running and the telnet client gets the login prompt
(i.e. does not have to sysgen and boot the OS, etc, before logging in).

I tend to think this would be a "trivial" change to the telnet server,
which would then be assigned to a special high-numbered port.  The hard
part, I think, would be finding a way to start the PDP-10 emulator in
user mode at its login prompt.

Exactly. 

However, I would change the console stuff a little bit too - dump output
to syslog, get input/output by telnetting to another port. The goal
would be to get the emulator running totally in the background.

Having control of what a DZ11 "is" has it's advantages:

- Start Kermit under TOPS-10, connect to a "TTY" on the "DZ11" and you
  get a UNIX prompt. Or, a kermit session in SERVER mode which would let
  you do FTP-type things. Or just a plain outbound telnet session to 
  wherever you want.

- Going the other way, you could use ANOTHER port and give the incoming
  connection a Kermit session in server mode. Again, FTP-type things.
  Plus, the advantage that you could do this from a remote machine on
  the Internet. Shameless Kermit plug :)

Isn't it fun deciding what to do with software that's 20 years old,
running on an emulator that isn't even released yet?

I hope the GCC port happens... that would help getting a newer
version of Kermit running. Frank, care to do the port of C-Kermit
to the PDP-10?

Kermit is a regular user program like TECO, that reads and writes the
job's controlling TTY, but unlike TECO.  But rather than reading
editing commands and printing their results, Kermit is reading and
writing file-transfer protocol packets.

Meanwhile, you are accessing the PDP-10 (or emulator) from (say) a
VT100 emulator on a PC.  When you want to transfer a file from the PC
to the PDP-10, you start Kermit on the 10, tell it to receive,
"escape back" to the PC (e.g. by typing Alt-x), and tell it to send the
file.  And vice versa in the other direction.

I think we're complicating matters unnecessarily (and perhaps fatally)
by postulating yet another outboard processor for networking.  Maybe
I'm not understanding something, but it seems awfully complicated to
require the PC to simultaneously emulate two or three different
computers of different architectures, plus the varied and sundry
connections and protocols between them ("ring the doorbell", etc),
than to emulate just one computer, especially on a general-purpose
timesharing system like UNIX, where process scheduling might get in
the way of the timing constraints in those protocols.

Implementing ARPAnet protocols for the entire PDP-10 line would be a
big job, since there were so many ways to do it -- outboard
processors, host-to-IMP protocols, host-to-ANF10 protocols, etc etc.
TOPS-20 v6 and later could do it all internally, which is much
simpler.  But as I recall, in all cases the ARPAnet monitor was a
"layered product", not part of the base system.

I think the choice of KS10 for the first emulation was wise because
it minimizes the multiple emulations problem -- I don't recall for
sure, but I don't think the KS10 had a PDP-11 front end for terminals...
But the KL sure did.  And then think of ITS with its SUPDUP front
ends, and the crazy setup they had at CMU, with a hierarchical
network of PDP-11s all over campus running a home-grown OS (as I
recall) that multiplexed and compressed terminal sessions.

A serial-port-driver to Telnet interface, however, gets bare-bones
Internet connectivity for all of these at once (I think).  Maybe it
won't let you make, e.g., Telnet or FTP connections OUT OF the 10, but
you can make Telnet connections INTO the 10, and you can transfer
files into and out of the 10 over these connections.  Later, if
somebody finds a way to implement ARPAnet protocols for some
particular combination of OS version and outboard processor, then you
get all the rest -- FTP, Telnet, Finger, etc, initiated FROM the 10,
plus email, bboard, etc.

Actually, the serial-port/telnet emulator *could* let you make
connections out of the 10 with Kermit, if it came with a Telnet client
as well as a server, since Kermit-10 and Kermit-20 both let you dial
out from a serial port.

There's a lot more difference than "paddle cards".  There's a set of
boards that installs in the place of an RH20, and also requires a few
backplane changes.

Those boards attach by a cable to the box that has the CI20 guts;
that box may be the same as the CI780 box.  But the interface boards
are *much* different.

The NIA20 (AKA NI20) uses the same interface boards as a CI20 attached
to a different box.  I think some of the boards in the box are even the
same, but I don't have detailed hardware docs or prints.
