I cannot take credit for backup10, as I am not the original author.
However I am to blame for Phil's version of backup10, in particular
improving the output, to better resemble that of the original program
(lots of good stuff in those header fields), adding options for the
directory structure of the extracted files, and for attempting to add
options to extract files as raw bits from the tape.

I'm also guilty for attempting to add TPC support.  I'd be happy to
accept changes, fixes, improvements.  I'd also enjoy it if one day
someone sends me private e-mail before shooting off their mouths in
public about how my (admittedly little) attempt to do something useful
and share it IN SOURCE FORM, with EVERYBODY, is a load of crap and
needs to be thrown out.
