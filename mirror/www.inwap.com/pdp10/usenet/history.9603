Ric, how could you forget the good old 680/I, which was interfaced
to the -10 via a DC-68 interface thru the I/O bus and could support
100 lines? Was designed to be a lower cost to the original /RCC
designed DC-10, which could support up to 64 hardwired or dataset lines.
The 680/I had a PDP-8/I which ran around and assembled the bits for
all the lines (scanned them); the DC-10 was called the data line scanner
because that's what it did. Thus, the module SCNSER's name . . .

Maybe there are some crossed wires here.  The KL10 and KS10 were the only
-10s that REQUIRED a little front-end computer to provide console services.
But KIs often used front-end PDP-11s called DN87 to provide terminal lines
and other remote services.  *I* call these systems "front-ends" too.
An earlier version of the front-end, called the DN92, I think, was based on
a PDP-8.  Earlier -10s used a hardwired device called a DC10 to provide
the terminal connectivity.

I'm not sure which ones of these could have been used by a KA10.

Much as I hate to disagree with Ric, there were PDP-8 terminal interfaces.
They had a number of advantages over the DC-10, if you were willing to do
some -truly- -incredibly- twisty real-time PDP-8 assembly programming.

They emulated UARTs in SOFTWARE?!?!  They could auto-baud-detect and change
line speed; they could deal with BREAK.  They were the only things around
which -could- do that on a -10 at the time (1970).  (At least that anyone
could afford).

At ISC in Braintree, we finally retired the last one about 1978-9.

Well, as I recall it, the DC72 was a PDP-8 based "remote controller,"
and you tied terminals off it. You could tie as many terminals as the
PDP-8 bus could handle (within the limits of the 9.6 Kb line that
drove the typical DC72, although some had higher speed lines, mostly
in the military).

The DC72 was a real kludge, and didn't speak DECNET, but a precursor
protocol (sort of). Even the DN8x DECNET wasn't PDP-11 DECNET, just to
make compatibility expensive, but what the DC72 spoke was even less
so.

The DC72 could be, but rarely was, direct connected to a -10, which
still used the synchronous protocol manager to drive it. There was
also a precursor to the DC72, of uncertain nomenclature, which was
PDP-8 based.

Your memory is about right on the DN8x series, roughly. I think the
DN87 was the box that connected to the -10 through a memory channel,
and there were DN82's, which were terminal concentrators and DN85's,
which were terminal concentrators with line printers or some such.
The DN8x series were all based on PDP-11 machines.

There was also a DN72, which was a real dog -- DC72 hardware but with
new drivers. I think we got one to handle 8 terminals once...

Wasn't the DC76 also based on a PDP-11?

And don't forget the DN92, also a PDP-8.  (Not really a terminal FE; it was an
RJE station, though I think maybe you could put a few terminals on it too.)

I don't recall the DN8x async. FEs, but we had lots of fun here with a pair of
DN20s running DN87S.

BillW is correct.  A fair number of KA-10 and KI-10 systems WERE front-ended
by PDP-8s.  (In this context, "front end" means "the device that you connect
all your async terminals to" and not "the thing that loads microcode".)

SCNSER had support for <DATAI DLS,AC> to read from the DC10 Data Line Scanner
and from PDP-8 based devices on the CCI (Computer to Computer Interface,
I/O device 14).

At the Colorado School of Mines, we had a PDP-8 serving all the ASR-33 TTY
lines.  We had things set up such that the PDP-10 could boot from the PDP-8.

Well, almost.  The usual way of booting a KA was to boot from paper tape,
using a short program in the paper tape reader that would read a larger
BOOTS program off the first few blocks of the RP02.  The pre-boot program
wasn't very big, an we were able to store it in an unused section of the
PDP-8's memory.  If you set the Read-In Mode switches to 014 (CCI) instead
of 104 (PTR), the short boot program would be entered into the PDP-10's
memory from the 8 instead of from paper tape.

I'm trying to remember the name of the company that made our PDP-8 base
async terminal front-end.  I think it was Digital Communications
Associates of Alpharetta, Georgia.  (I think they made IRMA boards and
stat muxes as well.)  Who else had PDP-8's driving 110 and 300 baud TTYs?

Nah.  Has nothing to do with emulators or bit-banging UARTs.

But I will point out that the 680 and 680i boxes DID have some hardware
help in assembling/disassembling characters.  They did operate
on the characters one bit at a time, but there was a special
line card to interface to the outside world and to hold the bit as it
came in/went out.  And a special form of the rotate instruction
which built up the incoming character.  Different baud rates were supported
by having different clock interrupts to scan the lines at a particular
rate.  Mostly 110 and 300 baud.

So it was mostly, but not completely, software.  I had to do the
driver code in TOPS-6 or TOPS-10 (Can't remember which after all these
years) and made some changes in the PDP-8 code to make life easier
on the 36-bit side.

During my KA days at WMU, we had hard-wired TTYs to the -10 and all the
dial-ins were connected via the 680/I.

Then I seem to remember that DEC started developing software for the DC72
when we were in Marlboro; so that was just before the KL came out. Then
came the DC76 which worked much better.

The DN8x, etc.  really came out of the software developed by the DAS
group. For instance, the DN87 was really the hardware of the DC76 running
DAS software. It seems to me we called that protocol ANF10; and I don't
believe it had any relationship to DECnet with the exception that we
(TOPS10) were doing networks while DECnet was still a gleam in someone's
eye (smiley face here).

   In the configurations of PDP-10s I worked on, we were able to boot right
from the disk drives (RP-04s or RP-06s connected via an RH-10/DF-10 pair).

   We simply set the readin address switches to 220 (I believe, it's been
a _long_ time), zapped memory (real easy on a KI), and pegged the READIN
button. Worked like a champ.

   In fact, we got so sick of the length of time BOOTS took to BLT itself into
high memory, one of out hotshots wrote a fast boot program known as QBOOT as
a replacement for BOOTS; it better than quartered the delay from punching
READIN to operational status. (The slave CPUs were even easier; start @400).

/rcc himself has given you the best reference you could ask for: from the
actual developer himself. He might even remember the names of some of
the engineers that also worked on the DC68-680/I.

I can attest personally that in 1970, I used a 680/I at school, and I
even read the PDP-8 code listings. /rcc reminded us of the special instruction
they added. I seem to recall something about shifting the bits through
the "link bit", but that's a very hazy memory.

Sorry for the fizzled original of this post; I think the newsreader died
when I edited its configuration file and didn't bother to restart it . . .

As far as front-end processors go, they can be divided into two
classifications:

1) Console Front Ends - The processor responsible for initializing, monitoring, 
   and diagnosing the 36 bit ISP. In this category there are two.

   The PDP-6, KA10, and KI10 had no CFE. They had lots of switches and lights
   (wonderful lights!!!).

   The KL10 had a PDP-11/40 running RSX20F as the CFE. In addition to the basic
   responsibilities listed above, the CFE also supported up to 128 TTYs, CDR,
   LPTs, the CTY, and a KLINIK line (for dial in diagnosis).

   The KS10, as mentioned above, had an Intel 8080 acting as the CFE. This CFE
   was a much simpler design and handled only the CTY and KLINIK lines.

2) Communications Front Ends - Processors responsible for providing
   communications services to the host. There were a number of different design
   centers and protocols supported.

Minicomputer Terminal Controllers:

680 - A PDP-8 managing TTYs.

680i - A PDP-8/I managing TTYs.

DC76 - A PDP-11/40 managing up to 128 TTYs. DC76 code base. Attached via DL10.


ANF10 Network Processors:

Host attached front ends:

DC75 - A PDP-11/15 managing a number of DS11 sync lines. DN8x code base.
       Attached to host via DL10.

DN87 - A PDP-11/40 managing TTYs and synch lines. DN8x code base Attached via
       DL10.

DN87s - Same as the DN87 except that it attached via DTE (KL10 only).

DN20 - A PDP-11/34 managing TTYs and synch lines. DN8x code base Attached via
       DTE (KL10 only).

Network attached nodes:

DC71 - PDP-8/I based remote station. 16 TTYs, CDR, LPT, and CTY. 1 synch line.
       ANF10 End Node. (Note. There was an earlier code base that used a 
       bisynch-ish protocol to talk to the host. Pre-ANF10.)

DC72 - PDP-8/E based remote station. 16 TTYs, CDR, LPT, and CTY. 1 synch line.
       ANF10 End Node.

DN92 - PDP-8/A based remote station. Updated DC72.

DN82 - PDP-11/40 based remote station. DN8x code base. 32 TTYs, CDR, LPT, CTY,
       and synch lines. Full ANF routing node.

DN200 - PDP-11/34 based remote station. Updated DN82.


DECnet Network Processors:

Host attached front ends:

DN20 - A PDP-11/34 managing DECnet synch lines.

Network attached nodes:

DN200 - PDP-11/34 based remote station. Supported TTYs, CDR, and LPT in a
        DECnet network.


IBM Communications Processors:

DN61 - PDP-11/40 supporting Bisynch communications for TOPS10. Supported
       2780/3780 RJE stations or emulated 2780/3780 RJE stations. DL10 attached.

DN61s - A DTE attached DN61. (KL10 Only)

DN62 - Same as DN61 with HASP support.

DN62s - A DTE attached DN61. (KL10 Only)

DN64 - PDP-11/34 supporting Bisynch communications for TOPS20. Supported
       2780/3780 RJE stations or emulated 2780/3780 RJE stations. DTE Attached.

DN65 - Same as DN64 with HASP support.


While I suppose that one could argue that the BBN IMP was a front end, it
wasn't a DEC product. It had a Honeywell mini in it and connected to the 36 bit
host via an AN10 or an AN11 (KS10).

There were also some of third party front ends. The Smart8/E from Digital
Communications Associates comes to mind.

I think that this covers most of the significant front end processors in the
36 bit family.

Perhaps if I tell a broken version of the story, probably heard at least 
second or third hand, /rcc will grace us with the original story.

The story goes as such: a woman named Irma kept complaining to DEC that her
terminal would hang up while she was reading in a paper tape (she was using
either a model 33 or 35, with the paper tape reading option). 

Eventually her complaints reached the monitor guys. Presumably, /rcc got 
involved and talked to the infamous Irma himself. At first he didn't believe
that is wasn't just something that she was doing wrong somewhere, or that
her paper tape reader was screwy. Eventually, the legend goes, /rcc went to
see the problem for himself, and voila: her terminal really was hanging 
periodically! 

The problem was that her terminal interface was occasionally dropping transmit
done interrupts, and without said interrupt, there was nothing to trigger the
output of the next character, so the line hung forever.

The solution: /rcc installed the famous "IRMA CATCHER", LDB bit LPLIRM in 
LDBPAG (I think it was somewhere else originally, but that's where it lives
today in 7.05 SCNSER) which is set on an active line if no interrupt is seen
within a second. The next time around, if a transmit done interrupt still 
hasn't occurred on the line, the next character is forced out regardless.
Thus, the once-a-second character output that some of us have seen now and 
then.

Someone ought to see if good old Irma is still around and where she is working 
 . .

/evs

p.s. Again, I'll be happy to have the story from /rcc, and I'm sure my version
has some mistakes. I heard my version originally from Don Lewine, who 
frequents this newsgroup now and then. He probably got the story from /rcc
or someone who worked with /rcc in DEC10 LCGE . . .

Well, we certainly had networking on the -10s before DECnet, but not all 
that far in advance.  What we really had far in advance was the idea of 
handling terminal traffic outside of the main processor's box.  That was 
the beginning of ANF10, the work that the old DAS group did.  That was 
the DC7x series:  DC72 was the remote (over a sync line) concentrator, 
which connected (initially) to the DS10 I/O Bus box on the -10; the DC76, 
which was the local (next to the -10) terminal line concentrator, which 
connected to the DL10 (and before that the short lived DMA10); and 
finally the box that started getting us into the "true" WAN oriented 
networking, the DC75.  The DC75 was designed to interface to the -10 via 
the DL10, and take over the sync line handling functions of the DS10 
without the I/O Bus overhead of the DS10.  Then you could put remote DC72 
and (anyone remember these) DC68 (PDP8 based remote line concentrators) 
boxes in the field, and terminate them in the DC75.  Actually, you could 
daisy chain then one level deep in some configurations, so a line (which 
were real expensive then) could run from the DC75 to a DC72, and then to 
another DC72 or DC68.

Then came the DN8x series, which brought ANF10 (using the NSP protocol) 
and real networks.  The DC7x series really were terminal (and some unit 
record device) oriented.  The DN8x series understood the concepts of 
routing, load balancing over the WAN, and  the truely advanced concept of 
buffering characters from multiple terminals (a la LAT) and sending the 
whole sheebang to the -10 in one message.  The DC7x series sent one 
character at a time.  The DN8x also understood errors, error handling, 
and recovery (what, you mean those telco lines sometimes dropped a few 
bits?!)

THE DL10, by the way, has always been in my book the most interesting 
device ever put on the -10s.  Here we have a box the size of an 
industrial refrigerator, built mostly from off the stockroom shelf 
boards.  One one side you have 1-4 UNIBUSs and off the other 1-2 DEC10 
memory bus/IO Bus connections.  In the middle you have one heck of a 
memory map.  We actually booted the PDP11s by running a prog on the -10 
which simply loaded itself into the memory, mapped (yea, mapped, before 
KL10 days) the DL10 -10 side addresses into it's space (after locking 
it's memory down), shoving the -11 sides version of that base address 
into a register the -11 could see, then hitting the doorbell for the 
-11.  The -11 would start running, but all of it's code was in the -10's 
memory.  For it's time, that was pretty advanced.  The best part of the 
DL10 though was when the -11 had any problems and the local office sent 
out an -11 tech to handle it.  First rule of -11 debugging is to follow 
the UNIBUS, so he'd try to do so.  But the last thing in the -11 was the 
cable going to the DL10, which of course is physically bigger than 
anything an -11 tech has every seen in his life!  He'd follow that cable, 
it'd go into this box, so he'd start over.  After a few times of doing 
these, he'd open this box that was a mystery to him, and get such an odd 
look on his face:  it was filled with boards he knew, but had never seen 
so many in one place at one in a box with power applied to it.

THen came the DTE20, and all the fun went out of life.  I peg the DTE20 
and the RH20 as the beginning of a new generation where technology 
started getting out of hand, and took on a life of it's own, commonly 
referred to as "microcode!"

Once DECnet came out, and looked like it might work (aka DECnet Phase 
II), it even started to have some of the capabilities of ANF10!  Once 
DECnet got to Phase III, it had mode of ANF10s primary capabilities.  
Sometime in the Phase II life of DECnet, we decided that maybe it ws a 
good idea to communicate and interoperate (this was before the word 
"open" had been discovered), and so the DCP ( DECnet Compatible Port) was 
born.  Kalman Reti and Wayne (WEM) Matson spent a lot of time on that.  
It ended up doing a pretty decent job of fooling the rest of the DN87 (it 
was code that ran in the DN87) into thinking that the DECnet network was 
just another ANF10 node.  Itlucked out because Phase II didn't know about 
routing, although ANF10 did, so it didn't have to do that bit of 
trickery.  The luck only lasted a while though, because I ended up 
spending a lot of time on a second round of work at Ft. Huachuca getting 
it to talk to their Phase III VAX system.

The DC20 series came into play, which brought us some new devices like 
the DZ11, which were actually stupider than the old ones (DH11, which was 
a *really* smart terminal line interface; I don't think any OS from DEC 
ever used it's true capabilities).  It also brought a constant yearning 
on the part of the customer base for us to make use of the 11/34s ability 
to have a lot more memory than the 11/40 - it had memory mapping even!

Best story I ever heard on ANF10s capabilites and where it stood 
architecturaally in the industry came from Bob Harper, who I worked with 
in Arizona, and who left DEC to go to Honeywell in Phoenix.  Some of 
their deep thinkers decided that they needed to get into networking, and 
so started thinking deep and hard, and came up with a good design.  They 
got everyone together to review it, and everyone thinks it is great.  
Capabilities like remote terminal concentration, WANs with multiple 
paths, virtual terminals between hosts (SET HOST), remote printers, etc 
etc. etc.  Well, Bob raises his hand and says to the effect "uh (first 
word in all Bob Harper sentences), this looks real good, but I gotta tell 
y'all that Digital already does that."  The response from aforementioned 
thinkers of the deep was "impossible; it hasn't been discovered yet!"  
"Discovered," like something under a rock!  So Bob decides to prove his 
point.  Remember how we used to have a PPN for the field to log into 
1026, using the "*" capability to have a PPN assigned during that session 
only?  Well Bob decides to dial in and use it (naw, "breaking and 
entering" refers to your house not your computer!) to show these guys.  
Next thing they know he is SET HOSTing from  Galway to Phoenix to 
Marlboro to got knows where, doing SYSTATs (since you didn't have to 
LOGIN to run SYSTAT on a remote system that you didn't have an account on).
He said that the looks on the faces of the thinkers deep was a cross 
between mystification/dread/mortification and just in general and on SH*T 
type of feeling.

This was the same era that produced the new Digital slogan"

Digital, making tomorrow yesterday today"

Plus it understood how to do local echoing (can you say
"echo pipeline marker"?), something which LAT terminal servers
never did.

Oh, and that's "DN20", not "DC20".

Another thing I remeber about ANF10 was its routing method.
I still remeber going to a talk with Bob Houk (Mr. ANF10
during my stint in TOPS-10 engineering).  We went to listen
to Radia Perlman talk about a revolutionary new routing
algorithm they were going to use in DECnet PhaseV, called
"Link State Routing".  Supposedly a great advance over the
limitations of Phase IV routing.  Bob heard a little of the
talk and realized that the "new" method Radia described was
the same one that ANF10 had been using for years.  No credit
to the -10 group for developing it though.

I once heard that the DL10 was more complicated to repair
than the KI-10 to which it was attached.  Luckily ours
at UW never broke!

DN87 was the box that spoke IBM BiSync RJE protocol.  Loads of fun.  I thought
that the hardware itself was called DN20.  (At least, when we didn't need both
our DN87s anymore, and we did need DECnet, I was able to pour routing software
for the DN20 into the box and make it run.)  It did indeed run across, was that
the DTE?  I spent a lot of interesting hours trying to understand the code on
both the PDP11 and PDP10 sides, and make it work a little more the way we liked
it.  (*Not* the DTE protocol code -- I left that strictly alone.)

Memories!  I remember a subsystem called DAS78, and I think that eventually
that found its way into the regular product line as DN87S.  We also had a
hacked version ("DAS79") that would talk another RJE protocol (Export/Import)
to CDC Kronos systems.  I inherited the maintenance on all of this stuff at our
site, some years ago.  Fun, fun, fun!  (I am only being half-sarcastic here.)

I just came across a sheaf of Special Product Bulletins from ASG that encompass
a lot of DN7x, DN8x gear.

Dunno about your FE, but we still have the remains of a statewide network of
DCA 300-series terminal switches, and some of their DPAX stat muxes.  It was
said that DCA was started by people who had left Digital.  (The 300s boot from
DECtape II drives, though floppy drives were also offered later.)  They later
bought the IRMA line from someone and IMHO kinda forgot about the switch
business.

I dunno about "grace".  (And, please, it's spelled "/Rcc" even though
the early TTYs and LPTs were monocase.)  Well.  These legends fade a
bit with time, but I'll try...

True. (Although she herself was too quiet to have been the one
complaining.)  She worked for one of the PDP-10-based time sharing
services in the southwest.  My memory is vague here, I think it was in
Albuquerque, but it might have been SLC or some other place.

True.

False.  Although it sure seemed like a hardware problem, it was software.

Actually, that was a side effect, which I put in while chasing the
real bug, and which I decided to leave in as a belt-and-suspenders thing.

The real problem was very boring and simple, though it took me forever
to find it.   There were interrupt-level bits and process-level
bits in the status word for the TTY (DEVIOUS xxx DEVIOS(DEVDAT)).

I hadn't wanted to add a whole extra word per terminal (small memories
in those days, plus it would have messed up the way DDBs were
allocated and initialized) just for a bit or two for interrupt level.

I was real careful about protecting things from interrupt level in all
my code.  Eventually I discovered to my horror that SETIOD, way over
in the generic file system code, was setting the file-buffer-level IO
DONE bit not by

	movx T1,IODONE
	IORM T1,DEVIOS(DEVDAT)

which would have been safe, but by something like

	move t1,DEVIOS(DEVDAT)
	fiddle-dee-dee for a while
	txo t1,IODONE
	movem T1,DEVIOS(DEVDAT)

and that of course trashed the TX_PENDING bit when an interrupt happened
in between there.  And SETIOD was so many levels away from the code I
was staring at that I didn't verify that it was OK, and I couldn't believe
it would have been written that way anyhow.

Why it happened so repeatably to that one user on that one machine, and
ran just fine on the machines at the mill, I'll never know.


>Someone ought to see if good old Irma is still around and where she is working

She seemed like a nice quiet person who just stoically put up with what the
computer kept doing to her.  Dunno if she was ever aware that her name
was immortalized in the monitor sources.  I sure felt badly about it
when I kept saying "Now I've got it nailed!  This time, for sure!" and
she would sit down at her trusty TTY and have it hang again within
five minutes.

Well, given that the NI20 was how KLs connected to Ethernets, I'd guess
that a lot of them were sold (relative to the number of KLs sold.)  DECnet
and LAT also ran over the NI20.

The NI20 took up two RH slots which doesn't match your mention of a BA box.
There was the AN10/20 which connected a KL to an IMP.  Perhaps that is
what you were thinking of?

The NI was Digital's eventual method of putting a KL on an Ethernet, but it
only came out around 1987 or so.  Long before that, there were devices such as
the Stanford (later cisco Systems) MEIS (MASSBUS-Ethernet Interface Subsystem),
which made the Ethernet look logically like a tape drive.  Much nicer than the
NI, as it could do things like talk to itself on the net (useful for testing).

The NI had to be placed at RH #5 (just as the CI had to be placed at #7).  The
main hardware for the two was identical; they just had different microcode and
network interfaces.

Ahem....  The NI came out around 84 or 85.

The NI supported a loopback mode, but since the hardware that calculated the
CRC could only be connected to either the transmit or the receive side, you
would always get a CRC error if you received any of your own transmissions.

I *believe* that the MEIS also had this aspect.  Therefore if it was looping
anything, it was either just doing it internally, or ignoring the CRC errors
that resulted from the transmission.

You are both sort of right.  The NI and CI both consisted of two sets of
boards.  One set, which was common to both lived in the MBOX, the other set,
which was specific to the NI or the CI lived in an outboard box, usually housed
in a BA cabinet.  The common boards were called a KLIPAs, and consisted of 2901
based systems with 2910 controllers.  These boards (I think there were three)
were installed in the MBOX in the same slots that were used for RH20s.  Each
KLIPA really only occupied one RH (actually, CBUS) slot.  The reason DEC used
two slots was because the power requirements of KLIPAs were higher than RH20s.

The other set of boards were specific to the NI and CI.  The NI had a single
board, which was basically just a big buffer and a transceiver interface.  The
ethernet controller (so to speak) was just a bunch of PALs which left all of
the hard stuff (like retransmissions and address filtering) to the KLIPA.  The
CI consisted of three boards, and had considerable smarts.

These boards lived in their own seperate card cage, which was housed in a BA
box.  I think that it was also possible to put the card cage in the same box
that housed th MF20 if room was available.

Hello Stu -

The SEEQ ethernet chip used by the MEIS has CRC hardware for both
the transmit and receive sides.  So, yes, the MEIS could receive
its own full-length transmissions, including the correct CRC.
This made debugging easier and in the field you could easily tell
if you are really connected to the Ethernet.  We liked the idea so
much that the MCI, MEC, and FEP Ethernet cards for high end cisco
routers have the same design.

As for looking like a tape drive, well, that's a slight
exaggeration.  The MEIS was of course a Massbus device with its
own RH20 driver.  There was a path in the code where the MEIS was
busy and you didn't want any new I/O started just then.  Len
Bosack appropriated a status bit used by rewinding tape drives to
defer I/O.  It was rather cute: "sorry, no new I/O just now, we're
rewinding the Ethernet".

I think two points of history might be interesting here. First TOPS-20 
itself had a NIH problem and was the prime competitor to what became VMS. 
(TOPS-10 was never in the running for some reason and the KS-10 was one 
result) There was a point around 1977 where a 36 bit system running an 
evolved TOPS-20 was a very serious competitor to what became VAX and VMS.
One of the ways that VAX/VMS won the fight was to discredit as much as possible 
about KL-10/TOPS-20. {Interestingly enough one of the problems was the 
ability to run in a 32K system).

One of the problems the KL-10 had was a paper written at (I seem to 
recall) MIT claiming that the tradeoffs between Hardwired logic and 
Microcoded logic were "all wrong". The issue was around the paging 
hardware and microcode. I recently noticed that ALPHA has made the same 
tradeoffs that the KL-10 made in this area.

On a related note (sort of) one of the high priority requirements for VMS 
was that it be able to GUARANTEE deterministic respone times to timed 
events and certain interupts. This had it's ancestory in a project at 
some university to play music. Apparently under TOPS-x0 (don't recall if 
it was -10 or -20) in a timesharing environment it was not possible to 
make the music play properly. Does anyone out there remember more details 
on this?

That's curious, because for many years the leading centers for computer
music in the world, CCRMA (Stanford University) and IRCAM (Paris, France)
used heavily-modified versions of TOPS-10.

Yeah--by the original developers.  The reason Unix was written for the PDP-7
was that they couldn't get funding for a -10 purchase...

Hi everyone,

Just got back from trudging the Fall DECUS '95 trade show, where XKL and I
showed off the first public exhibition of TOPS-10 running on a TOAD.
(Yes, you could even type "MAKE LOVE" at it and it would give the appropriate
response).

Here, for your amusement, I will recount a little story I told a few newbie
DEC employees (oh, I'm sorry, am I supposed to say "Digital"?)  . . .

There are 3 major versions of DEC: DEC 1.0, DEC 2.0, and DEC 3.0.

DEC V1.0 (1958-1975): Hi, were Digital Equipment corporation. Here are some 
nifty computers to help you get some work done. Feel free to hook them up to
anything you want, here's all the code, have fun! If you have any trouble,
we're here to help.

DEC V2.0 (1976-1992 or so): Hi, we're Digital, you're not. Here are our
computers. Buy them or else. What, you say you're having trouble getting
your work done on them? Too bad, change the way you work to fit how our
computers work. What, you want to hook up non-Digital things to it? WE'LL
SUE!! Whose computer do you think it is, anyway?

DEC V3.0: (1992- ): We're sorry, we won't do it again . . .

I graduated in JUN68 with BSEE and joined PDP-10 Engineering
(rather than being one of 300 engineers designing the IBM
System/360 Model 195 which was my only other computer
offer).

There were two major transitions going on then:
* Digital was growing from small to large
* The industry was going from discrete components to ICs

I was the 11th engineer in PDP-10 Engineering--each was
given lots of responsibility. My first assignment was as
Project Engineer of the RP10--a PDP-10 disk controller for
RP-02 (Digital's name for OEMed Memorex 660--IBM 2314 type)
25 MB disks. The RP10 listed for $29K, the RP-02 for $25K.
They ended up selling 300 RP10s and 1500 RP-02s for a list
of $8.7M of controllers + $37.5M of disks which I felt was
quite a bit of responsibility when June grads were making
$6,800 to $8,600 (actual numbers from my school's placement
office for jobs accepted in JUN68).

The next Spring I saw a job posting. The PDP-11 product line
(no product had yet been announced) was looking for a JUN69
graduate to design a disk controller to the same RP-02. Only
the candidate was to be a Junior Engineer understudying a
Senior Engineer for his first project. Digital had made the
transition from small to large. New hire June grads were in
training for the first year.

All my Senior labs were with ICs. When I started at Digital
I asked for an approved parts list. My manager said, "We
don't use ICs. The last time we evaluated them they didn't
have enough noise rejection." (Of course not if you take
every pin of every chip and bring it out to a Gardner-Denver
wirewrap backplane 15.5 inches wide and 21.0 inches high or
bigger!) As a result the RP-10 was 6' high, 19" wide, had
144 lights, and almost 500 discrete component circuit cards!

Anyway I'm only 49yo, but I designed a major piece of
digital logic for a major computer vendor with discrete
components.

Back in '69 when the RP10 and RP-02 first shipped the disk
was $25K/25MB or $1000./MB. A recent Fry's ad in the San
Jose Mercury offers a Conner IDE hard drive at $249./1.6GB
or $0.156/MB (over 6400 times cheaper)--but that's another
story.

36-bits or none at all! :-)

For those of you who don't know what we're talking about the RP-02
used a linear motor to move the head assembly. There was a rack
machined with teeth spaced 0.02 in. apart. There were two pawls offset
by 0.01 in. arranged such that either one or the other of them would
mesh with a few teeth and hold the head assembly in place. There were
203 cylinders 0.01 in apart. A bank of RP02's up close would make
quite a racket.

I had to test a maximum configuration of 8 for weeks in the mill on
floor 5-0, below milll pond level and untouched by sunlight. But
that's another story.

If memory serves, NCODE & NAG came into exsistance in the 1975-76 school 
year.  They had setup a PDP-11/50 with RSTS-E (still can't get over BASIC 
written in BASIC, and getting system error messages).

Back then (1975 - 1983 [RIP KA-10/50 #103]) System was 64K, 4 RP-02, 
DL10, PDP-8/I (communications).  My memory becomes a little foggy after that.

In 1978-79, in came the KS-10s.  One new machine about every 8 months 
until there was just no more room for the KA.  Thats when LIRICS donated 
the KA to a school for special children, who had alot of fun pulling all 
of that wire from the backplanes.  :( [weep]

No idea.

LIRICS, named by ace secretary Karen Pepe, began as fallout from the 
famous Huntington Project (1968-7?) and began with a PDP-8I, 16K core, 
and a 128K swapping disk - 12 users on genuine 103 Bell Datasets.

In the summer of '71, we got our KA-10, and turned the '8 into a giant 
UART (DCA-680) and initially ran about 72 users, with 2 RP-02s, @128Kw 
core, four TU-56 dectape drives, ptr/ptp. Status symbol was having your 
own dectape that Karen would mount for you if she was in a good mood.

By '72, we were growing, a couple of mux's to central points, some 
schools ordering more than one Teletype ASR-33 and acoustic modem. A 256 
Kw box, DEC's newest design, appeared.

By '77 we had the swapping drum, four RP-02's 1 magtape, communications 
equipment from hell, and a few other cabinet-size boxes filled with 
misc. I/O bus equipment.

In 1980 I stopped by after losing a bid on the `10. I had a beat-up PDP-
9 and was desperate for B-213 modules, the ones both machines were made 
of, and which had an annoying habit of smoking the pull-up resistors no 
matter how many watt carbon resistors you put on the board. I just 
wanted a handful out of the drum controller, but was refused. Suffolk 
County BOCES, the unit that oversaw LIRICS and all county special ed 
services gave the entire computer to a class of mildly retarded children 
to teach them how to desolder. Yep, for real. I fought like hell, but 
couldn't even sneak a module or two off the gutted backplanes.

LIRICS had switched over to four 20XX machines, a number I hear grew 
before someone ousted(?) long-time project operator Gerald Damm and 
decided that Commodore Pets were the classroom computer of the future, 
may the BOCES school board members of the time be wrapped in endless 
lengths of wire-wrap wire.

That KA-10 had much more on it before it died, we had that bastard drum, 
four RP-02s at least one 256Kword core box, four TU-55s, a 7-track(?) 
magtape, etc. The PDP-8/I, son-of-Huntington Project machine was turned 
into the giant UART for the `10, running the DCA-680 communications 
interface.

Pepe, Barry (forgotten last name) as well as any of the other LIRICS 
regulars, please contact me.

Actually, the problem was that the "school for special children" and 
LIRICS were -both- owned by the Board of Cooperative Educational 
Services (BOCES) of Suffolk County, NY, the reason they rejected all the 
bids offered on KA-10 #103.

If the thing had to die, I wouldn't mind the -backplanes- going as much 
as I minded the modules going - (as I said, I had a PDP-9 at the time, 
based on the same B flipchips)

(The bids ran along the lines of OK, I'll take it! as the bidders, high 
school and college students all, were universally poor).

The neatest thing about the RM10B was the conical shape of the rotating
drum.  It spun on a vertical axis, and when the unit was powered down,
the drum would 'fall' downwards after about 25 minutes, thus pulling
the drum away from the heads before a full stop occured.  This action
was purely mechanical, triggered by the drum's speed falling below
a certain rate.

Best part: the action was accompanied by a _loud_ THUNK.  A little

The Bryant Drum was contained within a (Dec) standard 19" rack.

The Burroughs Disk was contained in a blue container which (as I recall) 
was about 4 1/2 or so feet long by about 4 feet high by about 18" thick.

     Joe...Stumbled across your PDP-10 homepage last night, and shed a few 
     tears. I worked at University of Queensland (Australia) when we got 
     our first KA-10 (Serial#s 3 & 4 as I recall - 2 Series Monitor - no 
     swapping - "Core is available but not for you!"). Worked as an 
     operating system programmer maintaining and 'enhancing' 4-series then 
     5-series monitors. I wish you could post the text of some of the SPRs 
     from the old days...they were hilarious...some great flames before 
     flames were so named.
     
     Went to the UK in '76 to work at Time Sharing Limited (PDP-10 based 
     bureau) as Systems Engineering Manager and worked with the Systems 
     Concepts guys on the device drivers for the SA-10. Company was bought 
     by ADP Network Services so moved to the US and worked 'till 1983 on 
     various PDP-10 operating system things. (We modified the KL-10 
     microcode to emulate the Xerox Sigma-7 instruction set so that one of 
     our clients could run programs for which they had lost the sourcecode 
     - and the Sigma-7!)
     
     Got to know Wachs & Flemming well and was saddened to learn of their 
     passing - though Jim had had a close call or two before).

I ended up throwing out all the Software Dispatches just before I left
CSM.  I didn't even save my own SPRs.  I wish I knew what happened to
our microfiche.  I don't know of anyone that still has the Dispatches.

Amongst my personal treasures I still have a copy of the "security" SPR 
collection from the 6.03a-7.01 time frame.  I will try to dig it up and see 
whats funny.

They never did publish the "loading your own sys:pfh.exe" doesn't set
the meddle bit bug :-)

Also sorry to hear about JMF.  Back when 7.02 came out he spent a little
bit of time trying to help me get it to run on the KL10 model A we had.
(KL1059).  Even though 7.02 wasn't officially supported on the model A
he was willing to make some suggestions and listen to the problems that
I was having.  You just don't see that kind of developer commitment these 
days (except in the free OS'es now).  It got so bad that they eventually 
would not allow these guys to attend the Decus symposia! :-)

More likely he's referring to the SC Group SC-40, a PDP-10
clone.

However the SC group is not a startup, it's a 30 year old
small business. Mike Levitt started doing business in
Cambridge MA as Systems Concepts in about '66 and Stewart
Nelson soon joined him. They moved the then 4 man company to
San Francisco CA in '70. They moved to Reno NV in about '91
and renamed the company the SC Group.

One claim to fame was the SA10 [PDP-10 memory and I/O bus to
IBM Selector Channel bus converter] which was installed on at
least 10% of all PDP-10s.

From their Web page:
    The SC-40 is a very high-performance system. Its CPU
    can run at an average rate up to 8 times that of the
    DEC KL10, yet a complete system -- CPU, memory, and
    I/O channels -- fits in a standard 20-inch cabinet.

The Web site has a much longer description.

PDP-10 engineering was in 5-5. Building 5 has a loading dock on 5-4.
Trucks used to bump the building pretty hard. My office was 5-5 Pole
41A almost directly opposite the loading dock. One day I had both my
feet up on the legs of my wheeled chair. When a truck hit the building
moved at least an inch under me.

Anyway before I joined Digital in JUN68 a memo had already been
written saying that all Burroughs Disks should be aligned with the
loading dock to prevent head crashes.

Eventually Digital stopped using the loading dock. This eliminated the
possibility that the 120' x 600' 1905 vintage post and lintel wood
frame and brick construction building would be pushed into the mill
pond.

My memories of the Burroughs disk are as follows:-

At Hatfield Polytechnic, in the UK, an RC10 was delivered with the 
original KA10 and the instructions said that it should be protected and 
mounted facing North-South, or East-West (I wish I could remember 
which!). So, it was stood in the corner of the room, out of line with the 
other cabinets and we guessed that it must have something to do with the 
large, vertical magnetic disk interacting with the Earth's magnetic field 
(!!). A strong fence was built around it. 
Later I heard the story that the development lab in Maynard was on floor 
5 of building 5 and, if you know the layout of the Mill, you will know 
that building 5 was next to a cliff and there was an entrance and loading 
bay from the top of this cliff directly into floor 5. Apparently, a truck 
reversed up to the loading bay and hit the building, causing the wooden 
structure to shake and all the heads on the RC10's in the lab touched the 
disks! From then on all RC10's were oriented so that they were 
perpendicular to the loading bay and these instructions found their way 
to the UK where they were applied to the Hatfield system!

In a similar vein, the instructions that were sent to Hatfield 
Polytechnic for dealing with a system crash at this time (1970) was that 
we should take a dump of memory on a Dectape and leave it on Tony Wach's 
desk....

Is it true that Jim Flemming and Tony Wachs are no longer with us? I 
read, recently, that Peter Conklin has died, and David Stone passed away 
a few years ago. I hope there isn't a curse on Dec-10 people....

By, the way, I am Chris Mitchell and I worked on 10's and 20' in the UK 
and Europe for DEC in the 70's and 80's.

I certainly hope there's no curse on us :->

Of the other few -10 monitor group folks I know or know of...
Ernie Socci is still around (worked in the CMU scheduler)
Don Lewine it too
Bob Clements too
I worked on SCNSER and the IPCF stuff for a few years and put
the ANF-10 software into the monitor. (I also have/had some code in Tenex
(at BBN) and TOPS-20 at DEC)

I find I have some obscure -10 stuff from Ed Services
(A couple of 10 or 20 Monitor internals courses and
a -10 networks course.)
Is there a definitive location that wants to save this stuff?

(I also have the Digital Song book
Featuring such hits as:
I'm a PDP-10 Wizard (tune: Yankee Doodle Dandy)
Crash's song (for Donaleen)

Bad idea.  The Computer Museum has buried any interesting (read "36-bit")
hardware.  They were given, for example, the Stanford Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory PDP-6 in 1984, after it was shown at the Fall DECUS Symposia (for
the 20th Anniversary of 36-Bit Computing).

It has never been made available for public view; as far as anyone can tell, it
has disappeared from the face of the earth.

So even if they expressed interest, I'd be highly dubious about the chances of
anything like this surviving very long at the Computer Museum.

Yup Barb, I remember all of them. Reminds me of a story. Jim and I (along 
with Kerry Bensman) were working on a thing called the Real-Time Monitor back 
in 1969 (I think). There was a recession on and DEC had just gone a full 
quarter without delivering a single PDP-10. We got a contract to build a 
special configuration for ORELA (Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator?), and 
Jim got pulled to work on that project. At that time LOADER was the only way 
to link the monitor, but it required more total core than it took to just run 
the system; so DEC had loaned additional boxes of core to several sites so 
they could maintain their systems. Remember, this was before virtual memory. 
Someone figured we could pick up some revenue by providing a way to load the 
monitor without the additional memory. If we got around this problem we could 
ask those sites to give back the loaner memory; the assumption being that 
rather than give it up they would pay for it. So I got pulled from the 
Real-Time Monitor project to make LOADER work with less core. I turned LOADER 
into a kludge called MONLOD, which built the load image on disk instead of in

several hundred thousand dollars in incremental revenue at a time it was

In going through my archives, I found the course materials from my 
original PDP-10 monitor and engineering course in 1970. It includes the 
Program Logic Manual, which is a compilation of the 'Ten Time-Sharing 
Internal Memoranda' issued in 1969, complete with hand-drawn logic 
flow-charts drawn with a warped template. It also has a copy of Tom 
Hastings' MONITOR.OPR (Monitor Assembly & Load Instructions)dated 9 JAN 
1970, still with my incredulous annotations.

The purple ink from the spirit copier they were produced on is fading 
fast. I may need to store them in nitrogen? Perhaps in the Library of 
Congress?

I'm hazy on dates, but if the 6 in question was donated before the museum's
move from MR2 to Boston, you ain't likely to see it in one piece ever again.
They had a garage sale of unwanted items in the MR1 cafeteria one Saturday
before the move, and were selling a PDP-6 module-by-module.  An S6205K
"Arithmetic Registers" module (1-bit slice of AR/MQ/MB/<light buffer>) went
for $7, autographed by Gordon Bell.

I asked him whether read-in mode was implemented as a diode array encoding
instructions.  He said no, and kindly recommended the 6205 as a particularly
central module to have, instead.

It was indeed rare:  Only 23 were ever produced before KO shut down the product
line.  As far as I know, the Stanford AI Lab -6 was the only one still around
in 1984...

ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH!  They killed our 6!!!!

That PDP-6 was in production use at Stanford up until 1980.  To the best
of my knowledge it was the last functioning PDP-6 in the world.  It was
the third CPU in a tri-processor KL/KA/PDP-6 system.  The main function of
the PDP-6 system was to control the DACs and Samson synthesizer for the
Music group.  It had this huge memory box for its 64K of memory.  I
remember that its OS was called Mule.

When SAIL moved from the DC Power building to Margaret Jacks Hall, the
Music group and the PDP-6 stayed.  However, the PDP-6 was retired and they
bought a Foonly to control the stuff.  It languished there until 1984,
when it was donated to the Computer Museum during the DECUS 20th
Anniversary ceremony.  I remember that one of its register bits was stuck,
but the hackers present were able to concoct a neat light show program
that worked around the stuck bit.

It is a terrible, horrible tragedy to hear that DEC's infamous hatred of
the PDP-6 (reportedly, when a PDP-6 was traded in for a KA, field service
would crack the PDP-6's backplane to make sure it was never used again)
came to the extent of destroying the final instance of one, and a museum
piece at that.

The 6205 board is a historic (hysteric?) board, and very nicely represents
the PDP-6.  It's even more bizarre than the KA's B138 module.  Bell wrote
that the 6205 was the reason why DEC didn't use large boards for many
years afterwards; it was a nightmare to service.  Perhaps this is why DEC
wanted so much to destroy all PDP-6s...  ;-(

I have a 6205 from Berkeley's PDP-6, as well as a couple dozen B138s from
SAIL's KA.  There is no way that I'll part with my 6205, but I'll be happy
to let go of some B138s together with photocopies of the prints.  Although
much more common than 6205s, the B138 has its own interesting history.
Make an offer.  ;-)

The problem is with skilled technicians, not parts. The PDP-6
was a dog. It took the entire design team (logic designers
Gordon Bell and Alan Kotok and circuit designers Joe Sutton
and Pat Sullivan (circuit designers don't get the respect of
logic designers, but that's another story)) a year on the
road to make them work in the first place. After they settled
down DEC hired superior people (such as Bob Clements, an MIT
degreed Electrical Engineer, who later was the project
engineer of the KA10) to maintain them. Bob once spent 8
hours finding a marginal 6205 module in the machine at
Brookhaven National Labs.

People of that talent will not make a career of keeping a
PDP-6 at TCM operational.

In the case of your frequency counter we are talking about:

* a trivial device manufactured by a company known for its
  conservative design 
* built in large numbers
* well documented with a theory of operation manual
* being restored by an experienced engineer who is not being
  paid for his time

The PDP-6 had inadequate circuit design:

* transistors stacked as high as 5 deep i.e. 5 Vce drops to
  ground for a grounded signal
* the legendary 6205 card
* the ludicrous connectors on the handle end of the 6205
* AC coupling of the carry bit of the adder

plus:

* every wire in the machine hand soldered on both ends even
  though wire-wrap had been in general use for several years
  at other companies
* DEC was a startup with under 200 people when the project
  was started; they were naive and didn't understand the
  difficulty of the project they were undertaking

The PDP-6 was a disaster. If Digital had taken orders for
50 they would have been driven bankrupt. TCM would be unable
to maintain a PDP-6 even if they wanted to.

Perhaps I should have said:
    It is impractical to keep obscure, poorly designed,
    complicated, old equipment working beyond its
    original design life.

A steam engine is a piece of cake to keep working compared to
a PDP-6. Most operational steam engines are kept working by rail
fans who volunteer their time.

Some are kept working by profit making companies. In an
extreme example of profitability the Silverton--Durango line
pulls 10 cars with perhaps 400 people paying about $30 each
to ride about 8 hours round trip all Summer long. 400 * 30 *
120 = $1.44 million. If I could figure out how to get that
kind of revenue from having a PDP-6 operational I'd try hard
to find someone to make a career of keeping it up. Most
tourist railroads don't make money, close, and sell their
rolling stock; most tourist railroads run mostly diesels.

Out here in San Jose we have 5 beautifully restored trolleys
that operate Summer weekends. They were some of a large
number used as a shanty town in the depression and abandoned
ever since. They were restored by trolley fans as a labor of
love.

parts.

Netcom must have missed the post making the original claim
that TCM is selling parts from a(n almost) complete CDC-6600,
thought to be the last surviving example. If it's true then
I'd be amazed, saddened, and outraged. The 6600 was a
masterpiece.

Let me back up what John says. I may be one of the very few people who 
monitor this group who actually worked on a PDP-6, in fact on the development 
-6 in Maynard; first floor, building 12 (I think that was the building 
number), right across the hall from KO's office. With all the resources we 
had at our disposal, it still was everything DEC could do to keep the damn 
thing up. I think for a period of a couple of years it was Leo Landry's 
career to keep the thing running. He had backup from people like Kotok and 
Clements (Gordon was by this time at CMU), and Dave Gross, Tom Eggars, etc. 
Still the thing crashed multiple times per day. Granted that many of the 
outages were software related, particularly while we were developing the 
swapper, but enough were hardware failures to give some indication of the 
magnitude of the projected effort to keep one functional. While it might be 
nice from a nostalgic point of view to see a real PDP-6 running, I have to 
reluctantly agree it would be somewhat impractical.

I was very disappointed the last time I was there too. I preferred it when the
PDP-1 (with Spacewar), CDC-6600, Illicac IV, and SAGE were on display.

The BCM has an excellent historical collection. They do a lousy job of
displaying it. As has been reported the San Jose Mercury News had a recent
article claiming the BCM was searching for space in Silicon Valley to display
its historical collection. I'll be in line on opening day.

The original timesharing machines were MIT (modified 7094), BB&N (PDP-1)
and Rand Corporation (PDP-1). The first vendor supplied timesharing was
much later--1964, Digital PDP-6.

While I never worked on the ancient iron, I started on a KA-1040.

I clearly remember being told that the KA10 was designed 
to replace the PDP-6 as a maintenance redesign,
not for performance. It wasn't clear that the KA-10 was any faster
at execution, and it duplicated the 6's design with only a small number of 
new instructions or features.

My understanding was that the KA-10 was designed as a PDP-6 that was
practical. Cheaper to build and much cheaper to run and keep up.

No one who ever even looked at a KA or even KL backplane would expect all
that wirewrap to work (1) for a long time or (2) if you _ever_ moved it.

BTW, I was also told by DEC sources at the time of the KL's announcement
that the cost of the PDP-11/40 front end was less than the cost to buy
the switches and wire them on an KI. Since a KL would have required
lots more than the KI, it was much cheaper to the the 11. Too bad, I still like
blinking lights.

PDP-6 was so sensitive (putting a scope probe on a pin could
frequently make a problem go away) that Alan Kotok seriously
considered issuing an ECO to add a 1" twisted-pair to nowhere
on a pin pair as a TINY capacitor to simulate a scope probe.

>>* the legendary 6205 card
>
>Could you enlighten me on this, please.

Mechanics: The 6205 was about 10.5" x 12", a DEC System Module.
It had 2 connectors of about 20 pins on EACH end. There were 37
of them in adjacent slots. The handles were connected by two
bus-bars of 20 wires. They were soft, like 1/16" by 1/8" lead
bars and could be peeled back to remove a module. They totaled
about 1480 connections. The life expectancy was about 10
peelings.

Logic: The PDP-5 had been successful with a pair of cards
implementing a 1-bit slice of AC, MQ, MA, MB, adder, shifter.
The PDP-6 team decided to go one better. The 6205 on a single
card had 1-bit slice of AC, MQ, MA, MB, adder, and shifter. It
was a disaster.

AC carry: the carry propagation from one bit to the next was an
AC pulse, not a DC level. Some 6205s were noisier than others.
You gradually tuned a PDP-6 to have the noisiest modules to the
left where their noise would have fewer bits to propagate their
noise to. If too much noise propagated a carry would be seen
and added when none was intended.

The 6205 had a price of $1K.

What to do with a flaky 6205:
* The production technicians tended to throw them out the
  window and into the mill pond
* When discussing 6205 problems with me the national service
  manager opened a locked drawer of his desk that contained
  about 25 6205s he didn't ever want to see in the field again.
  Knowing they had a list price of $1K he couldn't bring
  himself to throw them in the mill pond
* One time Bob Clements spent over 4 hours finding a noisy
  6205. Having been the longest time he had spent finding a
  problem to date he wrote on it "NFG RCC". Some months later
  he spent 8 hours finding a noisy 6205 in the Brookhaven
  machine. When he finally removed it he noticed the notation
  "NFG RCC" on the card. A few seconds later he lost his
  balance and the card split in two over his knee. He never
  encountered the module in a machine again

It depends on the number of solder joints. The PDP-6 type 166
processor was 4 19" bays 6' tall. The Fast Accumulators (16 36-
bit registers) were another bay. That's a lot more solder
joints than a Tektronix Type 547 scope.

Also if you've got a flaky design it helps to know the exact
routing of every signal wire. With Gardner-Denver wire-wrap
robots you know they're all the same. With human assemblers you
don't.

Paid professionals couldn't keep PDP-6s working when they were
new. Enthusiasts would have a very difficult time 30 years
later.

I've since confirmed:

* BCM loaned it back to LLL, it having not moved
* It was later crated by LLL and is still on LLL premises

If BCM succeeds in building a Silicon Valley facility for
adults then I assume it will be moved there.

BCM has been selling 6600 parts for a long time; I bought a
logic module about a decade ago.

   To quote directly from the "Programmed Data Processor-6 Handbook" (DEC pub.
nr. F-65, dated 8/64 top of page 23 under "TIMING":

    "PDP-6 processors are not synchronized by a clock. Therefore, PDP-6
   systems run asynchronously with as high a duty factor as possible for each
   unit."

   I guess that answers that question; I'd been curious myself, so I just
looked it up. Thankfully, I'd kept a copy of the "Handbook" I found at work!

   Even synchronous processors can wedge between time-states; if a condition
to pre-enable the next time-state is broken, said state will never be entered
with the result of a hang. Finding these problems could be a real joy.

   Microprogrammed systems are less susceptible to faults like this, but I have
seen them vector off uncontrollably into the microstore....

Of course, we all know that the most important feature required for
this type of debugging was the *lamp test* button - which the KA was
not really equiped with (well, you could make them all light, but there
wasn't a button to do it on mine (SN 9 and 44, maybe they added it later?))
or, later, the upgrade LED's...

Yes, lights are sorely missed.  Of course, with the speed of current
systems they would just be a blur anyway...

I've got complete print sets, hardware manuals, and card schematics
for both the PDP-6 and KA-10.  Anyone who REALLY wants a set can get
one from me.  If enough people want them, I'll scan them and put them
on the net.

On another topic, I installed the "magic/more magic" switch on the
MIT-AI PDP-6 which was mentioned here recently.  Originally, the
switch was labelled "magic" and implemented a now-forgotten special
mode in the machine (I think it had to do with allowing user mode I/O
instructions for device codes > 700, if I recall).  The feature was
permanently removed, the switch stayed, and someone later labelled the
other position "more magic."  At this point, it was disconnected,
except for a wire to ground.  I think the story from there is
apocryphal.

Lights were not just for the hardware folks.

I remember spending quite a bit of time figuring out where software
errors were, and what a machine was doing just by looking 
at the lights on the CPU of the KA.  It was really nice, and quite easy,
once one got the "feel" of the system.  Of the two KA's I did most of my 
work on, they did seem to have their little differences, certainly
a personality.

Dave, who's last KA was #1 in the Doomsday lab,
right before it was scrapped. (1979??)

The PDP-10 version was not the first, written by Will Crowther for a CDC box
(probably the 6600, but don't hold me to that).

It *was* the second version, expanded to the 350-point Classic version by Don
Woods of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.  All the versions
since are based on the SAIL port.

David Long of the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business Computing
Facility (which had two of the four DEC20s on campus in the late 70s and early
80s) is responsible for expanding the cave in a number of ways, and pushing
the point count up to 500, then 501 points.  I liked a lot of his additions,
though I felt that changing the Balrog to a Wumpus was Not the Right Thing.

Most of DL's work was in the data files, but he did make some changes to the
parser as well.

Still and all, I'd vote for ZORK as the greatest time-sink on the PDP-10.  On
the other hand, it got me interested in Lisp (in the form of Muddle) and that

Rich Alderson   You know the sort of thing that you can find in any dictionary

                logists, itching to derive one tongue from another that they
                know better: a word that is nearly the same in form and meaning
                as the corresponding word in English, or Latin, or Hebrew, or
                what not.

Well, the answer is "Yes and No".  The PDP-6 was asynchronous.
But so were the PDP-10's (except for the KL-10).  So not much marked
contrast there.

There were a number of reasons why the PDP-6 was hard to keep running,
but that wasn't particularly one of them.  If the machine did hang in
the middle of an instruction, it was pretty easy to tell how far it
had gotten (all those lights were there for a reason) and thus pin
down what small section of logic must have failed.

I don't recall hangs in the middle of a processor sequence being that
common a failure mode.  Memory cycles to the external busses, yes.
But not very often within the processor.

    >It originated on the PDP-10.  I believe it was at SU-SCORE.ARPA.

SCORE was a dec-20 (thus "score".)  SU-AI ("SAIL") preceded it, and
ran WAITS (more tops10-like.)
