I wasn't able to locate the PDP-10 fortran ADVENT in DECUS,
while looking many years ago. Though I vaguely recall there might be
one for the PDP-11.

There are multiple versions of the original PDP-10 code available
on the Internet.

An earlier version (tainted I believe):
  ftp://ftp.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/source/advent-original.tar.gz
Also see (as noted earlier)
  http://www.spies.com/~aek/36bit/games/

and a slightly later one: 
ftp://ftp.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/source/adv350-pdp10.tar.gz
Also see
  http://forums.delphiforums.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=xyzzy&msg=175.1

Compile and install instructions were posted here in this newsgroup
earlier this year. See article thread
  ".run advent, adventure fanatic build procedures."
which should still be retrievable in the groups.google.com archives.

You can get the FORTRAN source from http://www.rickadams.org/adventure/
scroll down to 'adventure downloads'.

If your using the simh pdp10 you'll need a small utility to put that in a
backup tape,
then extract it IN tops10, and of course you need fortran compiler. I got it
running
last January and knowing little about dec it took a while to figure out
mounting
tapes etc. But it can be done!

Yes, I have downloaded this Adventure source before. But IIRC, it
does *not* contain anything that looks like the *original* instructions
for installing the program on a -10. I was looking for the original
-10 distribution documentation along with the source... This is 
more for my own morbid curiosity, rather than for help in installing
the Adventure game.

Tonight I used KERMIT to move the ADVENT source and database files onto the 
real KS10. I installed Fortran with the help of Tim Shoppa's archive and 
instructions I found on the Web. It compiled without an error and runs just 
fine. I can make a backup tape image if anyone is interested.
