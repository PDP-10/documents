Right.  Thanks for the correction.  I've never been able to remember UC vs 
LC, dash or no dash, etc.  I was the one who did all the editing that 
introduced the DECsystem-10 into DEC's documentation.  At the time, there
was a lawsuit going on (I think it was with Singer) about the "spelling"
of the DECsystem-10.  I can't remember how many times I changed the 
spelling from DECSYSTEM-10 to DECsystem-10 to DECSYSTEM10 to DECsystem10
and back again as the lawyers kept changing their minds.  So I have been 
and  always will be cursed with the inability to spell these names 
correctly [grinning emoticon here].

Nope.  Not on the cover.  I'm looking at at book called "pdp10 reference 
handbook", 2nd edition, 1971 of the "pdp10 handbook series".  I guess the 
designers were trying to be cute by not capitalizing _any_ letter (note 
that the title had no capitals).

  Sorry. I was thinking about the iron, and in any event I need to
retract that last statement of mine lest bad information get out.

   The logo on the KI-10's front panel was, indeed, 'pdp10' not
"PDP10". Duh.

   When did DEC make the transition from obvious acronym (PDP) to
"trademark" (pdp) on the equipment (and doco)? A quick guess would
seem to indicate around 1970/71 or so judging from the already extant
-8 line which makes an upper-to-lower transition (between 8/I and 8/e,
I believe). Not, of course, that this has one whit to do with -10s.

I got e-mail from Mark Crispin, who reminded me about the Dolphin.
  Minnow = very small PDP-10, most likely the size of a Rainbow-100 or Pro-350.
  Dolphin = approximately the same size as the 2020, better than VAX-780.
  Jupiter = pie-in-the-sky project, was to be 6 times faster than 1091/2060.

Subject: Minnow

The Minnow project was cancelled before it was capable of running an OS.  The
furthest they got was running EDDT; that means about 10% of the work to
getting a real machine (having worked on both SC-30 and PDP-10 emulator, I can
tell you that getting EDDT to work is easy).
 
Pete Hurley (I think) told an interesting story about the Minnow.  The board
was being sent to the solder bath to solder the ICs, and true to its name it
dived into the solder!
 
As far as I know, the Minnow's final resting place was as a wall decoration.
 
I think, but I'm not sure, that Dolphin had gotten further along before it was
cancelled.  Dolphin would have been a major disaster for DEC marketing; it
would have competed with the VAX 780 at similar pricing but much better
performance.  Jupiter was scaled much larger (as it turned out, too large for
DEC's expertise) to avoid that problem.

Technically, of course, I should have written "WAITS" instead of "SAIL"--the
official name of the operating system was the former.  There were at least four
different things all called "SAIL" relating to the Stanford Artificial Intelli-
gence Laboratory:  The Lab itself, the PDP-10 owned by the Lab and attached to
the ARPANET (later Internet), for a while the OS on that -10, and an Algol 60
derivative (with the "LEAP" data structures, whatever that may mean) where it
stood for "Stanford Artificial Intelligence Language."

WAITS has been relegated to a set of backup tapes written with the DART program
(a SAIL-only utility), archived somewhere by the Computer Science department at
Stanford.  Before being reminded about the hobbyist license for 36-bit OSes, I
was concerned about the fact that WAITS started out as the PDP-10 Monitor
version 3.27 (before it was renamed to "Tops-10" by DEC!), with the Tops-20
PHYSIO adapted to WAITS instead of the Tops-10 stuff; I guess that if one could
demonstrate an executed license, and the sources were available, one could see
them, if Stanford would allow their copyrighted parts to be released...  (Same
problems as at MIT, you know.)

It's complex, isn't it? ;-)

Cool! (re: still using TOPS-20).

If you have a 9-track 1/2" tape drive and would like copies of nearly
every game for TOPS-20 (incl. MIT's Zork, CMU's Haunt, Stanford's Fisk
and Luigi, and, of course, adventure, vttrek, and about eleventy-seven
others), let me know.

Heck, I'll give you the tapes since I have nothing that can read them.

BTW and FYI, I received an email query earlier today about TOPS-20 and
my response is enclosed.  If you know the company name that Len Bosack
and Sandy Lerner founded after they [founded and] left Cisco, I'd really
appreciate knowing since I cannot find any reference to it; they built
a desktop DEC-20 that ran TOPS-20.

Thad

Trivia follows (mostly for Joe but also for the [several] other PDP-10
and TOPS-20 fans out there):

Re:
| > And let's not forget the PDP-10/DEC-20 (KA,KI,KS,KL processors) with
| > its 36-bit word length
| 
| Ah... Now _there_ was a machine, though I don't recall a KS model.
| How did that differ from the KI/KL?

There were 4 (actually 5) models from DEC:

1. the original PDP-6 with transistors.  Paging modification to this became
   the KA PDP-10

2. next generation used ICs, hence the "I" in "KI"

3. the next and most advanced model was the KS in which the "S" stood for
   Schottky.  This was actually the physically smallest model, all self-
   contained in one cabinet about the size of a 17 cu ft refrigerator.
   Disks were still external (RP06, RP07, RP20, etc.)

4. the last model (due to cancelling the Jupiter) was the KL CPU in which
   the "L" stood for its use of ECL logic.  The power supply in that sucker
   had capacitors the size of pony kegs.  :-)

   Architecturally the KS was more advanced than the KL, but the KL ran
   like a bat out of hell.

Other notes:

A. there was a floating-point bug in the KS which never got fixed due to
   hard-coded microcode not being (economically) changeable.

B. three variants of this family:

   1. Foonly (ex-Stanford) made several models (F-1, F-4, etc.) which were
      incredible.  I saw the first one while visiting Stanford one day in
      the LOTS facility, so I opened it up to see what was inside.  Cabinet
      (just one!) was almost empty, yet this was 4x more powerful than the
      DEC-2060s I had at the time.  I later used one F-4 on a contract for
      the US Navy.

      Foonly was based in Palo Alto.

   2. Systems Concepts model SC-1.  Incredible piece of hardware and in
      direct competition with Foonly.  Trouble was the company was run
      totally by engineer-types and they never would solidify the design
      and get it to market, so their funds eventually ran out.  They really
      needed some MBA types in that company to sell the damned thing.

      Systems Concepts was located in San Francisco.

   3. Name escapes me, but it was up in Oregon and the company was formed
      by Len Bosack and Sandy Lerner (yes, the 2 who started Cisco).  They
      made a desktop DEC-20 (about PC-sized) that actually ran TOPS-20.
      Never saw a commercial (and marketed) version of this one, though,
      which is a shame as I would have bought one just to be able to run
      the ORIGINAL versions of Zork, Haunt, dungeon, Fisk, etc. at home.  :-)

    The "High segments" could be constructed so that they were shareable
    (with the .SHR extension).  This saved lots of expensive memory.  When
    shared they were "pure code" and not writable.  Very good teaching
    tool, and it taught me a lot.

Um, they didn't have to be "not writable".  You could do zippy IPC
stuff by writing (very carefully) to the shared area.  Greg Satz and I
wrote an early split-screen "chat" program (for tops10) back in about
1979.  I wrote some rutgers-pascal callable routines for IPC using the
shared highseg, and Greg did everything else (in pascal.)

The general concept was used a lot more often in tops20, where the paging
scheme allowed individual memmory pages to be shared in this manner...

    This company is in business, and is selling TOAD-1 processors that run
    TOPS-20.

The interesting bit of trivia is that cisco was originally conceived to
build a Dec20 clone (and the first product sold was the Massbus Ethernet
Interface System for KL10s.)  As I heard the story (and I guess this is
rumor, since it didn't come direct from Len or Sandy), the networking
gear was sort of a fund-raiser that got out of hand...

The early bits of the TOAD that I saw a year or two before it came out
looked like the final product would be about the same size as a cisco-7000
router - still desk sized to some extent, but more like those supersized
PC server boxes than a single-user PC.

I believe that level D (before version numbers) was the last
TOPS-10 to fit on a DECtape
Level D would also swap on DECtape.

The version numbers I recall (strictly from fallible memory alone) are:
1.91, 2.19, 3.27, 4S50, and 4S72; all pre-Level D. 

Disk/file handling was changed significantly with the introduction of Level-D 
disk service, released with the first 5 series monitor. In its first 
incarnation the Level-D file service routine was one module called FILSER. It 
was written by Tony Wachs from design work by Tony, Chris White, and Tom 
Hastings. It was about this time monitor source editing conventions were also 
introduced as documented in a memo called LEVELD.MEM, written by Tom 
Hastings.

As I recall, the first 5 series release still preserved the old, 
non-standardized AC namings; eg. PDP, TAC, TEMP, etc. These were codified and 
changed by Don Black for the same release that introduced the FILSER split 
into FILIO, FILUUO, and FILINT (I think those were the names), and for which 
I implemented extended RIBs. This was either 5.01 or 5.02, I'm leaning toward 
5.01.

So which drastic change were you referring to?

Most of the above were evolutionary changes introduced over a period of 
years. PPNs (project, programmer numbers) were already in place in the PDP-6 
monitor in the mid-60s. SFDs (sub-file directories) appeared in an early 5 
series release (I think) like 5.01 or 5.02. I don't recall the sequence of 
memory management changes leading from the KA's shuffler to demand paging, 
but I do recall implementing DAEMON enhancements to DCORE and DUMP required 
to support demand paging. This was in 1973-74 or so. I believe this was for 
the first KL implementation but I forget the version number. First KS monitor 
was 1978. I know this one because I ported TOPS-10 to the KS. I almost got 
caught in the great blizzard of '78; I stayed late in Marlboro after DEC had 
sent everybody home so I could get stand-alone time on the development KS. I 
barely made it home.

So "that sort of stuff" actually appeared over a period of 10+ years.

Heck, before CMU got RM10B drums, we had the monitor, editor, SAIL compiler,
and linker on one tape.  Users would usually use two others, one to read
from, one to write to.  With 5 drives, 2 users could use it pretty
comfortably.

TECO was neat - it often started without being read in from the tape.  It
was the only program that could initialize its own data area, the LOSEG.
Code lived in the HISEG, and the OS would try to keep that in core.

That was in 1969, and the 4N50 monitor, even before it was renamed
TOPS-10.

Happy day after DEC-10 day!

Last week, Tim Litt called me to tell me that KL1026 (nee' GIDNEY) 
was to be turned off and scrapped.  When Jim died, I had expressed 
a desire to see a PDP-10 one last time, so Tim thought I would like
to visit the -10 before it went away.  Needless to say, this news was
upsetting.  I cried off and on until I went to see the -10 on 5-Dec-97.  
And this is how I did it.

Underneath my sweat shirt, I wore the first tee-shirt that the TOPS-10
folks had produced.  Its front had the words "THE REPORTS OF MY
DEATH HAVE BEEN GREATLY EXAGGERATED" and the back
had a dipiction of a video terminal with the words (DEC system-10
continued).  I fought long and hard to this put on the back; but that's
another story.  In my carry-all, I placed the picture of Jim and Tony
in front of CHIP that had been taken at a DECUS.

Tim met me in the lobby of MRO-1 and walked me to the machine
room.  As soon as I entered the room, the smells hit me.  I had
never before realized that a -10 had a unique smell.  All kinds of
memories started to manifest themselves.  I almost expected to
see Jim and Tony debugging at the console.

The system was orange (darn) and was down.  Apparently, the
system pack had been munged, an RP06 was dead (one of two),
the tape drives weren't working, and the floppy drives didn't seem
to work.  Tim was trying to get the system into a state so that
some of the information on the packs could be saved to media
readable by other non-PDP-10 systems.  This was the second
time that I had observed a PDP-10 not cooperating when it
was scheduled to be torn apart System 40/2 was the other one;
in System 40's case the KL and the KI systems both helped
to prevent its demise (but that's yet another story).

Tim finally got a monitor loaded from a KLAD pack but that pack
was so old the microcodes for the tapes weren't in it.  He finally
found a KLAD (after I had reassured him that I had KLADs built
so that all hardware could be detected and found) that finally
could see the tape controller.  But the tapes didn't work--lots
of hard errors.  

I went into the back room where lots of tapes and packs were
kept.  There was a hit and miss of RE tapes.  I was surprised
at my ability to figure out what the tapes were and what should
be on them.  I had thought that I had forgotten all that stuff.

For some reason, Tim wanted to boot the TOAD (yup, I got to
meet one :-)) so I played with the -10 on the console for while.
Just doing a directory of SYS: brought back knowledge.  I
ran DDT and was surprised that I could do DDT commands 
without a cheat sheet.  I tried to solve a conundrum that
somebody had given me but failed.  I opened a file with
TECO.  And, while I was doing all this playing, I occasionally
petted the -10.

Meanwhile, Tim had forgotten his password on the TOAD.  I
watched him boot up TOPS-20 with the /DDT switch and 
look at locations.  Remember all the times we used to watch
Jim and Tony debug the monitor on Wednesday mornings?
There was a taste of that in the air.

Tim finally succeeded in getting a magtape drive to work on
the TOAD and successfully read an REtape to disk and 
save that info to another magtape.  Those TOADs have a 
nice PDP-10 feel to them.  I do wish there were lights [wistful 
emoticon here].

By that time, the pain that this disease has bestowed upon me had 
become too severe for me to stay any longer, so I left.   I don't know 
if there was any kind of party like the one they had for KL2102.  I 
didn't go to that party; I just watched the party from afar for a couple 
of minutes.  (I said good-bye later to KL2102 when there was nobody 
around.)

This is the end of an era that should never be forgotten.  I'm just
glad that Jim and Tony didn't have to see it.

I think it's an interesting commentary on the backwards compatibility 
philosophy of TOPS-10 development that DEC continued to rely for maintenence 
releases on SOUP, a suite of programs for which the sources were lost in the 
far mists of time. Because no maintenence could be done on CAM, FED, COMERG, 
etc., we at least always made sure these CUSPs would run.

This note has not reached my news server so far. The real KL1026 
was scrapped before 1993? 

I thought that the real sn# 1026 as possed to the node called KL1026::
was replaced with SN# 1042, as SN#1026 had problems and then was latter
replaced with the DECSYSTEM-20 (Orange rather than the Blue DECsystem-10
that 1042 and 1026 where) SN#2871 was GIDNEY:: nee KL1026::

	I think that right

I thought nee meant born.   The KL first christened as GIDNEY eventually
was the only KL left, AFAIK.  Since the people tending the machine ran
TOPS-10 on it, the node was called KL1026.  There's the software and then
there's the hardware.  I tend to think of machines as hardware no matter
what DECnet calls them :-).

   You gave a PDP-15 a home? Wonderful! That, then, makes two I know
survived (yours is one, the other is in the Smithsonian in the USA).
I missed out on one once by less than a half-hour and still regret
it.

One difference was on PDP-6 400000,000000 / 2 = 0 instead of
600000,000000.

This was reported in 1969 on the KA10 as a FORTRAN bug.
The FORTRAN compiler maintainer, not one of DEC's wizards,
looked at the code, single stepped with DDT and submitted
it as a DDT bug.  The DDT maintainer determined that the
hardware was getting the wrong answer.  Alan Kotok verified
it by using his KSR-35 to login to KA10 #2.  He checked the
flowchart, saw the bug.  He couldn't believe Leo Gossell's
diagnostics didn't check this edge case.

Checking the sources he saw that Leo had checked this case.
Unfortunately his simulation (not using the IDIV instruction
under test) implemented the algorithm in the flowchart, which
had the bug.

Kotok thought the bug might have been in the PDP-6 also.  He
returned to his KSR-35, switched his A-B box from KA10 to PDP-6
and logged on.  Sure enough the PDP-6 had the bug too.

An ECO was issued for the KA10.  Alan said, "The last thing
you want to do to a PDP-6 is get a soldering iron near its
wiring."  No ECO was issued for the PDP-6.

Anyone have a program that depends on this PDP-6 bug? :-)

I remember Jim Flemming doing a little research project (it
must have been in the late 70s) that involved finding the
results of 0/0.  Every processor (KA/KI/KL/KS) had a _different_
result.  But I don't know any of details.  CDO?  Do you remember?
I don't even remember what started the project.  I do remember
Jim being tickled to death about it :-).

Were you still with Mike and Stewart when they delivered an SC-30M to Stanford
in 1986?  I didn't meet everyone at SC; mostly, I worked with Fred Wright, and
occasionally Bertram or Pete Sampsen.

I can't believe it. These things are so thin on the ground someone
MUST give it a home. I rescued the last operational KL in England from
the scrapmen, although I have since lost the I/O cabinet in an
accident. I also saved the last 2020 and the last pdp-15. If I lived
within a thousand miles of this one I'd rescue it as well.

Actually, what DEC called PA1050 was correctly known as the
compatibility package
and was written for TENEX at BBN (by Wally Weiner (with only a little
help from me))
It went as part of the TENEX - Virtual Memory - Murphey package To DEC

   That may very well be correct, the Compatibility Package was
originally
written to go with Level B of the Monitor (Don't remember if "TOPS" was
in use then)
(Level B did fit on DECtape, though)

Well, I don't think I've ever met Dan Murphy, but my wife glared at me when I
started shouting "That's a DEC-10!  That's a DEC-10!  Did you see the DECtapes?
That's what those little rings were!"

Then they came and gave me my shot, and I was all better again. ;->

    I've had two other reports, so it's probably true.
    
    The shot was taken in the early 70s when I was at BBN, i.e. before
    moving to DEC.  It was in the computer room at BBN, where we had
    two KA-10s as I recall.  I can't really remember what the context
    was for the visit of the film crew, but in the following months, a
    number of people told me they had seen me in a shot described very
    much as this one, teletype, KA-10, and all.
    
    Channel 2/PBS must have liked the shot, since I had reports of it
    turning up for several years thereafter.  However, nobody has
    mentioned it for a *very* long time before now.  Apparently, the
    PBS film file search must turn up that shot when somebody goes
    looking for "man-working-at-computer (old)" or some such!  :-)
    
    The irony is, I have never seen it!  My TV watching is, shall we
    say, minimal.  It may be too late now, but if there is a repeat,
    maybe I can plan to tape it.

Well, I should probably say that what I heard in DEC as an employee may
not be what the field saw.  There seemed to be strange discrepancies
that I never really understood what with disclosures, announcements,
etc.  I just took on the attitude that what I knew was proprietary
since I never had any idea which subjects were OK to talk about.
Some days an item was OK, then it would be not-OK, then it would be
OK.  I just left all that up to the guys to figure out and followed
their lead.

To give an idea of where on the video tapes the shot may be:  _A Science 
Odyssey:  Bigger, Better, Faster_.  It's a two-hour show and, IIRC, the
film of Dan and the KA-10 is in the last half-hour.  I didn't recognize
the system to be a KA-10 but then the clip was so short that I had trouble
figuring out if the person was you :-).  One of the first things to go is
the eyes.

Amazing where my old addresses turn up.  I wonder if spammers will
harvest that one now.  And whether it still works.

DIGEX was Doug Humphrey, who went on to found a company of that name
seven years later, and who sold it for tens of millions of dollars
last year.

Amazingly, I've met all but two of the people mentioned in that To:
line.  And exchanged e-mail with those two.  I still have current
e-mail addresses for most.

Imminent death of the net, film at 11.  In the 70s and 80s it looked
like the net was always on the verge of going away or becoming
inacessable.  At least for unofficial users like me.

Chris Stacy started as another guest user, but he was hired by MIT to
keep the rest of us guest users in line.  He soon gained a reputation
as "the incredible flushing man" for his eagerness to delete accounts.

Hardly.  It was trivially easy to get kicked off in those days.
Most guest users eventually were.  However, I *still* have a guest
account at MIT, even though I no longer need it.  So does Doug
Humphrey, even though he needs it even less.

The good side was that spamming was unimaginable.  There was *one*
instance of a chain letter in the 80s, and only one of its recipients
forwarded it to anyone else.  The original sender and the forwarder
both permanently lost their accounts within an hour, and probably
faced criminal charges.

Note that Jerry Pournelle was kicked off simply for *mentioning* the
net in a magazine article, and for not apologizing or promising never
to do it again.

The *last* person to be kicked off the net was the infamous Sanford
Wallace, in October of last year.  To get kicked off, he had to send
several BILLION spams, over and over to the same recipients, and
refuse to honor any remove requests.  And then it took over a year.

(In another decade, when net access will be more important than having
a phone or a drivers license, I bet he'll regret it.)

I think there's some middle ground.  It shouldn't be extremely easy
to get someone kicked off the net.  But neither should it be almost
impossible, if they're deliberately and repeatedly harassing tens of
millions of people and refusing to stop.

Sounded to me like Jerry wasn't kicked off of arpanet, he was just kicked
off of MIT's guest-accessable computers, and couldn't figure out the
difference.  AFAIK, in those days it would have been real close to
impossible to kick someone off "the arpanet", since access was mostly
through entities with their own user-control.  No ISPs, no "pure" services
that you could access without a host to roost on.  (Ie, once Jerry got
kicked off MIT, there would have been nothing to stop him from getting
guest accounts at stanford or simtel or wherever, except "word of email"
(not such a small thing in those days, I guess.))

    Well, my take on it is that the "One Company, One Strategy, One
    Message" directive of the mid '80s was the death knell of the
    company.  Of course, it was part of the justification for killing
    off the 36-bit line, but that's only a small part of the problem.
    DEC could have prospered very well without 10/20 line, sentiments
    of this group notwithstanding, but it would eventually need
    something beside or beyond VAX/VMS, and nobody was allowed to say
    or even think that, much less do anything to move in that
    direction.

    DEC grew and became successful originally because it was a hotbed
    of ideas, a lot of them got tried, and some of them were very
    good.  Product line managers had a lot of autonomy, and yeah, so
    they competed with one another, but so what?  One or the other of
    them would get the business, and so DEC got the business.
    Somehow, by the mid-80's Ken Olsen developed delusions of
    infallability or something, in marked contrast to the caution that
    he was formerly well known for, and promulgated this One Egg, One
    Basket strategy (as we all called it).  Of course, the company
    didn't begin to decline immediately, but I would say that DEC's
    peak was around 1987 -- only a few years after monotheism took
    root.

    The idea that DEC as a whole could only do one thing, or that
    everything had to fit into some overarching strategy, remained a
    totally ingrained part of the corporate culture up through the
    time I left in 1992.  The result was that DEC stopped doing
    aggressive new things or was years late doing them.  The corporate
    culture was wedded to VAX and VMS as if they would live forever.
    Even Alpha was initially, and through most of its design period,
    intended as a faster hardware engine for VMS.

    A piece of this shifting mindset that, I believe, led to DEC's
    decline included that we had to stop being a "technology push"
    company and start building what marketing said was needed.  Doing
    things because they were neat and with the expectation that they
    might create new markets and new business became politically
    incorrect!  'Course, DEC never had marketing that was worth squat
    anyhow, and the history of the past decade is that people make BIG
    money by doing new things and creating new markets.  Even if you
    look at the infamously marketing-oriented companies like Microsoft
    and Compaq, you see that good marketing means selling the s**t out
    of what you have, not inventing the products that are going to be
    pivotal in 3 or 4 years.

    It is interesting to compare HP and DEC.  HP, like DEC, had a
    culture of having multiple product lines that pursue their
    business with much autonomy and aggressiveness.  They kept the
    company structed that way, however.  I think it was David Packard
    who said, "you've got to eat your own lunch, or your competitors
    will eat it for you."  In other words, you have to continually
    bring out new products that beat your existing ones, or your
    competitors will do it.  In the late 80's, DEC and HP were about
    the same size, but, funny thing! HP has continued to grow it's
    revenues by double-digit percentages each year, while DEC's
    revenue has been flat for a decade.  HP now has over twice the
    revenue of DEC, and their stock price has increased several fold.
    DEC stock price (before the Compaq deal) was about 1/4 of what it
    was in 1987.

    I believe the fundamental reason that DEC topped out in 1987 is
    that KO decided all of DEC had to fit in one box and march to one
    tune.  Many good projects were killed off in that era -- projects
    that would have given the company life after VAX but were killed
    because nobody was allowed to imagine life after VAX until it was
    too late.

That was a very small hardware project that somebody in the PDP-10
area solved and tried to get the powers-that-be to offer the device
to our customers.  IIR, it essentially was a battery-powered clock
that would ship the date/time down to the -10.  It was around the
time that the MX-10 (I can't remember the right cybercrud) was
cancelled and noone was particularly interested in any new hardware 
toys for the product line.  Later, the guy with the idea had moved
on and there was nobody with any time to carry the project through
the slings and arrows of release.

I agree.  I just reread my message, and I will stand by it.  Every word
is accurate to the best of my recollection.  Did Chris actually read my
message, or just someone's excerpt?

I admit I could be wrong about what Chris Stacy was hired for.
But not about that fact that he *did* police guest accounts with
sufficient vigilance that he was often called "the incredible flushing
man".  I am quite sure about the MIT guest policy, since I had a guest
account on one or more ITS systems from the time they instituted
passwords (1979?) to the time ITS was finally shut down (May 1990),
and know lots of others who had them, many of whom lost them.  I am
quite sure about the reasons why Jerry Pournelle was flushed, unless
there were some hidden reasons not discussed in the messages that I
read online at the time, and which were distributed at SF conventions
by Hobbit (Al Walker) shortly afterwards, and which were just reposted
here by Tim Shoppa on the 24th.

I apologize for harping on this.  I know that it's boring to read
defenses like this.  But I dislike being falsely accused of posting
inaccurate information.

<snip cogent analysis>

The first odor of trouble that I detected was when the financial types
insisted that the R&D budget be reduced to "industry standard".  This
happened around the time, IIR, Dan started to take #546 stand-alone.
The figures that I remember (and these could be very wrong) were that
DEC was budgeting 10% and the standard was 4%.  

Later, when the 36-bit world moved to Marlboro, I had an office in
the area where the financial types worked.  I distinctly remember
a conversation where the financial type commented that he knew
where the company should be headed and would use the budget to
take DEC there.  

This may be one of the dangers of taking a company public.

Right number of bits,  but not for anything not built out of M modules. (PDP
8/I and later,  it sounds most like like the core stack for a PDP-15.

The PDP-1,4,5,6,7 core modules were packaged in big bulletproof metal cases,
gold in color, diode modules sticking out of the top with T-bar handles to
screw the units into massive sockets similar to the old DEC System Building
Block module connectors. They weighed about five pounds each. 

The PDP-8 modules were black metal boxes, and I *believe* the PDP-9 and early
PDP-10 modules were also enclosed in steel, not naked.

The later core modules, especially the PDP-15 mods, consisted of a pair of
DEC-shaped souble-height modules covered with 1nXXX glass diodes, the core
planes between them, with support, as described, provided by screws and
spacers. All, to my knowledge, originally had connectors on braded pairs of
wires coming off the top which led to G-series sense amp modules.

Well, there's two sides to this. Sometimes the best thing to do is to
kill some projects. Honeywell comes to mind. At one point, they had 4
36-bit operating systems: GCOS, Multics, CP-6, and a follow-on to
GCOS. Rather than putting eggs in one basket, all four were allowed to
continue, so none really had the resources to succeed.

That said, I think a fundamental fact has still not been grasped by
many managers: central management can't make anything happen. They can
*stop* things from happening, and sometimes that's needed, but that
power must be used carefully.

Whether there should be one, two or more OSs really depends on the
the target customer.  There were fundamental differences between
the OSs that DEC had and, depending on what one wanted to accomplish
with the computes, the system user community, the system support
personnel and the hardware would determine which OS was used.

For instance, with TOPS-10 and TOPS-20, there were a lot of things
that could be done with TOPS-10 that one couldn't do with TOPS-20
and there were a lot of things that could be done with TOPS-20
that couldn't be done easily with TOPS-10.  There was also a lot
of commonality between the two.  

The problem was, in my view, that the experts of operating systems
were never asked for an objective evaluation.  There was a lot of
religiousity subtlely supported by upper middle management (and
perhaps some of the top management).

There usually weren't two teams although, because the styles
the OSs were written in were different, there were essentially
two budgeting efforts; but the second time around usually went 
faster.  The strengths of TOPS10 (SMP, to be specific) couldn't 
be done in TOPS20.  IIRC, Jim and Dan spent some time looking at 
that but I don't know the details.  I don't know if it was hardware
or software constraints or both.

Then they need to be taught (are they people who used to
be tech types?).  I'm thinking about that but I haven't
figured out a solution ....yet :-).

This isn't right.  We never "supported" SMP KIs.  I suspect that a
10/77 was Master/slave (don't use asymmetric) multiprocessing with two
K-10s.

And just to add another $.02 worth, both the 10/55 and 10/77 monitors were 
actually implemented to support up to five processors in a master/slave 
configuration. To set the record straight, PDP-10 multiprocessing was not

Monitor, but I can't remember which release. I implemented the scheduler

Well, let me help you; I don't think I'll be able to remember the 
number of the monitor Tape Prep was editing at the time but....

When the dual system was in the basement of Building 5, I volunteered
my group (the RUNOFF group) to do their work on that system which
was sorely in need of a load test.  Now, that was in 1972.  While
we were helping to load test, I got fired from Tape Prep and, as 
part of my "cleaning up before I left" effort, I had to pull the
group out of the load test mix; the group leader replacing me 
didn't know how to test and didn't want to know.  That was the
hardest part of leaving that job...not being able to participate
in the monitor development.

Now my next job was in System 40 Operations.  Eventually, they sent
me to "monitor school" and the sources that I looked at were 5.06
(I think).  And, now for the life of me, I can't remember the
name of the module that handled the dual-CPU "device driver"; it
was the ancestor of CPUSER or was it CPNSER?   Wasn't there a
CP0SER and CP1SER?  Somebody's got to have the Customer Supported
Tape contents somewhere.  Take a look at the first page of that
module and it should give a date or some indicator.

<snip>

I didn't know any of this!  Thanks.  I do remember people talking
about Mike Church.  Did anybody ever run master/slave with more
than two CPUs?  I don't remember anybody (that doesn't mean a thing
though) and JMF did his analyses on M/S performance on only two.
This conclusions that Jim reached based on these analyses were the
impetus for JMF and TW to begin working on an SMP design.

I think I have the slides that they used for their DECUS talks.  Is
this stuff useful and should it be stored in bits somewhere safe?

Just to add a bit more pedantry to the discussion:

When the DECsystem-10 name came about, the slash disappeared in the model names.
Bentley College (my alma mater) had a DECsystem-1070.

Also, as BAH mentioned, the 1077 was AMP.  The SMP system was called the
1099, I believe.  Of course that may have been the version that allowed
1091 style systems to participate in SMP. (1091s came with internal memory
channels, and therefore couldn't run SMP, which required external channels
and shared external memory boxes.)

Entertaining tidbit: towards the end, the third machine in the
KL1026/KL1042/KL2476 tri-SMP development system was a 1091, with both
internal _and_ external channels!  You could take it out of tri-SMP and run
it standalone by just switching which channels were configured via RSX-20F
commands.

What was even more entertaining was that the system had access to the same
CI-based disks (RA60 and RA81 models, which supported 18-bit sectors) that
the rest of the gang did.  All the disks were connected to two HSC50
controllers, one via the A path, the other via the B path.  If I remember
correctly, 1026 and 1042 were connected to one HSC, and 2476 was connected
to the other one.  In tri-SMP operation, you could load-balance the disks
across the CPUs by having some disks forced to the A path and others forced
to the B path.  (Forcing was done by making sure that only one of the
A-path/B-path buttons was pressed in on the front panel.)

If I remember correctly, the steps to take KL2476 standalone and mount a
couple of the SMP system's disks there went like this:

0. Make sure that any disks that were to STAY on 1026/1042 were forced to
the A path.  The Monitor would notice that the path to 2476 had gone away
and would transparently initiate a new virtual circuit to the other path.

1. Tell OPR to go into CONFIG mode and remove CPU2.

        Any disks that were only visible to the system via that CPU would
        be automatically dismounted.  This included the RP06 that held KL2476's
        RSX20F front-end file system, since that disk was dual-ported between
        the PDP-11 and the -10.
        The CPU would be removed.

2. Put a pre-built KL2476 standalone system disk on kl2476's dual-ported RP06 
   spindle, and boot.  The RSX20F on that disk was configured for a system with
   internal channels only, and therefore set up the machine to ignore the
   external channels, and the memory thereon.


Anyone who remembers care to comment?

Stopgap (and SOS) came from the Stanford AI Lab.  It was called
that because it was a non-display-oriented editor thrown together
quickly when the PDP-6 (I'm pretty sure this was before the -10)
came into use.  They already knew (from experience on the PDP-1)
that display editing was the way to go, but it took a while to
get TVEDIT done.  [This is secondhand information, since all that
happened before I came to Stanford, but I'm pretty sure about it.]

The reason Stopgap lasted long enough to have a Son is that for
many years, real display support at SAIL was limited to terminals
in the building; people used SOS when editing from home.

Yup.  That's the name [smiling emoticon here checking for gray hairs].
Speaking of the "X" appended to the modules' names, that reminds me of
a story.

When TW (Tony Wachs) made the decision to leave DEC, I threw a going
away party for him.  I figured out a lot of "gag" gifts for him.  One
of my listing binders was the original DTASRX light blue cardboard
binder and it still had the label on it (I kept everything :-)).

CDO (Chuck O'Toole) volunteered to scrounge up an original copy 
of DTASRX (TW wrote the device driver and it was always his baby)
and assembled it to make a CREF listing.  He has a great story
about the gnashes of teeth it required to do that because he had
to use LOADER among other things.  Because of CDO's tenacity, I
could build a package for TW's gift which consisted of a spoon,
a cup (which Jim searched all of Marlboro and found in Alan
Titcomb's office although I don't remember what was on the cup),
a jar of Taster's Choice and the DTASRX listing.

For those of you who didn't have the pleasure of seeing TW 
working, he was always carrying a listing, a spoon, instant
coffee and a cup with him wherever he went.

After the party, when all but about six of us had left, TW
and Pat White spent quite a while reading the listing, having
great laughs, remembering "when this happened" and "Oh, I
remember now, that was when...".   It was a great party.

They didn't do the software.  The only two people that I know who
could tell the real story are Jim and Duane.  For instance, I don't
remember when they went to three. 

ORNL was the site that eventually ran 5 CPUs and (I think) 
their JOBMAX was 500 of necessity.  One of the
biggest problems, IIR, was memory.  Since DEC had cancelled development 
of the MX20 (is that the name of the damn thing?), the multi-ported
memory box, ORNL had to go to AMPEX to get the 8-ported memory 
required for running the 5.  

This story is one example of how a customer and the TOPS10 Monitor
Development Group cooperated by exchanging needs and ideas to 
produce some of the best software and system innovations.  This
customer did not waste our time nattering about typos and minor
irritations that could be communicated via SPR's FYI procedure.
We considered these types to be "good" customers.  When they
called or SPR'ed something as a problem, it was really a problem.

ORNL was the first customer installed Tri-SMP system.  But Jim and I
built the first working one in the MRO lab.

I was working on a little AD project, the idea being to closely couple
a TOPS10 system with a TOPS20 system.  Fred Engel was working the TOPS20
side.  About the same time, Jim and Duane were talking about going to more
than 2 processors for ORNL.

The master/slave monitors used CP1SER which really didn't work for more
than two processors.  For SMP, I upgraded it to CPNSER and while it worked
fine for 2 systems, it was really never tested with more.  The KL-10
memory boxes really couldn't handle more than two without performance
degradation (only 4 arbitrated ports and the processors needed 2 each for
interleaved fetch).  Since our development machines were also the main
user machines, they were unwilling to recable the memory boxes.

Jim and I thought we could kill two birds if we took KL2136 (I think) and
had Field Service install an external memory interface (forget the option
number) and use two priority ports of the external memory boxes.  Since
we could enable or disable the internal memory of the -20 with the console,
this would give us a system for my debugging (TOPS10 on two, TOPS20 on the
third), or for Tri-SMP debugging using only the shared external memory.

My AD project got canned (and rightfully so!) but the lab setup was used
to run Tri-SMP occasionally.  We would periodically boot the Tri SMP monitor
and later remove the -20 system with System Sleep/Config.

ORNL used AMPEX memory at that time and had more arbitrated ports available
so they didn't have the potential memory starvation problems we had in the
lab. Jim championed the Tri SMP project to marketing and they decided it
had enough merit to sell.  I forget how much in funding we got to do a
project that was already done and tested.  Duane, on the other hand, just
couldn't stand by and be running a supported configuration, so he bought
a 4th processor and eventually a 5th.

John,

I was with the Pitt Comp Sci Dept when our 1055 system arrived and so I'd
put the time around early '72.  By summer '73 we had added a single KI 
system and we planning to upgrade it to a dual as well.  By Fall '73, I
was working at DEC.

You may also be right about the original KA/KI monitors being able to handle
5 processors but by the time I saw CP1SER, there were many 1 Master/1 Slave
assumptions.  Like 0 is *always* the master (system sleep/reconfigure needed
to have the "policy" CPU be elected and float since you could take CPU0
offline for service).  Places were the code wanted to notify "the other" CPU
needed to become "all other active" CPUS.  Stuff like that.

DEC gave explicit permission for customers to copy obsolete software
documentation in the front of their Jan '85 Software Documentation
Directory.  I have the relevant passage in the README file in
ftp://ftp.dbit.com/pub/pdp8/doc, which is full of scanned-in PDP-8
software documentation.  The notice doesn't specifically say it's OK
to store copies in a retrieval system etc. but it doesn't say it's
not OK either, the directory has been growing for 2 years and DEC's
lawyers haven't beaten my door down yet for what that's worth.
Hopefully they'd ask me to remove the directory first if they had a
problem anyway, and of course I would comply.

It says "customers" may copy obsolete SW docs but not the world in
general, I don't know how serious they are about that but of course it
wouldn't hurt for people who've never bought anything from DEC to call
DECdirect and order a printer ribbon or something just to make it official!

That should cover software, since AFAIK the only PDP-10ish software doc
that isn't out of print is the processor ref manual, fair enough since
it isn't really a SW doc (just happens to be part of the T20 doc set)
and anyway maybe it *is* out of print by now.  Hardware is another issue,
I don't think they've ever given any kind of blanket permission to copy
HW docs.  Practically speaking of course there's no way they're going to
beat you up over it, even if they decided to come down on you my understanding
is that for copyright infringement they'd have to prove damages to get
anything more than making you stop copying it, and that would be pretty
hard to prove (since they probably haven't sold a KA10 hardware doc in
20 years, you can't really hurt their sales).  But it would still be
nice to get official permission...

There never was an 8K system.  It was part of the pulling of
wool over KO's eyes.  The $99K configuration with:

* 2 level priority interrupt
* no memory protection and relocation
* no fast registers
* no floating point instructions
* no byte instructions
* 8K memory
* paper tape & KSR/35 only I/O
* 5.5K FORTRAN compiler

was never built.  So the 10/10 and 10/20 monitors
weren't either.  Ken signed off on the project when the
Large Computer Engineering group gave him a proposal saying
this was NOT a PDP-6 style mainframe.  It was a single user
real-time system with minimum configuration of $99K and
typical configuration of $149K.

I would like to talk about this.  Unbundling was done for a variety 
of reasons (from my point of view--I'm not talking about those 
strange marketing types).  We had several problems that we wanted
to solve and were never happy with the solution called unbundling.
We never did figure out a better way.  We did fight hard and long 
against several unbundling efforts; the last one was the Phase III
DECnet monitor sources of TOPS10.

From what I recall, unbundling allowed us to:

1.  Make extra money for software innovations.
2.  Keep the problem reports limited to the customers who 
actually used the software (some customers had a habit of writing
many, many SPRs and this was a real serious, time-consuming problem
to us).  This point should probably be expanded but I'll keep it
short for the moment.
3.  Another group figured out that unbundledness would help keep
track of what the customers had.  In the old days, I _think_ that
this information was communicated to Maynard via the salesmen, but
I'm not sure about that.  

4.  I'm sure there were more reasons given for unbundling but I
can't recall them at the moment.

<snip>

When we did SMP, Jim and Tony were very careful to _not_ preclude
more than two CPUs.  They wanted to have 1-8 CPUs supported from
the beginning, but we had our rules about not supporting something
that we couldn't test, debug, reproduce problems, etc.  Since Duane
started talking about upgrading to 3 whilst Jim and Tony were 
developing for only two, Jim tried to get the product line to agree to
support for tri-SMP.  That idea was nixed in flames; they did not
buy our argument that, if there was a tri-SMP dependent problem, we
could debug it at ORNL.  

So, what we did was very carefully keep all documentation from 
saying two or dual or any limitation on the number of CPUs 
supported.  (And that was a constant battle with documentation, 
the product line people, and marketing.)  Instead of having a 
number put in the docs, we insisted that the term "multi-" be 
used.  The only place where two was mentioned was the beware 
file (remember those?) and, I believe, there were only three
instances where dual had to be changed to multi.

So, the plan was that, after we shipped 7.01, the first SMP monitor,
the only things that had to be done for supporting tri-SMP were:

1.  Change the beware file from dual to multi; estimated manpower 
5 seconds using a TECO macro.

2.  Write an SPD; estimated manpower 1 week.

3.  Resubmit the CPNSER tape to SDC with the changed beware file; no
changes to the source; estimated time 1 month for Release Engineering's 
complete process of submission.

4. No documentation changes were required; estimated manpower was 0.

So there we were; 7.01 had shipped; Duane had already added the 3rd
CPU and Software Engineering had successfully argued that it should
be supported.  Jim had the beware file modified and the files had
been handed to Magee for the tape making process.   Then somebody
got the great idea that we had to go through the project notebook
cycle (whatever the hell they called it--I forget now) that a major
release went through in order to get all the powers-that-wanna-be
to agree that "this is good".

It took Jim 9 months to push through the submission; and, when Jim
pushed, things happened.   We could not believe what kind of release
mess we (DEC) had created for ourselves.  It was our first awareness
that this process was actually designed to hinder productivity.  Jim,
Tony, and I had a bout of depression and I had my initial prescience 
of the future of TOPS10.  I began to fight for our existence.  We lost.

	Always a good thing - the money had to come from somewhere.
Most of the profits from the 36 bit line were being used to fund the 
fledgling 32 bit line.  This made a lot of 36 bit people unhappy.
The 32 bit people seemed to think that it was due them.

	But that's a flame war I'd rather not engage now...

	Yes, and having been a field person, I could tell you stories...
But merging two or more -10's into a multiprocessor system was a little 
more involved than some joker deciding to rewrite Dave Nixon's sort 
algorithims...  Running a multiprocessor system required a real
competent customer, not someone who wanted "plug and play".

	(Did everyone realize how much site prep it took to sell a
10 or 20; we had to complete a very long Customer Support Plan before 
Marlboro would commit to sell and ship a system).

	Yes, it was, through the chain of command.  However, before
the days of license management, it was easy to take the tape out to 
the customer site and install something in a less than legal and DEC 
management sanctioned manner...

	Probably the most basic reason: better account control.  (And

I agree that a flame war is inappropriate but some of this discussion
may generate painful memories.  I think it is important that we talk
about this.   Do you have a suggestion of ground rules?

A lot of this problem was based on the way we kept the books.  
Up until (I think) the early 80s, there wasn't a track of how 
much money the 36-bit business brought in.  IIR, it was sort 
of lumped in with something else.

No.  Would you elaborate a bit?  I never had the opportunity to 
talk with people from the field.  And I'm not sure that Jim and
Tony did much either.  It certainly wasn't a part of our formal
procedures.  The information flow from the field was quite 
minimal, IMO, and most of the opportunities got mushed into those
few days at DECUS.

This was also a strength with some dubious side-effects.  A good
field person, with a few sleight-of-hands, was the cause of a lot
of additional sales.  This was how our customers became an extended
family and a part of why they liked PDP-10s.

Account control seemed to be at the bottom of everything.  I've
been trying to imagine how in the world we could have dealt with
a distribution on the order of millions and also kept the quality
standards that we had.  We had problems dealing with 1000 CPUs
out in the field;  I can't imagine how we could have dealt with
2000 (let alone 1,000,000) and still have maintained the quality
we imposed on ourselves.  Just considering the SPR procedures 
becomes a mind-numbing exercise.

And the 10/30 had 16K.  It was the 8K memory and the two monitors:
    10/10 paper tape only
    10/20 DECtape
that weren't built.

There was a time in 1969 when #2 ran the 10/50 monitor all the time.
10/40 customers complained that their monitor was very unstable.
Management decreed that #2 would run the 10/40 monitor 1/2 day
every week.  The monitor group chose Friday mornings from 08:00 to
13:00.  They of course started coming in at 13:00.  The machine sat
in the idle loop for five hours, not achieving the testing
management had hoped for.

Chuckle.  Yup, that's how they played the game [grinning emoticon here].
We went to extraordinary efforts to "out-psych" ourselves so that 
every monitor load would get tested.  It got more complicated in
Marlboro because we didn't have System 40 for a timesharing system (I'm
talking about the general timesharing service that was provided from
Building 5-B.

One of the "rules" established, after much debate, was 3 crashes and
drop back.  If the monitor designated by the monitor guys crashed
three times, operations could drop back to the previous week's load.
If that load didn't run (and here I'm hazy about the heuristics), there
was a drop-back drop-back procedures.  There were a few times when the
monitor that was finally run was the maintenance build.  A maintenance
build used to be called the SOUP monitor and was shipped as n.nnx where
n.nn was the major version of a monitor release and x was A, B, ... or
Z.  I can't remember if we ever shipped a 5.0nC.

I seem to recall many long nights integrating Cyphernetics' (it wasn't
ADP yet) changes into 5.02C.  So yes, you did.  It was the first 5 series
monitor we tried.

The story I had heard about GALAXY overall was that a DEC salesman in Norway
had told a prospective customer (I believe it was the University of Oslo)
that TOPS-10 had a large number of features in its batch queuing system -
including all of the complex job scheduling that GALAXY attempted to
implement.  The story at the time was not that this was included in a
written contract, but had been given verbally to the representatives of the
University, and only after the contract was signed did DEC find out that the
verbal commitments were considered binding in Norway.  The result of not
having the functions was that DEC had to deliver a lot of extra hardware
(tape drives, and perhaps disk drives) to allow the job mix to run without
the manual scheduling until the functions were available.  The amount of
investment DEC had sitting in Oslo was supposedly one of the main reasons
why there was such a push to get GALAXY shipping, even though the first
field test release wouldn't stay running for 24 hours.

During the period I was in the monitor group (1969-1974) I was "Mr. Magtape". 
When I was with Honeywell I had worked extensively with their tape 
controllers and drives, which at that point in time were considered the best 
in the industry. DEC had hired Dick "Doc" Lawrence from Honeywell to help 
improve their magtape products, and Doc and I worked closely to improve the 
monitor's magtape service. We fought an uphill battle with the product line 
people, trying to get them to get serious about offering a decent tape 
system. I recall at one point writing a memo to just about everyone I could 
think of saying the best thing we could do for our customers who were 
complaining about the PDP-10's tape systems was to give them STC's phone 
number. I was told later that this memo lead to DEC's acquiring STC drives.

We also knew that tape labeling was important to our "data processing" 
customers. I acquired a copy of the ANSI standard (was it 3.27?) and studied 
it thoroughly. DEC made a deal with Emory University for some free hardware 
in exchange for design work on a tape labeling system. I spent a week in 
Atlanta meeting with Rob Warnock (who I believe later became somewhat famous 
as a hardware designer in Silicon Valley) going over his work and coming up 
with a design for the implementation of tape labeing. This was in August, 
1974. When I returned to Marlboro with the design, I found a message from 
First Data Corporation. Turns out they wanted to offer me a job.

At that time I was working on TAPSER, a total replacement for MTXSER, which I 
had also written. It was a project I had been trying to get DEC to commit to 
for some time. I turned FDC down by telling them I wanted $20K to leave DEC, 
a figure I thought was totally rediculous (1974 dollars). They came back a 
week later with the $20K, an "offer I couldn't refuse". So I left DEC, Ted 
Hess and Len Bosack took over the TAPSER project, and I believe Chuck O'Toole 
implemented tape labelling as part of the GALAXY project. I have no idea how 
much the work Rob and I did in Atlanta influenced the design. Chuck?

Of course, when that was going on, the rest of us had programmed the
front end (dc76) to play adventure while we were waiting for a stable
monitor to get booted...

And Olson was just echoing, perhaps unknowingly, the words of someone
higher up in the OS food chain at the time:

"Operating System/360 is hailed by its builders as the finest ever built,
because it indisputably has the most function. [...] On the other hand,
the Time-Sharing System for the PDP-10 is hailed by its builders as the
finest, because of its simplicity and the spareness of its concepts. By
any measure, however, its function is not even in the same class as that
of OS/360".

    - Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., known as the "father of the IBM System/
      360", in _The Mythical Man Month_, Addison-Wesley, c1972, 1975.

Mature systems are high-functioning but complex, and are often lacking
in beauty compared to newer designs, which can be planned from the outset
to seamlessly accommodate features which had to be painstakingly added
to their predecessors.
