   Your memory is correct, but only for the KA. "Fast Memory" was not
switchable in KIs and later. On a KA with the FM (No, not _that_ FM)
switched off, the ACs, indeed, were in core. There was a penalty in
performance, of course. As far as I'm aware, FM was a _very_ popular
option in the KA and not too many shipped without it.

   For devices which didn't support READIN-mode, you pretty much had
to enter the bootstrap from the panel. However, most devices tended
to be compatible with the READIN convention.

The KA which Chris used (#101) once had an intermittent in the FM ENB switch,
causing the hardware ACs to be randomly switched in and out as the margin
check/maintenance panel vibrated (or was tapped by the field servant).


When the Computer Museum was selling off PDP-6 boards at the MR cafeteria
garage sale, I asked Gordon if read-in mode was implemented as a diode matrix,
and if so, could he direct me to that board.  He said it wasn't, and that I
really wanted an AR/MQ/MB/lamp driver(Memory Indicator?) S6205K arithmetic
register bit slice instead.
