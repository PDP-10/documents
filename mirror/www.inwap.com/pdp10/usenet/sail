For most of the time that I was at SAIL, there was a [NET,GUE] login for
Network Guests, with no password.  I think files written in its directory
were deleted on logout, but otherwise it could do anything a local user
could do, until we started having malicious-user troubles.  Then Ralph Gorin
changed the file permission categories from the standard user-project-other
to user-known-guest, i.e., a category for everyone other than GUE and a
separate category for GUE.  (Okay, I lied, it was never user-project-other.
We used the "project" half of the PPN as a sort of cheap SFD feature before
DEC invented SFDs, so the three categories were same PPN, same programmer,
other.)  The standard file protection allowed guests read access and
everyone else read-write access.

I got a free ice cream sundae out of this because after changing the file
protection categories Ralph said something along the lines of "Now we're safe
from malicious guests" and I bet him I could find a dozen ways that guests
could still break into other accounts.  The reason I won the bet is that WAITS
was *not* very security-conscious; there was, for example, a UUO that put your
program in "IOT-User" mode, in which it was allowed to do hardware I/O
instructions.  The purpose was to allow the robotics people to hack together
hardware they could run directly, without having to write monitor support,
but you could use it to read passwords off the disk.  (That's right, they
weren't encrypted.)

We could, of course, disallow that one for guests, but we couldn't disallow
the one that let you have the monitor as your upper segment, because the WHO
program (sorta like systat) used it to gather its information.

As for account authorization, all you had to do to create an account was log
in under that PPN from a machine in the building.  (Which was unlocked most
of the time, by the way.  But it was off of the main campus, so you had to
make a special trip to be a malicious user in that way.  :-)  It's true that
if we had no idea who you were, the account would eventually get turned off.
But we were quite loose about letting random people wander in and start
writing programs, many of which turned out to be useful.

And you could set up your account with a remote-only password, so that if
you were in the building you didn't need your password to log in.  We did
require a password for remote login, though, except for GUE.  And I think
I'm vaguely remembering that eventually GUE was turned off altogether.

That was an amazing building:  it looked like a flying saucer that had
landed off Arastradero Road and never managed to take off again.  As I
recall they had named many of the rooms after places in the Tolkein
stories: "The Prancing Pony", etc.  The PDP10 was hooked up to a
vending machine filled with tasty Chinese snacks (from The Little
Restaurant in Menlo park, if I recall correctly), so you could charge
food to your account, and also bet the machine "double or nothing".
There was a lot at SAIL that was ahead of its time: multi-window
screens, an interface to a TV camera and TV feeds, and one of the
first Xerox laser printers which I recall being about the size of a
small elephant.  You could also type some combination of characters
and "map" your screen and keyboard onto someone else's, enabling a
kind of collaborative working.

Change sevens to noughts for e-mail.

And if you were over 21 it would sell you beer.  (Most things in the machine
could be bought with cash, but that one row couldn't; I think it was done by
setting the price to something other than a multiple of 5 cents.)

(Of course the over-21 thing didn't make the operation legal; we weren't
licensed to sell anything, let alone beer.)

Oh, and one out of 128 times you got your order free even without asking
for double or nothing.  And one row of the machine just had coins in it,
for use in the non-computerized vending machines.  I think that may have
been the first ATM!

The huge one wasn't a laser printer; it was an XGP (Xerox Graphics Printer),
originally designed as one side of a really expensive fax.  It was like a
laser printer in that it was digitally driven photocopier, but instead of a
laser it actually used a cathode ray tube that was scanned.  It was a huge
CRT, of which they only used a little strip in the middle, to avoid
curvature and parallax problems.  MIT-AI had one, too, and a couple of
other places.  The resolution was 200 dots/inch; the difference between that
and the early laser printer 300 dots/inch was very dramatic; all the XGP
serif fonts looked pretty jagged.  I scanned in a sample of Baskerville font,
my favorite, and spent a couple of months tweaking it.  The result was
readable, and fairly nice-looking, but I'm sure John Baskerville was rolling
in his grave.  (A few years ago I discovered that and some other XGP fonts
on a diskette sold by some company that distributed free/shareware software
for PCs.)

The Data Disk video generator provided 32 channels of digital video; one was
for the terminals not in use, and the other 31 were available for users.
There were about twice that many terminal screens connected to the video
switch, so only half could be used at a time.  (Less, in practice, because
eventually the disk that held the images developed bad spots, so some
channels were unreadable.  If you were really desperate you could ask for
one of those normally-unused channels by typing ESC-!, or you could put
yourself in a queue of people waiting for the good channels with ESC-CALL.)
(ESC and CALL were two of the non-ASCII extra keys on the SAIL keyboards;
the ASCII-ish code you thought I meant by ESC was labelled ALT on the
keyboards, but generated 0175, not 033, which was not-equal in the SAIL
character set.  :-)  The video switch could connect you to any of the Data
Disk channels, or could OR several of them together, or could instead
connect you to analog signals including the TV camera on the robot cart
that drove around the parking lot as well as a couple of broadcast TV
channels.  (There was an audio switch, too, so you could get the TV picture
and sound together.  The monitors we used had high-persistence phosphor to
reduce flicker, so watching TV was a little weird, like having ghosts.)
A particularly nice feature was that you could ask to watch TV until your
program finishes running, and then be switched back to your TTY display
automatically.

The keyboards that went with the monitors were entirely separate devices.
You could be typing at one virtual terminal while watching a different one.
So on the input end of things there was the mapping
	keyboard N ---------- virtual TTY M
and on the output end there were two mappings
	screen N ----- Data Disk channel K ----- virtual TTY J
and there were a slew of keyboard ESC commands to rearrange any of
those mappings.  In retrospect I'm amazed we could remember them all,
but it seemed easy at the time!  (Yes, you could ask to map your screen
and/or your keyboard to someone else's TTY; that's another way in which
I wouldn't exactly call WAITS security-minded.  You could also ask to
Hide your TTY (ESC H); this disabled other people from using the ordinary
ESC 42 M to map their keyboard/screen to TTY42, if that was yours and
hidden, or ESC [ BH ] to map to whatever TTY is in use by programmer name
BH (the right half of the PPN), if hidden.  But they could still type
CONTROL-META-TOP-UNSHIFT-BREAK 42 M, or C-M-T-U-B [ BH ], to override
the hiding.  For a while this "magic" escape character was known only to
system hackers, but at one point an insurrection among the users led to
it becoming public.)

No, I didn't still remember the magic character; I'm reading the Monitor
Command Manual as I type this.  :-)

The monitor's display server let you partition the screen into "pieces of
paper" and "pieces of glass," two styles of window, the first of which
scrolled the text.  This was one of the earliest window systems, and since
several of our graduate students went to work at Xerox PARC and then at
Apple, it was a direct ancestor of the Mac windows interface that later
took over the world.

Well I could go on forever but I guess I shouldn't...  :-)

NET,GUE was turned off no later than the summer of '76.  So, it was
already off by the time you came back from IRCAM.

The camera was a great source of all ones, so it was easy with IOT user to
instruct the camera to write into a single word...which happened to be the
address of your privilege word.

There were a few zillion other ways.  Some, but not all, were closed.

One of the ones you guys got was the ability to start an unlogged-in
phantom, which could do a LOGIN UUO, which in turn took the job's new
privileges as one of its arguments.

One of the ones you guys never got was the easy way to get someone else's
password.  Open the victim's UFD as a file.  16 words of the JOBDAT held
DDB pointers, indexed by I/O channel number.  The directory's password was
stored in the DDB, so it was a simple matter to do a PEEK UUO to get it.

Unless you were in "monitor mode" (supposed to be a little more like a
conventional user interface such as TOPS-10), then, yes.  Many users
would mix commands like :DELETE (a file) and ^F (list a directory).

If you gave the command :MONMODE (or someone put that into your login
init file for you), then DDT would prompt with a colon and expect
colon commands like :LISTF.  The :DDTMOD command put you back into
normal mode.  If you were in "monitor mode" and typed a rubout at the
prompt, I think it would let you enter one control-character command.

Logging in with the :LOGIN CSTACY command did not put you into monitor mode.
Logging in with CSTACY$U was the same as :LOGIN, but put a zero value
into the CLOBRF and MORWARN variables.  Note that either way, the
default for DELWARN was to be verbose, CONFRM is on, and so on.

 JD> Wasn't WAITS (the Stanford Tops10) a bit more into security?

Well, WAITS of course started with TOPS-10 security.  Maybe some SAIL
people (MRC? BH?) will be able to comment on how it was modified, but 
it certainly had user accounts. I have heard that it was not too unusual
for DEC customers to modify TOPS-10 policies about how PPNs worked.
WAITS may have had some interesting things going on with that, though.
I would like to hear more things about WAITS in general.

ITS was an original system; it was not a version of TOPS-10 or
anything else.  I don't know of any other general purpose
timesharing systems besides ITS that eschewed security.

Wasn't that [being first on the backup\pukcab\failsa tapes]

was likeliest to be retrievable.  I was always afraid

My memory of those tape drives has faded somewhat,
but I do recall that they consumed tapes.  At one point
I wrote the monitor sources on paper tape so I
would have a reliable backup.  I think I was trying
to impress management with the need for a good
backup device.

Thank you, Brian.  I guess the tape drive worked
after all.

At C-MU, computer accounts before the PDP-10 showed up were things
like S600EW13 (S for science, 600 for course number "Computer
Programming and Problem Solving I), EW for me, 13 because I was the
13th EW to come along.  (Being born on Friday the 13th had nothing to
do with it.)  The last character could be alphabetic, so the "man
number" could have 26 * 26 * 10 * 36 permutations, or 243,360.  2^18 =
262,144.

So one of my first programming jobs was to teach TOPS-10 about  C-MU
account numbers....

The A-Z places counts as 0-25, 0-9 count as 0-9, and 0-Z (A-9?) count
as 0-35.

The "project" part was easy: S600 = 18 * 1000 + 6 * 100 + 0 * 10 + 0 * 1,
lots of room.  The "programmer"/"Man number" for EW13 went like:

EW13 = (4 * 26 * 10 * 36) + (22 * 10 * 36) + (1 * 36) + 3  or the CPU friendly
EW13 = ( 4 * 26 + 22) * 10 + 1) * 36) +  3  and the highest one is
ZZ9Z = (25 * 26 + 25) * 10 + 9) * 36) + 35

The A-Z places counts as 0-25, 0-9 count as 0-9, and 0-Z (A-9?) count
as 0-35.
