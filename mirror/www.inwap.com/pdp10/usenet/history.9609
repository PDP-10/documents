BBN turned off its last KL this week.
The 1st KA machine arrived in '68 or '69, we forgotten exactly when,
and was used for Tenex development.

About 27 years, running 10/50, then Tenex, then TOPS20.  Plus running
the Gov't-owned Prophet TOPS10/SMP for a few years.

Cheers

It was published in a long time ago, back before Tenex. 
Here are some citations:

Peter J Denning, "Virtual Memory" ACM Computing Surveys 2,  No 2, 
March-April p 111-114

Denning and Tichy, 1991, "Operating Systems," in _Encyclopedia of
Computer Science_ Van Norstrand Reinhold

Denning, "Working sets, past and present" IEEE Transactions on
Software Engineering SE-6, No 1 (January) p 64-84

 It was also described in several texts on
operating systems, including Denning's.

I never, personally, saw the proof that is is optimal, but when I was
studying Operating Systems with Denning, he talked about it. He said
that a few years after his work, another paper compared the emperical
results using working sets against a theoritical optimal system that
knew what pages would be needed, and in what order. The paper showed
that you could get very close to the impossible "theoritical optimal"
(about 4% worse) using proper working set tuning. I could find the
cite, by asking Peter, if there is lots of interest.

The LRU approach that way too many systems use is not close to
optimal, and requires far too much manual tuning to get even decent
balance. I haven't seen a lot of detail for other OS approaches, but I
spent far too much time understanding VMS'. bletch. 

What is truely sad is that Denning's virtual memory had a great 
track record on Tenex/Tops-20 systems, yet Cutler and the PDP-11
folks paid no attention to it when they built the Vax. Worse still,
IMHO, is that he apparently didn't even do it right on NT. I can
forgive a mistake that is nearly 20 years old, but someone should have
learned in the years since.

One of the things that amazed me when I was a graduate teaching
assistant for Denning's Operating Systems class was that of the
students, that hadn't been completely mindzapped thinking that MS-DOS
was the only operating system, could not even imagine that with
working sets, the system tunes the sizes automatically rather than
requiring a sys-admin to set quotas and limits.

LOTS stood for "Low Overhead TimeSharing", which referred to the
staffing, not the quality of service.  It was founded in the late 70's
by Ralph Gorin (now of XKL?) and John McCarthy.  Ralph served as its
first full-time manager.  FTE staff was 3.5 when I was there (.5 time
Director, FT manager, FT systems programmer, FT administrative
assistant), with loads of help provided by students and other Stanford
facilities.

LOTS ran Stanford-modified TOPS-20 (on a 2040, at first, which was
upgraded to a 2050 and augmented by a 2050 in 1981-2).  Typical heavy
user load on each machine was in the neighborhood of 100-120 users.

We had a user community of about 6,000 total.  It was a fun place to work.

Bob
ex-LOTS manager, 1981-1984

    What operating system ran LOTS at Stanford?  One of our crew claims it 
    was a custom O/S that could support thousands of users on a single -10 or 
    -20.  Another says it was a pretty vanilla TOPS-20 system.  (I can't 
    believe it could support over 100 users in that case.)

At it's peak, LOTS was *THREE* pretty vanilla TOPS-20 systems (w/CFS), a
backup/devlopment machine, and a Systems Concept SC-30M.  "Pretty vanilla"
is relative, Stanford being one of the sites that did a fair amount of
monitor, exec, and utility development, but a lot of those were general
enough to get folded back in by DEC (eventually), and there wasn't anything
that would stop anyone from calling it tops20.  I don't think it ever hit
1000 simultaneous users (for the cluster), but it certainly got up to "too
many"...

There was a vax or two and an IBM mini-mainframe, too, but they didn't
really count.

Sadly, the LOTS (Low Overhead Timesharing, where you get students and
volunteers to do a lot of the work that is normally necessary to support
a mainframe computer facility) philosophy gave way to the "microcomputers
need no support at all" philosophy, and any interesting applications or
systems modifications that might get developed simply dissappear when
the next student boots the machine, instead of surviving for all.
(And of course, the size of the organization supporting the "no support"
computers is much larger than the size of the old LOTS stafff :-)

A fair number of the last of the LOTS crew ended up at XKL, and I suspect
that Rich, at least, will say more.  I was merely on the periphery
(occasionally using the development machine for development.)

(If Tim Shoppa hadn't replied to your question, I would have never seen
it; this software often skips messages and I haven't determined why.)

Paper tape was very clumsy to use.  I will tell  you how Digital used to
do their development cycles on the smaller machines (read that not
PDP-10s; they did things the right way [smiley face here showing its
prejudice).  A programmer would code by writing on coding paper.  He
(there were no shes) would then submit the hand-written code to Tape Prep.
 Tape Prep would then type it off-line on a KSR-35 transferring the
hand-written to oil paper tape.  Now note that this oil paper tape (when
the typing job was finished) could be 50-100' long.  The tape was then
read on the KSR-35 reader, producing a listing which could be proofed. 
Errors were marked up and edited (use your imagination about how one goes
about editing a 50' oiled paper tape).  When all edits were made and the
paper tape reflected what the programmer wanted,  the oil paper tape was
then copied to fan-fold.  If the programmer wanted an assembly done, this
fan-fold paper tape was taken to System 40 (a PDP-10, remember that
system, guys?), read in with the paper tape reader to disk [sigh,
finally].  Then the code was assembled with all its errors, a listing
produced, etc. with the appropriate cross-assembler.  If the programmer
wanted his stuff on DECtape (the best media ever invented in the whole
wide world), it was copied using FILEX.

B.T.W., when I got in charge of the RUNOFF group in Tape Prep.  Those
KSR-35 procedures became history fast.  Everyone got their own PPN and
everything was entered on-line.  If the programmer wanted a paper tape, we
produced one, but it was a rare request.  Everybody wanted stuff on
DECtape.

Now, if you had a 50' paper tape, and you dropped it, it was a mess. 
Reading 50' of fanfold in the -10's paper tape reader was an art that
required acrobatic skills. I would have much rather handled cards.

There actually were some she type programmers around. From memory, Martha 
Sifnas, Evelyn Dow, Margaret Palmer, Arundati Badrenath (spelling may not be 
correct, but she worked on TSS-8), and many others whose faces I remember but 
whose names are gone. I'm assuming we're talking pre-1970 here. Several of 
the above were already at DEC when I joined in 1966.

Ah! I had forgotten that trick!  Also, if you didn't disturb the cards
that had fallen, one could pick them up such that the original order was
preserved.  There were only a few that had to be inserted.  Now, if you
dropped a paper tape (especially the oil tape) it would fly down the
hallway into nooks and crannies of the old mill.  While one was trying to
pick it up (we ususally emptied a waste paper basket and just dumped the
tape into it) some people or machine would come along and kick it aside,
stomp on it, etc.  It was just another flotsam and jetsam in the mill. 
Tapes usually didn't survive an encounter with one of those motorized

Actually, it was FILE op,id,file.ext,...  The id allowed the operator
to pick your tape from the rack.  op could be C (check queue,) D (delete
file from tape,) L (create a file with a tape directory,) R (recall a
file from tape,) F (file a file to tape,) W (wait for pending requests
to complete,) and Z (zero tape directory and then same as F.)  Since disks
were small, you often kept both programs and data on DECtapes.  The above
command allowed a batch job to request the files it needed and put them
back thus avoiding disk usage charges if it finished before the system
job which calculated disk usage ran.

Ah, those were the days.

I have been called to task about my reference that there weren't any women
programmers in those days.  I know there were female programmers (3) in
the TOPS10 group.  I made the statement from my memory of Tape Prep work
back then.  I don't think we did very much work for female programmers. 
The only women I really remember (that means I saw them come into the
rooms more than once/year) were the writers.  My apologies to the female
programmers who existed back then (I had the ability myself...just didn't
get paid for it) [smiley face here].

I have also been questioned about my reference to KSR35s with the
suggestion that maybe I meant ASR35 or, more likely, ASR33s.  I know that
they weren't 33s; those things broke if you type faster than 30 w.p.m.  I
was banned from using them at W.M.U. by DEC's field service after I broke
them many times.
These machines that we used in Tape Prep had a huge footprint (more than
double the footprint of the 35s used as CTYs on a PDP10.  These machines
had a paper tape punch and a paper tape reader.  They punched oil tape
that was on a roll about 8" in diameter.  I don't remember them being
referred to as ASR35s.  Note that I never saw these flavors of TTYs
anywhere else other than Tape Prep.

The Teletypes(tm) that Tape Prep used were ASR-35s (Automatic Send/Receive). 
Most of the PDP-10 CTYs were KSR-35s (Keyboard Send/Receive), but I do recall 
that occasionally an ASR would appear as a CTY. Remember the aborted attempt 
to use the KSR-37 as a CTY? At 150 baud they were certainly faster, and with 
upper/lower case somewhat sexier, but alas they proved fatally flawed by 
their unreliability.

well the system is optimized for them:

late 1971 - MUX/leased line cuts down number of local modems,  user numbers
slowly rise above theoretical maximum of 72, though peak time loads are
reduced by greater accessability to terminals by students. Swapping disk
added.

1972 - More lines, more MUX'es +2 RP-02s, Still topping out at 95% system
reasources used despite an outrageous number of insane jobs. No real waiting
except for folks getting frustrated with ASR-33s. All are now versed in the
"major" ASR-33 repairs which can be made with 1 paper clip, 2-4 rubber bands
and Scotch Magic Mending Tape.

1973 - late - 256Kwrd core box arrives, along with a 9-track magtape.
Decwriters and Hazeltine 2000 series terminals begin to replace ASR-33s at
many lcoations. More modems running at Bell 212 standards. Still no overload.

1974-6 the single-CPU KA-10 maxes out, but despite jobs ranging from mammoth
macro programs running under DDT, folks attempting to calculate "full"
fibbonacci sequence with BASIC brute force programs,  programming in TECO,
interpreters like CRYPTC <Bruce Maier's utter free-form language (take that,
oh ye of little faith who feel thee must declarest all variables>, system
performance is still good. 120+ terminals logged on at a time.

It worked. It worked well.

    128 words / sector
    10 sectors / track
    20 tracks / cylinder
    203 cylinders / disk

Looks like 5,196,800 Engineer's Words to me;
5,196,800 / 1024 / 1024 = 4.956+ M Programmer's Words.

RP01 was 10 sectors / track, 10 tracks / cylinder or 1/4 size of RP02.
3 RP01s were put on #2 and 5 shipped to a customer. We convinced
Memorex to take them all back even though they were in Digital
magenta and pea green colors.

It's not often that I can speak from a position of absolute
authority. Thanks for giving me the opportunity.

I think it was certainly more than that.

I have in front of me the 1978-79 PDP-11 Peripherals Handbook.  While the
numbers it gives are in terms of 8-bit bytes (since most drives were
formatted for 16 bit words for 11s), the capacities for 18-bit formatting
would probably be a bit higher, but still in the ballpark.

Here are the capacities (in mbytes) for various DEC drives that were also
connectable to systems whose word lengths divide by 6 rather than 8,
according to this book:

RL01     Rem. cartridge    1           5.2      55 ms     512KB/sec   2400

RA60     Rem. disk pack    5         205        50        1.98MB/sec  3600
RA81     Fixed Winchester  4         456        36.3      2.2MB/sec   3600

* 1.3 MB/sec in brain-dead VAX mode; RP07-D (for 36-bits) did 2.2MB/sec. 
One of the fastest drives Digital sold during the 36-bit era; not matched
until the RA81.  Of course, the RA81's speed was mitigated by all the
extra latency added by going through an HSC.

I don't have any info on the RP20, nor the RP02 or RP03.

Yup.  I remember those days quite well, given that I was a LOTS user from
1977 when I joined the Stanford staff until the time when the plug was
finally pulled on the SC-30M.

You answered your question.  You only had 256KW of memory.  Even in the
early days, the operating system and its data structures were pretty close
to 256K (about 128K or so of which needed to be resident).  We're talking
*major* thrash opportunity here.  DEC once sold 128K machines as bottom of
the line systems, but those were completely unusable and eventually even
the OS punted on trying to support them.

You can especially see this on a 2020.  A 256KW 2020 is slow; a 512KW 2020
makes a nice single-user machine.

Of course, if you had CS types running lots of TeX and (shudder!) LISP
jobs, you really needed a 4MW machine...

The PDP-11 did not do swapping.  The PDP-11 handled the terminals.

Many new to the 36 bit world are unaware that those of us who built TOPS-10 
are offended by lumping TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 together and calling them Tops. 
Even some DEC people late in the life of the 36 bit product line were 
starting to practice this sacrilege. Of course this is somewhat amusing given 
the general revulsion when David Stone announced at a Monitor Group meeting 
one day that the PDP-10 Monitor would henceforth be called TOPS-10. We just 
HATED the name.

We were similarly unimpressed when DEC decided on TOPS-20 for Dan Murphy's 
operating system. What was wrong with TENEX,...or VIROS,...or SNARK?

I worked in PDP-10 Engineering for 2 years starting JUN68. TOPS-10 was small in
those days. The development machine, KA10 #2, had 32KW. One day in '69
several engineers went to the cafeteria just before 1PM and joined several
programmers who were already in a lunchroom discussion.

One programmer said, "Here's a few users. Let's ask them." He then described a
new feature they had just put in the OS. We said it sounds good, what's the
issue? We were told it takes 3 words of resident core. In '69 this was suitable
for lunchroom discussion.

Some of you remember W102s were hard to come by. The development team wanted a
third bank of memory on #2. Manufacturing had lots of core stacks but no W102s.
Tom Eggers noticed the two banks of memory on #2 each had 3 memory ports
populated with W102s. Only 2 ports were being used. They got a third memory bank
sans W102s from manufacturing, populated two ports, and upgraded #2 to 48KW WITH
NO ADDITIONAL USERS. Needless to say the OS started growing.

The previous LOTS discussion pointed out that it wasn't long before TOPS-20
wouldn't boot on 128K:

I remember when the KA10 at Harvard got a third bank in 1972 and user space
went to 31 KW -- we were doing a project in a LISPoidal extensible language
system called ECL, and we finally had enough space to complete the project.
48 KW total -- what a luxury!

Also, if memory serves, in 1970 I remember swapping to DECtape (problems with
the Vermont Research drum).

The RP02 was a clone of the IBM 2314, the RP03 was a double-density version
of that, and the RP04 was a clone of the IBM 3330.  The approximate capacities
were 20 MB, 40 MB, and 80 MB.  For example, an RP02 had 40,600 sectors of
128 36-bit words or about 5 megawords.  An RP04 had 156,180 sectors of
the same size or a bit short of 20 megawords.  These figures are from the
source code of ITS, a pdp-10 operating system that supports all those disks,
examined by Emacs running on ITS.

I don't know anything about RP20.

If it's true, then IBM used the same drives more efficiently:
2314 = 29 MB = 200 cyl (+ 3 spares) x 20 tracks x  7294 bytes
3330 = 100MB = 411 cyl              x 19 tracks x 13030 bytes

  I remember doing that but it got uncomfortable when you exhaled :)

  I'm impressed with the number of former pdp10/tops10 folks still
  active (alive) who worked in MR01 and write to this newsgroup.

  So test your memory: can you name (meaning serial #s, ie. 1026) all
  the 36-bit systems that were fixtures in the mr01-2 "LCG" lab ? 
  I think I can but will wait to post it.

Sigh.  Does no one remember our beloved System 40/2?  System 2 was taken
from hardware engineering when they moved on to faster machines and became
the second processor for a dual KA system for the TOPS10 Monitor Group. 
It would run the red packs when all TOPS10 systems were up and available
for timesharing.  

I'm really sorry that messages to this newsgroup aren't kept on-line
longer.  I feel I've missed a bunch of them since this thread was started

As a student at Dundee University in 1981 we had a DEC-10 connected via
ANF-10 to several other machines including a DEC-10 at Edinburgh University.
At one point Dundee University upgraded to (and my version number
memory is hazy now but roughly) TOPS-10 7 something while Edinburgh were
still at 6 something. Previously TOPS-10 had attempted to assign all DN87(?)
lines to itself and leave them connected but now Dundee would disconnect
them at the end of a session ("HOST SENT DISCONNECT") and they would be grabbed by
Edinburgh. Result was that hundreds of network unware students would find
themselves fruitlessly trying to login to a machine 50 miles away at the end of a
low speed link. Eventually Dundee patched the DN87 code to prevent it from
attaching terminals to anything other than their own machines.

RADIX50 preceded the PDP-11 by a long time.  It was used on the PDP-10 (and I
think the PDP-6), where it allowed packing 6-character symbol names into the
rightmost 32 bits of a 36-bit word, with the other 4 bits used for flags to the
linker.

I also don't think it was a DEC invention; I seem to remember that it was first
devised by J. A. N. Lee for the FORTRAN compiler on the IBM 704, another 36-bit
machine.

The Arpanet File Transfer Protocol supported five "representation types":
	TYPE A	ASCII
	TYPE I	image
	TYPE L	local byte
	TYPE P	print file
	TYPE E	EBCDIC
The first two of these are still in widespread use; most FTP programs
have "ascii" and "image" commands.  For this discussion, what you have
to understand is the difference between types I and L.

Sending text was straightforward unless you were talking to an IBM machine.
You used TYPE A, which implied an 8-bit byte sent over the net.  If you
were a PDP-10, you converted to/from a 7-bit byte for the local file,
packed in the usual five-per-word way.

Sending binary files was more problematic.  Type I, image type, requires
that the bits be tightly packed at both sending and receiving ends of the
transfer.  So, for example, if you send a 36-bit PDP-10 word to an 8-bit
machine, the latter machine must put the first 32 bits into four bytes, and
then the fifth byte of the destination file will contain the last four bits
of the first word and the first four bits of the second word!  Image type was
intended for two similar machines, not for dissimilar ones.

Type L, local byte type, to the rescue.  It allows each end of the
transfer to arrange the bit stream into bytes in a convenient way
for its particular architecture.  In particular, it allows 36-bit
machines and 8-bit machines to communicate by using only 32 bits
out of each PDP-10 word, supposing that you say TYPE L and BYTE 8
or BYTE 32.  (If you say TYPE L and BYTE 36, then you are using all
of the PDP-10 word, and telling the 8-bit end to use five bytes
for each PDP-10 word, or telling a 32-bit machine to use two of its
words for each PDP-10 word.)

There was never a TENEX type in the FTP spec.  8-bit Unix machines
had an FTP client program that accepted a TENEX command, which
caused it to send TYPE L and (I believe) BYTE 8.  It was called
TENEX rather than PDP-10 because that FTP program was written at
a time when TOPS-10 didn't yet have virtual memory, and TOPS-20
didn't exist (that is, DEC hadn't yet bought TENEX from BBN), and
so almost all the PDP-10s on the Arpanet were running TENEX.

See NIC 14333 for full info on the File Transfer Protocol at the
relevant time.

    The first I ever heard of "TENEX" was when Murphy started to take the KIs
    stand-alone to work on the OS that was would be sold as TOPS20.  Is there
    a connection between Murphy's TENEX and the "TENEX mode" that you
    described as an Unixism?

Yes.  TENEX was a paging OS for PDP-10s developed by BBN.  With extensive
hacking by DEC, it became tops-20, eventually.  I'm surprised that the unix
ftp command turned out to be "tenex" - by the time this became a widely
useful command (about the time WSMR put the entire CPM shareware libraries
on line at Simtel-20 (1980?)), tops20 existed and was pretty well
entrenched.  Certainly by the time the net converted to TCP (1983) , TENEX
was no longer the dominant operating system for PDP-10 architecture
computers on the internet.

We are going into the wayback machine here...  

I *think* that the reason that this idea didn't fly when we first
thought about it (the quest for less powerhungry disk having been 
a long and ongoing saga) goes like this...

The KS10 uses the RH11C version of the traditional RH11 massbuss 
controller.  This is meaningful because it does not do 16 bits+2 parity,
but instead does 18 bits + no parity.  Being a 36 bit machine, 18 is good,
16 is bad.  The RM03 and RP06 (and RP07 and RM80) were able to fake this
18bit world as well, though some of them (RP07?) needed to have special
HDAs.  Man, all of this is fuzzy now...

So, what you might have luck doing is taking the mass buss adapter out 
of an RM03 and hooking the 2322 or other fuji spinning storage up to 
that; I am not sure if they did funny things to the device IDs although
I get a feeling now that I think on it that they did...  There was some 
issue with the number of sectors, etc. too.   I think that after the 
MBA in the drive is the closest that things come to being "standard" in 
this chain of events, and thus the easiest to fake it, but your mileage
may vary, as they say.  

If you really want to have fun, now that RAM prices are getting so low
you could build a ramdisk for it and really let it fly ;-)  Of course,
going from 2901 to 29203 super-slice bit slice processors might also help
things, but then we are into microcode hackery and we have lives now, and 
dave moon no doubt has other things to do...  Reality intrudes.

One thing that MIGHT have more promise is to realize exactly how low
performance those ooriginal drives were, and see if you could take a 
machine, say a unix box or whatever weapon you feel you wield the best,
and put that disk channel onto a parallel port on that thing (if you can 
get a port that will do 18 bits ;-) and write some tight code that will 
see the requests come down the line, and go fetch the right thing from 
disk.  With even general purpose machines flying at mach 6 these days, 
might one of them be able to perform the tasks that we used to have to 
do with really specialized hardware playing smart disk controllers?
That way, you can put disk on the machine at a price of a grand per 
gig or even MUCH less.

Doug

Status: RO

Shawn mentioned the need for a Massbus to SCSI adapter.  There's a
company in Florida that makes an anything to anything adapter, and they've
put together a Massbus to SCSI version for DEC, which they package with
a read/write optical drive and call the RM06 or RP12.  The only problem is
it's VERY expensive.  There are two questions I haven't asked yet -- first
is, is it too fast to use with a KS-10, and second is, is there an off-
the-shelf 18 bit version, or only 16 bits.  The following info (from Bob
Welzel of DEC, who has very kindly been helping with getting info on the
Alpha and KL microcode for use with our KL-emulator-to-run-on-an-Alpha
project -- I'll post something on this soon) implies that there *would*
be some changes required:

I'm appending the info on the RM06 given me by from our local DEC sales rep.
I haven't really pursued this because an entire Alpha would be cheaper...
One thing that might be interesting to look into is whether one might buy
the interface alone, and plug some other SCSI drive into it.

First, my credentials - I ported TOPS-10 to the KS-10 over the winter of 
1977-78, and wrote the disk service routine for the UBA (Unibus Adaptor) 
interfaced RM03 and RP06.  I see no reason any Unibus device can't be made to 
work with the KS-10. Just a small matter of programming. Are you planning on 
running TOPS-10 or TOPS-20 on your KS? Getting TOPS-20 to work with a new 
controller would be easier (assuming you have access to the sources) because 
of the page-only I/O. TOPS-10 would be more of a bear because of the way I/O 
can be split across discontinuous page boundaries, but at least the sources 
are more easily available. I seem to recall the key is to be found in a 
routine called "MAPIO" which may be located in FILIO (or perhaps in VMSER).

Oh yes, another potential problem just occured to me. You need some way to 
format the drives into 128 36-bit words. The RM03 and RP06 were set up to 
work in either PDP-11 or PDP-10 modes. If you have full RM02 emulation then 
this may be possible. I can't recall whether the RM02 had a 36-bit mode. The 
more I think about it the more I come up with potential problems, but can't 
think of any that are insurmountable. If you have specific questions don't 
hesitate to email me. I still have a warm spot in my heart for the KS.

Actually, I was planning to run ITS on this contraption. Big problem is that 
ITS really wants an RP06, instead of an RM03.

Some of the SCxx series controllers can emulate RP06's as well... Another 
reason to think emulator instead of rock-controller...

Formatting would have to be done in the controller, yep.

From my recollections, the RM02 was basically an RM03 that only spun at 2400 
RPM instead of 3600 RPM. With the lower bit-cell time, the RH11 controller 
could keep up. However it is true that the KS10 uses the RH11, but it had a 
clever hack (well kinda clever) called "Super Hog mode DMA" where the 
controller grabbed the UNibus for something like 32 clock cycles instead of 
4-8. Enough to keep up with the 3600RPM RM03.

Jesus, didn't these guys ever think of just buffering a whole track, instead 
of a piddly sector buffer...

Thanks for the offer of help though. I'll probably need it before I get this 
thing running. I do have a warm spot in my house for this Dec/20...

The Emulex SC1x series only know how to work in "16-bit" mode, and
don't work in "18-bit" mode.  I think they may fake a few 18-bit
operations to satisfy some of the PDP-11 diagnostics, but the 
structure on disk is 16-bit words only.

There are also considerations about the differences between "real"
Massbus device registers and the "emulated" Massbus device registers
on the Emulex SC1x-type interfaces.  For example, the SC1x series
works fine on a Unibus PDP-11 and looks like a Massbus device to the
OS, but it doesn't work right if you pop it into the Unibus of a
VAX 11/780.  This is because the Massbus adapter on a 11/780 doesn't
live at all in Unibus address space - the Massbus adapters hang differently
from the SBI (I believe the original terminology is that they are on
a different "nexus".)

On the other hand, RP's and RM's are very SMD-like inside.  There
are supposedly a few inverted signals to screw you over if you try
this, but you could replace, say, the RM03 drive with a 2322 and keep
the SMD-ish to massbus boards which are in the pedestal.  If you're
really interested in this option, I believe I have print sets for
both the DEC RM03 and the CDC drive it was based on (9762?  Serious
brain fade going on here.)

Didn't System Concepts make 18-bit SMD to Massbus adapters?  Or
was that (shudder) System Industries?

Very true, however that does not mean that one can't write a driver on a Vax 
to talk to a RH11 on a UBA. Just twiddle the registers, set the transfer 
address, and go...

Well, not that simple. If memory serves me right, the UBAs on the 11/780 were 
the slowest things in creation. Even slower than the UBA on the 11/70. With 
that slug speed, one could never use Hog mode, and would probably be limited 
to 2400 RPM RM02's unless one wanted to do some seriously bad sector 
interleaves.

The 20/20 could pull this stunt because the UBA was heavily buffered, and the 
RH11 (in Super Hog mode) was the only thing on the bus.

Side question: Did the MASSBUSS on the 11/70 live partially on the UBA? Just 
curious if one programmed it by twiddling the bits on the Unibus, and then 
sitting back while the 32Bit Massbuss Direct Cache//Memory interface sucked 
your data in like a hoover...

Hm... While the thought of the controllers sucking twice as much power as the 
HDA itself appeals to me, I'm not sure if this is the route I'd pursue off 
the bat. 

The big problem here is I'd have to use a HDA that precicely matched a RM02 
drive (what was it: 677 cyls, 5 heads, 30s/t?). Giving me a piddly 70Mb of 
disk space (well, those are 16 bit words). Per power sucking, noisy 
controller... Not too high a ROI...

But then there is the RM05. 256 Mb with a geometry that might be matchable. 
And if memory serves me right, one could connect 2 RM05's to each MASSBUSS 
controller. Though was the RM05 supported by TOPS/20? Or ITS? Doubt ITS, but 
perhaps T20.

Of course we COULD write a driver for the RM05.

Then again, we COULD just give up and hack a driver for the UDA50. Even if 
one stuffed 36 bits across 5 byte boundaries, the drives would be a lot 
bigger... Ah, but DEC doesn't tell you how to use the DSA specs, do they?

If you're going to write your own drivers, I'd just find a unused
parallel port (or build one) and hook up an IDE drive.  It'll require
a couple of chips of TTL in between, but the interface is trivial:
an IDE drive is just a set of registers.  Of course, any DMA support
would be up to you to design - most all IDE drives work through
programmed I/O on PC-clones.  No IDE drives that I know of support
non-8-bit words, but as long as you're working around the lack of DMA,
this is trivial in comparison.

That's exactly how it works.  All the drive and control registers appeared
on Unibus connectors in the Massbus slots.

The Fujitsu 2321 is a pretty good match for that.  You'd have to set
the sector length properly for 18-bit words, but that's absolutely
straightforward.

>But then there is the RM05. 256 Mb with a geometry that might be matchable. 

The hard part matching this will be finding a drive with a slow enough
data rate.  The more modern SMD drives of this capacity or bigger (in
particular the Fujitsu 2351A, 2361, 2333, 2334, 2344, etc.) which are
readily available on the surplus market have higher data rates.  You
could probably put in a Fujitsu 2284-series drive, and while this is
an improvement over a RM05, it's still a 150 pound 14-inch disk drive.
And they aren't as reliable as the later Fujitsu drives, so you're
less likely to find them in working condition.  They were late enough
that they had a lot of custom Fujitsu MSI chips in them, making repair
a bit more difficunt than the RM05-era drives.

RM05 have been interfaced to TOPS-20 KS-10.  I have seen it.
Peter Lothberg in Sweden, had it.  So the software hack is there.

RM80.  I have heard that RM80 (jumpered to 18-bit mode) will be usable
at least for ITS.  So the software hack for ITS is there.

No, I don't have any of these.  All I know is that making a Massbus adpater
takes a _lot_ of effort, lots of poorly documented signals, which have to
be timed accurately for the Massbus interface in the machine.

I seem to recall that when I did the TOPS-10 port I included RM05 support in 
the code even though it wasn't a standard option. Of course it never got 
tested but it seemed to be a reasonable thing to do while I was mucking about 
in the sources. This is from memory at a distance of nineteen years or so, so 
I may be mistaken.

I just looked through RPXKON and RHXKON, but all I saw were RP04/05/06, RM03,
and RP07 as available drive types.  Looks like it got lost somewhere along the
line.  This is in 7.04/7.05 sources.

I can confirm that Peter's RM05 code for TOPS-20 works; it's the obvious,
trivial addition to the sources.  I run it on my 2020.  I never tried
TOPS-10's RM05 support. 

The more nasty job is to format the RM05 for PDP-10s.  You need to add (or
was it cut?) a jumper in the controller to get 18-bit mode, and you need
to modify the formatting program (DDRPI, DSRMA, FORMAT, KSFORM) to handle
it.  Peter hacked up DSRMA to know about RM05s.

Then, too, if you don't have 3-phase power you need to rewrite the power
supply in the the RM05 to use the correct transformer tap for 240V instead
of 208V.  It'll run without you doing this....for a few months until the
power supply burns out...

I played it on a PDP-1 on the 25th anniversary celebration of Space War
at TCM.  I was at TCM last weekend.  Showroom indeed.  Pity.  I think I
should stop donating money to them.

Absolutely!  It's one of the best designed video games ever.  It also taught
some physics.  I have no patience for the see-how-fast-you-can-hit-fire
games.  I'm the only person I know who landed safely on his first try.

I haven't seen the TSS-8 game, but the author of the GT40 program, Jack
Burness, knew the key PDP-8 hackers at DEC then.  I didn't meet Jack
until years later at Alliant Computer where he had a contract to do some
graphics work.

Yeah, we had that working for a while.  I'm not convinced that the RM80
support for 18-bit mode really worked though.  It was often the case
that when you powered the drive up your data was gone.  We never figured
out exactly what the problem was, but I developed the superstition that
you were -more- likely to lose if you powered the drive up when it was
write-protected (you read that right).

To answer a question someone else asked: yes it was Systems Concepts
that
marketed a box that emulated RP06's and RP07's.  We almost got one at
MIT
to keep our ITS machines running when our RP06's became unmaintainable.
It was rather pricey as I recall...

There is actually a SCSI controller and disk for (among other
machines) the KS-10.  It will emulate a RP06, complete with
Massbus contacts!   Yes, it will do 18 or 16 bit.  And, if someone
hacks the monitor code a little, to allow larger disks than the 
standard RP06, the controller can have maybe 2 or more GB of SCSI....

Now, this has a serious drawback:  Price!  DEC lists it at some
US $ 14.000 (fourteen thousand dollars, yes you read it right).

However, if there are many interested people out there, to buy in
group, the price could possibly be talked down a little.  Just a
little, this is not a $100 card that is sold at a terrific profit,
it does actually cost real money to manufacture.  I have checked this
with the guys that constructed it.

Anyone interested shoudl call me for more details,  as soon as
ever possible,  202-374 9925 from 10.00 until late Eastern time

Oh, stupid me forgot to mention that this is the RM06, the DEC
"replacement" RP06.  That was so clear in my mind, so I guess you 
would know that....  It actually even slows down disk access to the
speed a KS-10 can handle.

I (and others) wrote terminal emulators which we used to talking to
the KI10 based TOPS-20 system used to design the KL10.  They were used
for a lot of CAM work.  (Yes, that was KI10 and TOPS-20 in the same

and get that out.

Good, so I'm not the only one with fond memories of the whole
'10/20 line. There is a lot more in common between blue and orange
KLs than there ever was between LCG and Vaxen.

>They were used for a lot of CAM work.  

Any old timer LCG-head willing to admit in public that one of the
major causes for killing the Jupitor was the lack of available time to

do all the CAM work to make a Jupitor really work?

Comments on the state of 1982-vintage massive pipeline architectures
welcome, but I understand why you might want to be quiet in a public
forum.

Hey Ric... I think I still have a copy of the -10 end of the roses
program as well as the teco file which ran the demo... somewhere...

If you don't have these parts, I'll look for them...

I also wrote a program a number of years ago which did the host-end
protocol for the down-line load of a GT40... the program (I called
it GTLOAD) ran on a pdp-11 running RT...  I'll have to look for
that as well...

I have a friend who was a fellow student at WPI during the
'70s who wrote a version of spacewar which ran off the
switches, but was also conditionalized to run with a DR11-C
wired to a set of boxes which provided the correct bit
for control.  There was also a console switch setting
which enabled or disabled gravity, or enabled or disabled
asteroids...

He did a great job with it... I think I have a set of sources
for it somewhere... but I'd have to contact him to see if
he's okay with releasing it.  Also, we'd have to come up with
some sort of schematic for the boxes... I still have my DR11-C
and home-made boxes for when I had it working on a VT11 at
home...

I know the GT40 we had at Wesleyan University had the mountains
permanently burned into the screen.

The one I used in the chem department at the University of Washington
also spent some of its time playing spacewar (almost wore out the toggle
switches) and chess (I took the standard pdp-11 chess program and added
GT40 graphics.)

Now and then, we would also use it for drawing and rotating pictures of
molecules.

Tymnet, now a division of MCI, sold their 4 KL10s recently, after replacing
them with two XKL Systems Toad-1's running Tops-20 v. 7.0.

At XKL, we are still running 1 KL10B, now under Tops-10 as a reference imple-

named Mathom; it is now named HEATER, in honour of its power dissipation...

I recently came across an 'old systems' web page which mentioned 10's
at Tymnet - said some KL's still in use, some KI's and KS's which were
described as 'retired' - presumably switched off but still on-site. I
promptly failed to bookmark the site and have been unable to find it
again!

Is this info totally out of date? What site were these machines on?
Does anyone know of any places where KI's may still exist? 

In particular, here in the UK, the 'last' KI, belonging to the
Scottish Special Housing Association, was dismantled and removed ?with
DEC assistance? by "The Scottish Museum of Computing", an organisation
which vanished without trace sometime later. Does anyone know what
became of this machine, or the people involved in the museum?

Thanks

Mike

    Back in '69 when I worked in PDP-10 engineering a few of
us used to play bridge and run to the cafeteria at 12:55 just
before it closed.
    One day we joined some TOPS-10 programmers who were talking
shop over lunch. One of them said, "Here's some users; let's
ask them." He then described some new feature they had just
added to the monitor on the development system, KA10 #2.
    One of us said, "Sounds good. What's the issue?"
    The reply, "It takes three words of resident code."
    It's been a long time since increasing the size of a
monitor by 3 words was suitable for a lunch time shop
discussion. It's also been a long time since the list price
of 3 words of memory was $9.16.
    Back then MA10 memory cost $50K for 16K words (80K x
8-bits) or $0.61/byte or $640K/Mbyte vs. ~$11/Mbyte today.

It should be noted that it actually was worse, given that KA memory was
produced during the Vietnam Era Inflation,  and the Arab Oil Embargo Inflation
which was followed by  the  Post-Vietnam/Oil Embargo Inflation <which ran
through Ford and Carter until the Reagan Recession, which had little effect on
the value of the dollar took hold>.

Guestimating the cost of core in 1996 dollars, we're probably looking at
better than $1,500/Mbyte.

That's *only* the cost of the memory.

Core *also* carried with it the substantial cost of 24-hour-day power and
cooling, floor space plus several hundred dollars <again, when a dollar was at
least half a dollar and not a quarter> a year for the service contract on
every box owned. And the largest KA-10 box, to my knowledge, held 256KWords.
(It should be noted that many big systems were junked because of the cost of
the service contracts, power, cooling and space. The service contract factor
oft seemed juggled, IMHO, to increase new machine sales.)

I don't remember it being that way.  It may have been a way to move
customers to other machines when (ahem) Digital got serious about dropping
support for PDP10s.  Customers tended to upgrade to newer hardware because
they needed the compute/storage power.  Please note that I'm talking about
PDP10s.  In the 80s, at least, there were some stupid pricing decisions
made.  But we tried to correct them as soon as we heard about them.

Hi Folks,

Here's some news about one of the most notable of our 36-Bit Pioneers.

After all the computer retirements we've heard about on this list,
this is a refreshing contrast...!
