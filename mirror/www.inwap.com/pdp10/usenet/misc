FWIW, I was contacted by this person about buying or renting one of my Altos.
I said I'd do it gratis for screen credit, and they wouldn't do it.

I think they would be better off building a wooden box with blinking lights
in it if all they want is a movie prop. I doubt they are going to find anyone
willing to sell or rent them a KA or KI for this purpose.

I wonder what kind of movie needs an Alto, DG Nova, and a 10..

I'd have to check the Alpha architecture book, but I think current Alphas
with their 8 KB page size only have a 43 bit virtual space.  Doubling
the page size means doubling the # pointers in a page table and an
extra bit for each of the three page tables an address traverses.
So when Alpha has a 64 KB page, it will have a 55 bit virtual
address space.

Celera Genomics has a system with 64 GB of RAM, that's 36 bits of
bytes, a -10 would only need about 34 address bits to cover 64 GB.

Current-generation SGI ccNUMA systems support up to a terabyte of main RAM
<URL:http://www.sgi.com/origin/3000/overview.html>, which is 40 bits of
real memory address. [The R10k CPU chip provides 64 bits of virtual address
(well, 63 bits usable in user mode) and 48(?) bits of useful physical
address out to the pins, and the Origin 3000 architecture can use up to
44(?) of them with the current support ASICs.]  And, yes, we've shipped
systems that big (512 CPU, 1TB RAM) already, and have promised NASA one
twice as big <URL:http://www.ecnmag.com/ecnmag/news/4384-236NewsDetail.asp>.

So 36 bits of byte address for physical memory definitely sounds too small,
to me at least...  [And *way* too small for virtual addresses!!]

Hiya.

Having downloaded the GPL release of the ITS kernel source code from
http://pdp10.nocrew.org/its/swiss/, I noticed that the sysdoc archive
included some mail archives in an old babyl-ish format. I therefore
wrote a Python 2.0 script to read these in and convert them to Unix
mbox format, attempting to preserve the original data as much as
possible. The script's at http://pils.us-lot.org/~azz/itsmailbox.py;
mail me if you'd prefer me to make the converted files available
somewhere (the original files are under the GPL, so I assume it'd be
OK).

Reading email older than me is scary.

I found this link using Google: <http://www.larkfarm.com/cardiac_answers.htm>

There's a list of opcodes there too (appended below), along with
pictures of the computer itself, and an address to order one.
