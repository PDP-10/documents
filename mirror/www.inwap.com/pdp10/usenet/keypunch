I dug around down in my basement to see if I still had any
Fortran II decks for the 1620.  Didn't find any but I did
find a lot more Macro-11 source on cards for the PDP-11 than
I remembered punching up.

IIRC, the 1st PDP 11/45 I used had one VT05, DECwriter, and
CR11 reader.  There were a lot more 029s available than VT05s.

We didn't have TECO and KED hadn't been released yet (1973).
Using SLP as an interactive editor was not much fun.
EDI was ok, but since the source was on cards anyway...

The technique I used when editing card decks was

  1. At my desk, with listing on one side and card deck on
     the other, mark changes on the card with felt tip pen.
     Cards to be added were sometimes written on scraps of
     paper and stuck in the deck.  Cards to be changed were
     turned upside down.  They stuck out from the notched
     corners of the rest of the deck.

  2. Take the deck over the the keypunch.  Small decks that
     could fit in one hand needed only a rubber band.
     Middle sized were put in the boxes that the blank cards
     came in - sometime shortened or else the back of the box
     stuffed with something to keep the cards from sliding
     around.  Wadded up listings were common.  Large decks
     had metal trays with sliders to hold the deck snug.
     The largest were a yard long.  Some were drawers in a
     dedicated card storage piece of furniture.  (Anyone
     save old catalogs which featured this kind of stuff?)
     Those large trays were a bother.  They didn't fit on
     the keypunch's built in table.  They hung over the edges
     and were prone to spilling.

  3. Flip the deck open to the first card to be edited.  Take
     it out and stick a pen or a blank card vertically in its
     spot.  Stick the card in the reader station, feed a blank
     into the punch station, duplicate up to the point of
     correction, type correction, advance/backup the old card
     if necessary, duplicate the remainder of the old card
     onto the new.  (I was/am a terrible typist.  It was easier
     and less error prone for me to do it this way than to
     retype an entire card.)

     I rarely took printout to the keypunch.  They were too
     big (11x15) to spread open (to 22x15) on the keypunch table.

Pardon my rambling.  You old farts already know all this and
the PC generation probably doesn't give a darn.  Its just that
I had the urge to tell about "walking to school barefoot, in
the snow, umpteen miles, uphill both ways."  :-)

For readers who never used a card punch and are wondering about the
above comment about the card stacker: on keypunches the output stacker
was on the left side of the machine, was at an angle of perhaps 45 (?)
degrees from vertical, and the newly-punched cards were added to it
from the bottom.

Cards exiting the read station would be driven to the far left end of
the card bed, then grasped by two clamps along the top edge.  The clamps,
mounted on a rotating shaft, would lift the card away from the bed,
then pull it under the cards currently in the stacker and release it.
The whole mechanism was something of a Rube Goldberg design, but
it worked.  (Usually...)
