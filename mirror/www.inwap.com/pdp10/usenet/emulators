Lemme see.  Ken Harrenstien (KLH), still at Oracle I think, wrote a KS-10
emulator years ago; that's the one I've seen running on Macs (including the
PB145).  KLH later revised it to emulate a KL-10B, and tried to sell it through
Digital as an Alpha Migration Tool; I don't know that anyone ever bought it
from Digital.

Then there's Stu Grossman, who wrote one while working at Stanford.  I saw an
early version running on his office Sparcstation; I know he's kept playing with
it over the years.

So that's three.  There are others (one written in PDP-10 assembler, to emulate
upwards to a new implementation of the architecture) of less use to the general
populace.

Computer History Simulators, V2.3
---------------------------------

In honor of the 40th anniversary of Digital Equipment Corporation on August 
23, I am pleased to announce the availability of V2.3 of the Computer 
History simulators at the following FTP site:

	ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/sim

Subdirectory sources contains the simulator sources, and subdirectory 
software contains sample software for the simulators.  All are compressed 
tar files.

The Computer History simulators include the following systems:

	system		sample software

	PDP-1		Lisp, courtesy L Peter Deutsch
	PDP-4
	PDP-7		SIM8, courtesy David J Waks
	PDP-8		ESI-X, courtesy David J Waks
			Focal69, courtesy Digital Equipment Corporation
			OS-8, under license from Digital Equipment 
Corporation
	PDP-9
	PDP-11		UNIX V5/6/7, under license from The Santa Cruz 
Operation
	PDP-15
	Nova		RDOS V7.5, under license from Data General 
Corporation
	IBM 1401	single card utilities

The simulators operate on most versions of UNIX and on OpenVMS.  The 
simulators compile under Visual C++ for Windows 95/Windows NT, but the 
terminal emulation is incomplete.

Major changes and improvements for V2.3:

1. Inclusion of the PDP-1, additional sample software for the PDP-1, PDP-7,
   and PDP-8, and large disks (RP/RM series) for the PDP-11.

2. Endian independence.  The simulator will now compile and operate
   correctly on big endian UNIX systems, without source modifications.

3. TERMIOS-based terminal handling.  The default terminal handler is based
   on TERMIOS and will compile and operate correctly on most UNIX systems,
   without source modifications.

4. Revised simulated magtape format.  The format for simulated magtape was
   revised to handle larger record sizes and reverse direction operations.
   A utility for converting from prior versions is included.

The simulator documentation includes a full revisions list.

The conceptual idea of "container files" for disks and tapes is
well developed in many other emulators.  The difficulty with emulating
a virtual RP is that if you want it to work with TOPS-10 or ITS,
you also have to emulate the Massbus subsystems.  This is extremely
difficult, though not impossible, because many of the details
necessary to do this were never publicly documented.  (This didn't
stop some from figuring it out from the schematics, though.)

Interesting.  Bob Supnik's Nova emulator appears to work just fine, and
I've used it to run many pieces of RDOS software.  What problem prevents
you from releasing it, but allows Bob to do so?

I'll take a wild guess at what the Eclipse problem is: the microcode,
which is copyrightable?

Bob Supnik's PDP-8, PDP-11, PDP-1, Nova, and 18-bit (PDP-4, -7, -9, and -15)
emulators (and a version of RDOS that runs on them) are
available from

  ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/sim

Bob has succesfully persuaded the current owners of Unix to allow
emulator use of Unix System 5, 6, and 7 binaries, and he has also
gotten permission from Data General to include a release of RDOS 7.50
for use on the Nova emulator.

It seems that Dec itself has the rights to the pdp-10 emulator now.  This
can be seen by the fact that they "gave" Gates a copy, as well as some
other evidence I have uncovered this week.  

Ok, here is the question: If they (Dec) post on their FTP server (in the
sim directory), the pdp emulators, why don't they also post the emulator
they own for the pdp-10?  Why do they post the full operating system images
for the pdp-11, nova, etc but refuse to post the images for Tops?

Bob.Supnik@digital.com is the person who seems to maintain the sim
directory.  He is also responsible for the Corporate Research and Advanced
Development at Digital: http://www.research.digital.com/
He is also the person who wrote one of the pdp-11 emulators out there.

I would like everyone out there who wishs to run the pdp-10 emulator to
petition Digital to post the pdp-10 emulator and images they have.  Any
reasons they give not to would be crushed by the fact that they are posting
ones for the pdp-11.

Please use the above information in sending your messages to Dec.

It's been mentioned before in alt.sys.pdp10 that getting an emulator up
and running to where it could run EDDT is not too hard.  But in that
case, you are running the user-mode instructions plus the read/write from
the console terminal.

But as soon as you attempt to enable interrupts, you've got a hold new can of
worms to deal with.  The goal is to run the ITS or other Monitor *WITH NO
CHANGES*.  That is, load SYSTEM.EXE verbatim off of an emulated RP06.  This
last part takes a couple of man-years of effort, and relies on information
that is not documented in any DEC manual.

Well, this depends on what you want to emulate.  One *could* design
new, emulated "devices" that aren't so hairy, and add new drivers for
them to the kernel.  One would then know exactly how the new
subsystems work and could be reasonably certain of having a usable
system.  If a usable system is one's goal, and all sources are
available, it might not be unreasonably hard for a sharp team.

If one insists on being able to emulate, say, a DTE, you've taken on
quite a different project.  Bit-for-bit and bug-for-bug emulation is
not for the faint of heart.

(OK, let the corrections roll.  I did a fair amount of customization
and debugging on DN87S, but didn't actually have to touch the DTE code
on either side.  Likewise with DAS79, and I don't even remember what
10/11 adaptor we had back then, I'm ashamed to say.)

That was certainly the *goal* of the SC-30M, though it wasn't entirely met--it
was not *completely* bug-for-bug compatible with the KL10B, although it tried.

Because the SC-30M was a pipelined architecture, something that should not have
worked on the KL10B (but did) failed in the SC box:  In the EXEC command-editor
was located an instruction

	POP P,0(P)

which caused, on the SC box, some very subtle errors.  I fixed the EXEC at
Stanford, rather than running off to Stewart to make this particular bogosity
work.

It most emphatically is *not* the goal for the TOAD-1, which is a PDP-10 but
not fully compatible with the DEC systems:  Larger address space, different I/O
model, modern peripherals, etc.

It might be really good if someone could start collecting any such
undocumented gotchas as people remember them, or encounter them (if
anyone else out there is trying to write an emulator).  This could be
added to a pdp-10 faq...

   There was some limited pipelining done in the -10 line, at least
in the later models. Usually this had to do with beginning a fetch
before the previous instruction completed.

   The PDP-6 (the -10's progenitor) and the KA-10 were asynchronous
machines, the KI-10 was a synchronous time-state machine, and the
KL- and KS-10 were microcode implementations (pretty much by definition
synchronous).

   One of the reasons that the -10 looms so large in hacker (_true_
hacker, that is - not the modern usage) lore is that one got to
spend lots of time on them and learn all the little ins and outs of
them.

   Usually an undocumented "oddity" (unlike now where an un-
documented problem is a "bug" and a documented one a "feature") would
be discovered by accident and some enterprising soul would find a
way to exploit it to advantage (speed or code size). If a "thingy"
was particularly nasty, DEC would issue an ECO to fix it (the floating
point divide comes to mind). If it wasn't too bad, it'd get left
alone.

   To give an idea of the level -10 "heads" went to, one never used
the "JUMP" instruction to branch to another location, one used
"JRST" (Jump and ResTore flags) with no flag bits set. It used fewer
CPU cycles and, hence, was a smidgen faster than "JUMP". Note
that this behaviour is _not_ a bug.

> or Stanford?)

   I suspect that "sneaky code" came from everywhere about equally.
Sometimes finding a "bug" in a machine you can exploit to improve
performance is a Good Thing. Of course being "bug-compatible" is
_very_ difficult to get right in a simulator and usually requires
a set of logic prints and microcode listings (if applicable) to
model the code after.

It almost does --- it's a simulator for the PDP-10 instruction
set written in Lisp.

Will Tops-10 run on it ? No.

Just checked in the rest of the halfword instructions.
This puts our list of implemented instructions at ... ... all of the
halfword instructions, and EXCH.  Cute.

I also figured out what I did to FTP and the CVS daemon, and fixed it.
Sorry :) Paranoia after a breakin...

You (should) be able to fetch it from bony.umtec.com in /pub/ka10.
Is anyone testing this cruft to make sure it works like it's supposed to?

I have the DECsystem 10/20 Processor Refrence Manual from 36bit.org,
and I plan on emulating everything in it that I can.  And if I can't, I'll
fake it, or find someone to explain it to me.  Thing is, I have to haul

With all due respect, and with absolutely no intent to discourage you or
dampen your youthful enthusiasm, I must inform you that your "43% done" is
extremely optimistic.  You may have implemented 43% of the user mode
machine instructions, but that part of the task is less than 20% of the
overall work necessary to produce an emulator that can run any of the
operating systems.

Or, more accurately, an emulator that can run EDDT (meaning that you have
basic console I/O done) is about 20% of the task.

I/O and the virtual memory system is a *huge* task, and often you are not
going to find the answers from reading the manual; you will have to
analyze EDDT and operating system sources.

It may also be helpful to analyze microcode sources as well; in
particular, you may think that you've implemented floating point
correctly, until you actually try running real software and find that you
have not.

I wish you the best of luck in your project, but having observed the
progress of Stu's incomplete emulator and Ken's completed emulator, I
strongly urge you to prepare yourself for much more work than you
anticipate.  I would hate to see you become discouraged when reality
sets in (and it will) and abandon the project.

You're probably about 8% done.  Good luck.

I do not have Mr. Crispin's experience in the 10, but I do have to agree
with him on the size of the task you have set before you.  Have you thought
of implementing a KS-10?  It was a later machine, and though it did not have
as much capacity or thoroughput as the KL, there were lots fewer options.  I
think it could run TOPS-10 and TOPS20, and if someone could run ITS, that
would cover the audience nicely.  The simpler machine, and the less complex
the interface to the hardware the better if you have to emulate it.  I think
the KS-10 was microcoded, and emulating the microcode might be a good route
too.  The KL was the big boy on the block though, and there will be a lot of
people who would not settle for an emulation of anything less.  But as far
as I can tell there is a bigger chance of you getting on a real KS-10 than a
KL-10 in order to compare your results, power and housing costs being what
they are.

Chris Ward

If you were building a machine from scratch, a PDP-10 like machine (in the
fashionable 32 or 64 bits) might be made to work quite well.

Hello Folks:

Thank you for your few answers quickly.   I found http://www.36bit.org for
much informaton about DEC systems and PDP-10 emulator software that still is
under developement.

Megan wrote statements in private message:

Oh, the hardware is dino-sized - too large for my home!  Without my ownship
of any hardware, I can't get any software or manuals?  How about TOPS-10/20
operating systems software and any layered products?  That's why I am
looking for them to can run pdp-10 emulators.  I can develop my own PDP-10
emulator under 'C' language.

I found some manuals (PDF format) on this web site.  I can sign license
agreement to get manuals regardless of ownship of dino-sized hardware?
right?

If so, I would appericate that.  Thank you!

However, back in 1985 DEC issued a notice allowing anyone (actually the
phrasing is "Digital customers" so if you aren't one, buy a printer ribbon or
something!)  to copy discontinued software documentation (only!).  This was
inside the front cover of one of those wonderful software documentation
catalogs they used to send out, the key passage is quoted in:

TOIL (Ten On an Intel Laptop) is no longer a joke; it is reality.

I finally bought a PC notebook (an NEC 120LT, a 100MHz Pentium-class CPU
with 32MB RAM and 2GB hard drive for $1000), and spent a couple of hours
porting the PDP-10 emulator (an old, KS-only, version of klh10) to Windows
98.  It was surprisingly easy, once I found the Windows console routines.

It runs TOPS-20 at about twice the speed of a real 2020.  This is without
any tuning; among other things I'm using POSIX calls.  I think that I/O
(especially console I/O) would run much better using native Windows calls.

Mark

Where can I get My copy...   

Just got rid of a dozen KL10's and have a couple of SC's running
TOPS-10 which replaced them. Two DN20 cabnets, replace half a room of
equipment, 9track tape drive, 8mm tape drives, 30 disk drives.

Thanks

The long-in-progress Rewrite 4 of E10-KL10 is released.  This version
fixes more than a few screws present in the first draft.

For one, the CPU is no longer in the main loop, it's in it's own function.
The state of this function is controlled by a micropc variable - One could
say it was "microcoded".  This means instructions are now interruptable,
by the PI system as well as the console :)

Also, the halfword memory system was flushed.  Memory is now an array of
unsigned long longs.  These are much easier to deal with.

Other than that, this is a complete recode.  It's mostly untested at the
moment as I try catching up to where I was originally.
It currently lives at ftp://bony.umtec.com/pub/kl10.  Have fun.

Okay, due to a large screw-up on my part[1] and a larger screw-up on my
stepdad's part[2], I may lose my job today.  If this happens, I'll lose my
inet access for a little while.  The E10KL10 page and site will go down,
but I have backups, so it's OK.  But, I won't be seeing anyone for
awhile.  Just figured I'd let everyone know...


[1] I got really busy and didn't clock in for a lot of the last pay
    period.  Yes, I know how stupid that is.  Anyway, I'm not getting
    paid.  (This has happened before.)
[2] He's going to call and harass my boss.  He thinks this is illegal.
    Either way, I'm either going to get fired over him bothering my boss,
    or my stepdad will make me quit.  Like I said, this is not good.

Gomen, my fudge.  Details follow:

DDT is not one of DEC's, sorry.  The first DDT I got source for was ITS's
Exec DDT.  It's loadable to the emulator as a SBLK format binary, and it's
the file ddt.sbk on the FTP site.  The MIDAS listing file (Read: source
code) is ddt.lst, and ddt.asc is the result of the 36bit-to-ASCII program
I ran on TOAD to get the binary to my PC.  Anyway, here's how to reproduce
my screw.  Load the emulator:

-----
bony:/kl10# decsystem10
NEW-KL10 SIM CONSOLE 127
Setting up the terminal
KL>
-----

Now type "RS ddt.sbk".  The emulator will load the SBLK file of DDT, and
go back to the not-running prompt.  Then, start the emulator at 774000
(The DDT entry point).

------
KL> RS ddt.sbk
[Snipped SBLK loader messages]
KL> ST 774000
------

You will get a few newlines after a few seconds, and then DDT is waiting
for a command.  I want to open location 774000 and see what's in it, so
type "774000/".  DDT will type a tab character and hang here.

------



774000/	_ <- It hangs with the cursor here.

------

At this point, push ^\  (Control-slash).  The emulator will give you the
running prompt, so you have to halt the processor.

------

774000/	 %CONSOLE MODE
KL: HA
%REQUESTING CPU HALT
KL: CPU: Console requested stop at 195
%DECSYSTEM-10 NOT RUNNING
CPU: DPB 5 777103 | PC 400200,,774224
%CONSOLE MODE
KL> 

------

At this point I'm quite unable to determine exactly what happens.

It's in the symbol-table lookup probably.  I'm currently trying to check
every instruction I've coded so far.  I already tried single-stepping the
whole thing and I never noticed anything.

I dunno.  You have to keep in mind that outside of TDs, I've never seen a
live PDP-10.  All I have is documentation for TOPS-20, documentation for
the CPU, and the sources for ITS and TOPS-10.  And some old KA-era
documentation for TOPS-10 and the KA processor.

Besides, I wasn't asking for people to look at MY code.  My code is known
broken, and I code in such a manner that even I can't understand how it
works afterward ^_^.  I'm asking for someone to poke through Exec DDT and
see where instruction(s) don't do what they're supposed to.  I can find my
faults from that.  Probably.

Sigh!  It looks like nobody wants to mess with this can
of worms.  

I have no idea what an ITS DDT is.  I do believe (but am
not sure) that DEC's EDDT (which is already in SYSTEM.EXE)
is incestuously involved with the TOPS10 monitor.  In other
words, you seem to be trying to mix apples and oranges to
produce grapes.  :-)  I don't know if there's any ITS
gurus that read this newsgroup so I can't tell if they
ever picked up our DDT sources for their use after EXE,
VM, and extended addressing implementations.

E10-KL10 132 is now out.  This one has the (hopefully last) fix to the IO
system, more RH10 code (No, it still doesn't work.), some code for the
TM10A (It will become a TM10B when I finally figure out the [CENSORED]
DF10), and other miscellaneous.

This time around, if we start ITS at the GO: point (Skipping the SALV
checks), it gets as far as turning on paging, with only one undefined
instruction along the way.  (It's XCTR).
Paging isn't written yet, so you get a microcode stop. (The emulator will
stop itself.)

Speaking of paging - Does anyone know how KL10 ITS paging works? I have
the microcode and can try figuring it out from that, but if anyone else
knows this already and can explain it, that will save me a lot of time. (I
have no idea how the microcode works.  I tried reading it for some other
reason, and I just confused the hell out of myself.  I bet writing it was 
a real pain in the ass... gate this to that and skip here and so on and
so forth...)

SALV itself doesn't go yet.  The RH10 heavily screwed up.  I have
absolutely no documentation for it, just the source to SALV and the
comments therein. ^_^

Also, the tape stuff uses a soon-to-be-heavily-hacked copy of
tapeio.[c,h], which John Wilson and Eric Smith wrote.  The effect of this
is that tapes from John's tape-manipulation stuff (t10backup, itstar) will
(maybe) be readable to the emulator.  I have to hack up some of the
unimplemented stuff, and get rid of the exit()s in it.  Other than that it
should work mostly out-of-the-tarfile.  Thanks guys.

Other than that, moving right along here.  This is going to be cutting it
incredibly close if I make my deadline! ^_^ (For those who don't know, my
goal is to have an ITS running in time for 2000.)

No, He's running Stu's emulator, which runs TOPS-10.
However, Stu's emulator isn't freely available.

I'm the one with ITS. ^_^ He's having other problems entirely.
He's trying to run TOPS-10 so he can play DECWAR.

Bleh, when I figure out what I'm doing I'll run TOPS-10 (And maybe
TOPS-20, I dunno if it's worth the trouble) too.

I'd like to know if anyone has a copy of the source to MIDAS from ITS.
I've checked all the directories that Alan has graciously made
available (SYSDOC, SYSTEM, .TECO., .INFO., KSHACK, EMACS, EMACS1) but
none of them contain what I want.  The reason I want them is so I can
implement a MIDAS-like assembler for E10 (Daniel Seagraves's KL10
emulator) to be used in UN*X userland.  If the idea pans out then I
might even write an {X,FSF}Emacs mode for it too (I don't intend to
translate the TECO version unless someone can convince me otherwise).

I'm also ISO the sources to MacLisp.  If anyone knows where I could
get source to NCOMPLR, COMPLR, LIBLSP, ets., I'd be very, very
grateful.  I want them because I'm a Lisp and Scheme fanatic as well
as a retrocomputing freak, and would thus like to merge the two
psychoses.  My eventual goal is to make MacLisp work on E10 so that I
can play with archaic AI programs and learn more about the 'Golden
Age' from the source (bad pun).

BTW, this message has been posted on the e10 mailing list as well.

"Several"?  I can think of only 2--Harrenstien's and Grossman's.  Further, both
emulate the PDP-10 hardware, not the monitor, so either will run Tops-10 if you
can lay hands on it.

Anyone who is covered by the hobbyist license is welcome to lay
their hands on it at

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

Sources are there, too, handy for those of us struggling to get our
PDP-10 emulators ready for release.

While there, check out the several hundred megabytes of TOPS-10
and TOPS-20 freeware.  (I've got the abstracts to the numerically
ordered DECUS entries in hardcopy, they're going to appear on the
HTML indices and CD-ROM Real Soon Now.)

But Harrentstien's isn't available, is it... and there *are* a couple
more efforts going to create a pdp-10 emulator.  I can think of three
others right off the bat... one of which is Daniel Seagraves', who
posts here occasionally... the two others I know don't want to be
revealed at this time.

As for TOPS-10, check out the archive site at trailing-edge.com...

If you mean that you were not able to snail-mail a printed and signed
copy to DEC/Compaq, that's no longer necessary.  Bob Supnik provided
a revised license which removes that requirement, which can be seen

I think that was true for the version of the emulator that did a KS-10.

He later did a version that was supposed to become an official Migration Tool
for the 36-bit to Alpha VMS customers; I don't think there were any of those to
pay for it, and I think he took it back from Digital.  It definitely did a KL,
and it definitely did Tops-10 and Tops-20--I was at the DECUS BOF that talked
about it.

The KL microcode sources and assembler used to be downloadable from MIT-MC.
I remember asking Don Lewine why DEC didn't freak out and sue MIT for leaving
what was then a $25,000 DEC product lying around where anyone could copy it,
and I liked his answer -- the $25,000 price tag is actually paying for the
right to gripe to DEC about the micromachine bugs that a user would surely run
into when trying to run something other than DEC's own microcode.  DEC didn't
have to pay any attention to bug reports from pirates, and as piracy goes,
stealing the microcode isn't such a big deal, since it's only useful if you
have a KL10 anyway and $25K is small change compared to what you paid for that.

   That all depends.

   Running without its cache, a KL-10 was actually slower than the
KA-10.  I tried this using the timing diags back in the early '80s
when I still had unfettered access to all 3 (KA, KI, and KL) types.

   I'll agree that a tightly-written program on the KL would beat the
11/780 every time, but one needs to remember that the 11/780 had better
memory bandwidth than the -10 had.

   The "VUP" is useless as a performance measure -- it's not portable
between architectures.  It was strictly a marketing measure, so treat
it as such.

   MIPS isn't too much better; it's more a measure of what the main-
store can provide.  A 1-microsecond-cycle core store can happily
yield one MIPS (with no DMA/channel accesses, of course).

Yep.  Consider a KL-1091 or an upgraded KL-1090:

  TOPS-10 7.01 - runs with older "TOPS-10" (KI paging) microcode.
  TOPS-10 7.02 - runs with newer "TOPS-20" (KL paging) microcode; uses
    extended addressing in Exec mode.  No support for nonzero sections
    in User mode, although you could execute in the ACs in section 1.
  TOPS-10 7.03 - full support for extended addressing in User mode.

All three ran on the same hardware.  Or you could swap out the RP06
disk pack and run TOPS-20 on that hardware.  (This is assuming that
you did a full reset, forcing the console front-end to reload the
microcode from the new boot pack.)

That, Barb, was a TOPS-10 problem.  TOPS-20 shipped pre-built monitors.

Here is my two cents on the emulator projects:

My goal of running an emulator is to run decwars on the internet FREE.
I have a T3 available, and could set this up easily.  My requirements
are that the emulator supports networking, and runs Tops-10.

*  Thanks to Tim Shoppa, the distributions for Tops-10, Tops-20, tools,
and microcode are on the net for easy downloading, along with lots of
other software.

*  From previous postings, it seems that each version of the OS may be
hardware specific.

*  I have a version of an windows emulator which runs Tops-20, not in a
networking environment, and has no tape support. (klh's)

Are the developers writing the emulator to one of the OS's on Shoppa's
site?  This would allow a large # of people to use the emulator.

Is there a version of Tops-10 which supports telnet or rlogin access?

I know of several developers: Daniel Seagraves, Ken Harrenstein, Stu
Grossman, and Megan Gentry.

Finally, there seems to be two sites with emulator packages on it (less
than complete)
1)  Daniel Segraves  ftp://bony.umtec.com/pub/kl10/
2)  Megan Gentry:  ftp://ftp.std.com/ftp/pub/mbg/pdp10/
    Note, several of the files on Megan's site are protected and cannot
be downloaded.  KX10 is Stu Grossman's and Sim10 is Megan's.  Alas, the
source for Ken's emulator is not released.

I hope this discussion will assist the developers in achieving their
goal!

Hi everyone, I have been trying to follow this discussion with exactly the
same idea, getting decwars on the internet, as a reasonable project to learn
more about the PDP-10 and keep it alive. A lot of the hardware discussion is
over my head but it does seem like the first step is getting TOPS-10 up.?.
In 96 there was some discussion of this and I vaguely remember someone here
in Texas had a webpage about their PDP-10/decwars project but I got
sidetracked long ago. The discussion here has really been great and it is
appreciated! It would be great to collaborate on this project!

I picked up a VAXstation with the vague notion that it would be
aesthetically nice to try and work with DEC hardware but any platform will
do.

Is it feasible for TOPS-10 to either support IP or tunnel the terminal
interface over IP?

Cheers,

Noah

Actually I dont even know what a KLH is... this is bi5.bootstrap.org's
telnet prompt:

www.inwap.com/pdp10/models.txt shows the 2065 as:

2065    KL10-E/R(PW), big cache, MOS memory,  TOPS-20 using extended

same difference?

Oh, Joe [lamenting emoticon here].  One of the problems we
had with you was that you were not practical.  The boot tape
was _designed_ to literally get a cold system started.  That
meant that the code included in SYSTEM.EXE was extremely
hardware dependent, stripped to the barest essentials so
that a real system could get installed.  Nobody ran that 
monitor after their system was established and all the software
built to match the hardware and software configurations.

But you will never have an RP06 disk.  Think for a second.
All disk I/O done via the emulator will have to interface
with the device driver of the hard disk that is on your
system.  Now, that means that all of TW's disk drivers will
consist of the few entry points with a POPJ P, or a JRST
to the resident device driver entry point.

You do want to do some useful work, don't you?

Consider all the ramifications of code dealing with the &$#%&
KL cache.  Consider that none of the CPUs that you will run
this emulator on will be a 36-bit word architecture.  Consider
that none of the I/O devices will be of DEC PDP-10 manufacture.
Consider that none of the network will be DECnet nor ANF10
protocol.

Hardware in some cases and a version skew of LINK in other
cases.   The reason we had to live with KI addressing on
a KL was we didn't get the LINK that supported the KL
instruction set.

Answer my question.  Don't give me a red herring.  The function
of the CONOs was to deal with specific hardware settings.  Right?
Look, I've never programmed these so give me a specific CONO
instruction with a description of what it did...and we'll go

Yeah, it is impractical to expect TOPS-10 to have the features that
TOPS-20 did, such as reasonable pre-built monitors.  Even the boot tape's
MONITR.EXE was reasonable to run as a production monitor.  Did TOPS-10
ever fix the bogosity that you had to rebuild the monitor every time you
added a new disk drive?

In TOPS-20, any KL monitor would run on any KL system; ditto any KS
monitor on any KS system. The only real difference was that some monitors
were build with smaller size limits to give users more memory on tiny
systems.  [Later, DEC decided to make TCP/IP monitors a separate product,
but that was marketing bogosity.  TCP/IP monitors worked just fine on a
non-TCP system, they were just bigger.]

Sorry, Barb.  There *were* things that TOPS-20 had that were much better
than TOPS-10.  And with all due respect to Tony, one of those things was
PHYSIO.  If it makes you feel any better, TENEX was just as bad as TOPS-10
that way; PHYSIO was a DEC creation.

In the last years of the SAIL system (it and TOPS-10 had a common ancestor
in PDP-6 days) when SAIL used RP07s, we ended up throwing out all the old
disk and tape code and grafting in PHYSIO in its place.

Too bad that was never done for TOPS-10.  But the PDP-10 groups (both of
them) had major Not Invented Here disease, and were busy sniping each
other while VMS was slitting both their throats.

It didn't have to be that way.  Perhaps in the KA and KI days, it did; but
by the time of the KL it was possible to do things right.

Or with the filesystem system calls of the operating system.  The KLH10
emulator has a single big file that represents a RP06 disk; it's opened
with open(), read with read(), written with write(), and addressed with
lseek().

My relatively slow NEC laptop emulates a KS10 system with MASSBUS disks
and tapes faster than a real KS10.  Faster boxes can emulate an ordinary
KL faster than a real KL.

So why spend all that time developing new device drivers, etc. when you
can run your unmodified binaries from 20 years ago?

All of these are solved problems.

DECnet isn't particularly interesting (nor for that matter anything in
today's pathetic remnants of DEC).  TCP is what is interesting.  I don't
think that DEC ever did TCP for TOPS-10, but it was done outside DEC.

But that's the whole *point* of software emulators -- to run original software
unchanged, including OSes.  Emulating complicated seemingly irrelevant stuff
like RHes and RP06es when you're really doing I/O on PC hardware, or worse yet,
read()/write() calls, may seem inelegant but it works surprisingly well, and
anyway doing a faithful hardware emulation and treating the software as a
"black box" really has a better chance of succeeding than trying to rewrite
*all* of the OS's device drivers and memory management stuff simultaneously,
while debugging your instruction set emulation, and hoping that the resulting
frankenstein will run.

PCs are a horrible design but ya gotta give them credit, they're *fast*
(even if they aren't anywhere near as fast as they would be with a decent
I/O system).  In my PDP-11 emulator I go the whole 9 yards, software RP06es,
TU77s, RH11s/RH70s, TU56es, TU60s, RP03s, RS04s, DELUAs, and everything else.
In some cases it takes a ridiculous amount of code to make the original device
drivers happy (the whole project is up to 135K lines of code now, only about
5K of which are the base instruction set), but it all runs in a flash and
the resulting system is *way* faster than the high-end PDP-11s, *especially*
in I/O-intensive systems.  All the yuckiness is at the endpoints of the I/O
transfer, doing the math on the cyl/track/sector numbers and dealing out the
ATN interrupts for seek completion and simultaneous rewinds and all that crap,
but in the middle you're just blazing away copying the bits in and out of
the emulated memory.

Plus, a dump of a real system is often all you have to work with, so there
can be chicken/egg problems otherwise.  I guess I just must have *forgotten*
to hack in a complete set of 8-bit-byte-oriented SCSI device drivers and dump
them to tape, the last time I had my KS10 running!  :-)  Seriously I wish I
really *had* written a TU80 boot block, keeping a TU45 alive and well is
*definitely* not practical.  Well, some day.

KLH is Ken L. Harrenstein, who wrote a PDP-10 emulator, in two versions.  The
first was a KS10 emulator; the second was a KL10 emulator, which Digital tried
to sell to 36-bit customers as a tool for migrating from the PDP-10 to Alpha
systems running VMS.  As far as I know, no one was ever that desperate.

Cool.  That means that Doug Englebart (inventor of the mouse and so much more)
is running the system he created at SRI (once the only place to get an IP
address on the Internet) on Ken Harrenstein's emulator on a Sparc.

We tried to sell Doug a Toad-1, but the Navy (his funding agency) wouldn't go
for it.

Well, only in that KLH's emulator looks like a 2065.

OK, I understand, and I apologize for the confusion.

SRI-NIC was indeed a KL, running Tops-20.  It provided several services to the
ARPANET, and to the early Internet, such as hosting the FTP repository for the
RFC library, and the official HOSTS.TXT file, and so on.

Doug Englebart ended up at SRI after British Telecom sold Tymnet to MCI,
continuing to work on the Human Augmentation project, his ideas for using
computers to increase the ability of human beings to do whatever work they
wished to do.  The particular piece of software I had in mind was the AUGMENT
system, which ran on TENEX and on Tops-20, and which he put on SRI-NIC when
he was there.

Since SRI-NIC was decommissioned a while back, I was glad to see that Doug's
work is continuing, now on an emulated KL.  He's a very nice man, and I enjoyed
working with him briefly while I was at Stanford.

Actually, it'd be entirely consistent with the history of PDP-10
emulators.  I know of at least 4 fairly complete PDP-10 emulators,
one of which really boots and runs TOPS-20, yet the authors of these
emulators have yet to discuss technical details or release the
code.  There is another emulator under development, and its author
has offered to let me into an "exclusive club" of inner knowledge
about development, but only on the condition that I not discuss
the details with the world at large.  I refused membership in that
"club" because I don't like that attitude, though I really do give
my best wishes to the developer and attempt to help him out whenever
I'm asked questions by him.

Similarly, I know of several sets of TOPS-10 and TOPS-20
distribution tapes sitting in a basement or a storage space, in
probably rather poor environmental conditions, just rotting away because
the current owners don't want to share them.

It's a shame that this "my-my-me-me-mine" attitude exists, but
what's a guy to do about it?  The emulator authors are entitled to do
whatever they want with their own code, and the owners of a tape
can just let it sit there and rot away, and we can't force them to
share if they don't want to.

I've tried to change this attitude with the establishment of an
archive - 

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

- for distribution of tape and disk images for emulator development
(under the conditions of the DEC 36-bit hobbyist license)
but so far there have been exactly two contributors.  Not to belittle
the contributions of those two kind folks - we all owe our thanks
to the distribution tapes they've donated - but I was kind-of hoping
there'd be a more sharing attitude among the folks who posess the
materials.

Tim.

Well, it's certainly nice to see a message about something besides real
flamewars, shell scripts, TOPS-20 vs. Unix, and/or annoying MRC ... :-)

I'm working on a similar project (though I haven't touched it in some
time).  The only System Reference I can help with is the KS10 reference.
Go get ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/alan/kshack.tgz which is some of
the KS10-specific bits from ITS.  It is a gzip'ed tar file.  Within that
archive, you will find a file called "ref.1", which is the KS10 reference.
I found that to be extremely valuable in understanding how I/O works on
the KS10 (especially stuff like interacting with the CTY, which as far as
I can tell, isn't documented anywhere else).

There is also the KS10 microcode for ITS, and some other interesting stuff.

If you are going to emulate a KS10, it is also helpful to have copies
of the PDP-11 Peripherals Handbook, the PDP-11 Terminals and Communications
handbook, and possibly the PDP-11/70 processor reference - all of the
disk/tape/communications devices on the KS10 are UNIBUS devices (MASSBUS
disk and tape via RH11-C UNIBUS/MASSBUS adapter), and you will find hints
about them in these books.

I would expect that the user mode programs should work just fine across
any processor, but the KS10 monitors won't run on the KL10 (or any other
processor).  I'm trying to track down a set of TOPS-20 V7 tapes for KL10
right now, but I don't know if I will be successful (I also have a line
on a complete set of TOPS-20 tapes for KS10 - what's on the trailing-edge
archive just a the moment isn't complete).  I will turn this material over
to Tim Shoppa for archiving if I am successful.

I certainly don't want to discourage you from implementing whatever you
wish, but you will probably have a much greater chance for success if
you work towards the KS10; it's a much simpler machine than the KL10,
and the low-level docs you will need are more easily available for the
KS10 than for other processors.  I would not think that emulating a
KI10 or KA10 would be that interesting, as you will probably have
difficulty finding software to run on it - emulating a KA10 would
actually be really interesting to me, if I could find a hardware
description of the BBN Pager somewhere, and if I could find a copy
of TENEX somewhere, but I have not been able to locate either of
those two items.  In the unlikely event that you could find software
for it, one might also try emulating the PDP-6, but I've never seen
any archived PDP-6 software anywhere ...

I ported an old version (KS10) on KLH's emulator to both Mac and to
Win9x/NT/Win2K.

On a modestly fast Pentium class machine, it emulates a KS10 faster than a
KS10 is a KS10.  I contend that it can be considered to be a real PDP-10,
on the grounds that if you don't because of the emulation, then you must
also consider anything after a KI not to be a "real PDP-10" since the
later machines were all microcoded.

Forget it.  There are no PDP-10 emulators.  There never have been,
and there never will be.  From time to time, someone will try
to tell you that someone named "KLH" wrote one.  It's a myth.
He never existed, and there's certainly no emulator.

There are at least forty-eight other non-existent emulators that
people will, from time to time, try to convince you are real.
No one has offered convincing evidence that any of them have ever
actually existed. They are figments of fevered, wishful imaginations.

Your only hope is that one of the four-hundred-and-eighty ongoing
projects to write a PDP-10 emulator will eventually produce
something that compiles.  At least a third of these projects are also
completely imaginary, so don't get your hopes up.  Those that aren't
will be ready for (limited) public review under strict NDA within
eight years if current agressive development schedules are met.

TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 software is available online thanks to Tim Shoppa
and some anonymous donors.  Plenty more would be, but the community
has largely, and very wisely, decided that it would be far better if
the existing software were allowed to mildew unsaved in basements.
This will preserve its purity so it is not touched by infidels.

So, there, you see the situation hopeless.  The only way to win
is not to play.

</rant>

On a serious note, I don't mean to disparage the very real hard work
of people like Daniel Seagraves, Megan Gentry, and (apparently)
Timothy Stark.  But I'm getting tired of hearing about PDP-10
emulators.  I've been hearing about KLH's, Stu's and others for what
feels like DECADES, but so far absolutely NO ONE has provided any
proof that they're real.  I have no reason to doubt that they are,
but you've all got to know how frustrating it is by now.

I've never used a PDP-10, in any of its many forms.  I've wanted
to for a very long time.  I've been interested in finding out what
made TOPS-10 so special for so many people, but I don't think I'm
going to any time soon, unless one of these MYSTICAL emulators
eventually appears.

Some of you may be saying to yourself "Jeesh, this guy has no right
to complain.  Has he ever tried to write an emulator himself?  Has
he even OFFERED to help Megan or Daniel?  What a twit."  And you'd
be right.  I've never done a lick of work to make it happen.  But
that doesn't change how silly the whole situation is.  I mean,
come on.

Yeah, I still hope something will come of all these emulators.
But I'm not holding my breath.  I do wish that what sounds like a
very interesting and historical technology could be preserved for
future use.  If we're all lucky, it will be, eventually.

A good number of the emulator (simulator?) authors are a bit afraid
that releasing their current source code would require that they
support it.  I'm of the other opinion - if they release their
current source code (I don't care if it's GPL or not GPL, I do
*not* want to get into that religious war!) then others will support
it.

What's really encouraging is that several of the authors of the DECUS
freeware in the archives have wandered across the collection and told
me that they appreciate seeing software that they used or wrote
themselves, sometimes 30 or more years ago.

You're welcome :-).  It's nice to see that at least I - and both the
anonymous and not-so-anonymous donors mentioned at the archive home
page,

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

- come off as the good guys.  We're really trying.  I've seen some
emulator progress mentioned here as a result of the sources being
available and browsable, and that's a Good Thing.  So far
several hundred people have visited the archive site and downloaded
or browsed through the software available, and that's a Good Thing
too.

It really breaks my heart and pains me that so much software
is out there just rotting away.  Some of the current holders of the
tapes don't understand that the tapes *are* still readable (sure,
not everyone has 9-track and 7-track drives anymore, and not
everyone has the ability to read and decode TOPS-10 BACKUP or
TOPS-20 DUMPER tapes, but I do!), others don't understand that there
is a wide interest in the software.

There are some other organizations - such as computer museums - that
probably don't understand the value of the tapes or disks
they currently have in their collection.  Many of these museums
have members/volunteers that read this newsgroup, and I hope that
those readers pay attemtion to my plea below.

Thus I'll repeat my plea:

If anyone has any PDP-10 software covered by the DEC 36-bit hobbyist
license, please get it to me.  I'll pay shipping both ways, and I'm
an expert at archiving old data.  Your tapes will be properly cared
for, carefully read, and returned.  If you want, you'll be thanked
on the archive page for the stuff you provide, or if you prefer you
can remain anonymous.  Just don't let the software rot away!

The best reference I can give is what I've done so far.  Just
look at

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

and you'll find hundreds of megabytes of PDP-10 software, preserved in
both *exact* tape or disk image form and as browsable, human-readable
files.  Both commercial software covered by the DEC 36-bit hobbyist
license and the DECUS 10- and 20- freeware collections are available
there.

Part of the problem is that it's nearly impossible to get the
documentation.  But there's more to the equation.

Having written an emulator once, I have a couple comments to make.

Writing an emulator for a CPU is actually quite easy.  But it's
only a tiny fraction of the job.  Writing emulators for the
peripherals also needs to be done, and this can seriously complicate
matters.

Further, you also need to correctly emulate the bugs and undocumented
features.  This sounds inane, but it's true.

When people write code for a specific computer, they don't debug
until the code works according to the specifications of the underlying
hardware, they just debug until it works.  If it happens that
they've stumbled across a hardware bug or undocumented feature,
then the software is very likely to break the first time it's run
on an emulator that does not share this bug or feature.

Here's a real case in point:  On the emulator I wrote, we had a
third party vendor who had a major application.  At one point in
the application, the program ran off the end of executable code
and into a data area, executing the random data as instructions
until it eventually ran into real code again.  As luck would have
it, no disaster resulted.  Otherwise, the vendor would have found
out about the bug and fixed it.

Our emulator reacted differently to this random data due to the
presense of a large number of undefined opcodes.  This caused the
application to crash.  Asking a third-party vendor to fix an
application which ran just fine on the real computer was out of
the question.  Thus, we had to isolate every one of those undefined
opcodes, find out what they did on the real hardware, and emulate
the behavior correctly.  Actually, I won't swear that we got it
all correct -- we just debugged it until it worked.

Every time we thought the emulator was perfected, we found a new
application that tickled some previously-undiscovered undocumented
behavior.

Timing is another problem.  I've heard that there was an early
version of a PDP-10 emulator that was failing under Tops-10 because
emulated disk I/O was happening too fast.

I'm currently working with an emulator for a heavily pipelined
architecture.  Beilieve me, getting all the timings right is a
bear.

Bottom line:  writing a working emulator is non-trivial and a
bastard to support.

Actually, it's not that bad.  Eric Smith has several of the relevant
manuals online at http://www.36bit.org/dec/manual/ , most
notably the "DECsystem-10/DECSYSTEM-20 Processor Reference
Manual".  This is a big win.

The fact that the CPU spec is over 500 pages means that it is a lot
harder than many of the microcomputers commonly emulated.

> Writing an emulator for a CPU is actually quite easy.

It's complicated for at least some of the PDP-10's by the presence
of loadable microcode.

Even more complicated for the PDP-10's with loadable microcode because
most of the microcode versions have subtle bugs, some of which are
used by the software to identify the CPU type :-).

Absolutely.  If you look at the TOPS-10 and -20 sources you can see
that many times the OS writers and the peripheral hardware designers
didn't agree as to how things are supposed to work.  And these are
guys who (at least nominally) were supposed to be working together!

IIRC, this was a spot in ITS (in DSKDMP I think?) under KLH's KS10 emulator
(I heard about it but didn't see it), where it would start a disk I/O
transfer using a buffer which included the code currently being executed,
and then it would jump out of the way before the disk had a chance to start
DMAing stuff in.  But on an emulator, the easiest way to emulate disk I/O
is to suspend instruction execution do the entire I/O "instantaneously"
between instructions, so it would fill the whole buffer before the next
instruction was fetched.

Since it worked fine on real KS10s, this bug is the emulator's problem,
just like the thing you described with executing random data and living
to tell about it.  I had similar problems with my PDP-11 emulator, and
worked around them by putting in a queueing system so that most operations
of most devices can be delayed by a configurable # of instruction fetches
before that operation is begun (at which point it still may happen in a
flash, if it's to a file or device that's accessed using blocking I/O).
It's a big pain but this makes it possible to address the actual problem,
that the user code assumes it can always finish the last N instructions
before a particular spot, before there's any possibility that the device
will have completed (or even begun) the operation.

Anyway, although I've never finished a KS10 emulator, I've done plenty of work
on one and I really think that the instruction set *is* the main concern.
It's freakin' huge!!!  The paging and UMR and interrupt systems have to be
done right too, but they aren't all *that* complicated, at least on the KS.
Some of the devices will be tricky, especially the TU77 since the TM03
documentation is so full of nasty little omissions etc., but generally the
device support in the OSes for the KS10 is terrible so there just aren't
that many devices to worry about in the first place.

Do a TU77 and an RP06 and a DZ and you're practically there!  The KS10 OSes
don't support many of the other zillions of older PDP-11 disk/tape devices
that *would* have worked (the RK611 even has an 18-bit mode, and the RK11D
can be ECOed into an RK11E too), so you can skip all of those, and the KS10
didn't live long enough to really overlap with the newer PDP-11/VAX stuff
(no MSCP at all, and no DELUA, the DEUNA was around but drew too much current
to actually install one).  So you're off the hook for all that stuff too.

AFAIK no serial mux besides the DZ11 was ever officially supported on the KS10
(which is ironic because the KS10 CPU's backplane is actually made from a
DH11 PCB with different wire wrap!), there was the DUP11/KMC11 set that was
used for sync serial I/O but you're probably not going to get much call for
that on a Unix or Windows based emulator.  The DZ is dead easy, so really,
serial I/O is no biggie either.

    I have TONS of old documentation, much to my wife's chagrin.  As
soon as I get my scanner up and running, this is one of my goals: scan
all of that old stuff into a human/machine readable format.  This is going
to have to be a low priority item, but hopefully it'll happen.  When it
does,
and as soon as I can get a new ANONYMOUS FTP account set up,
or possibly WEBify it, I'll make it available.

    Here's another fun point, although it's a software issue: when I was
doing the TCP/IP for TENEX close to 20 years or so ago, I found out
that many versions of TENEX had different JSYS values for certain
calls.  Try to get people to get consistent!  It made it really difficult to
try to put out a unified release for people, without requiring the host
system programmer to perform some hacking, other than the usual
tweaking of values in STORAGE/STG.

Hello Folks:

I read all articles about this subject "PDP-10 Emulator".  Well, there are
existing PDP-10 emulators.   I was able to get my emulator to print "BOOT>"
prompt with KL paging system mode turned on.   My goal is print a dot.

I am writing my KS-10 emulator in progress and am implementing
RH11/TM02/TM03 interface and testing it.   I played with KSBOOT.EXE and it
worked so well and did not crash my emulator. :-)   I entered '/tm02' at a
BOOT> prompt and got result message - "No TM02 or TM03 drive" before I
started to implement my RH11 interface.

Yes, I will release my KS10 emulator under GPL license soon but I do not
know when yet.  Then, I will work on it to expand to KL10 emulator then
PDP6/KA10/KI10 later.   I learned that my monitor sources support KL10 too
but was compiled with KS10 default.  I got them from Tim's archives.  I know
that a sin (fear) controls some authors keep their emulators from people's
hands.

Indeed, my KS10 microcode sources, monitor sources, TOPS-10 sources and
other resources do help my KS10 emulator development so much.

That was my reading of the license also. And my original points about
Digital, contracts, and GPL were in respect of the *emulator* in any
case. Patents and employee contracts and TOPS licences are
*irrelevant*  - nothing to prevent a current or former Digital
employee from lending his or her efforts to an open-source/GPled -10
emulator, and if they have aquired a TOPS license through the 'home
user' agreement, from running it.

Folks,

Well, someone showed me a snippit of XPCW from Stu's emulator.    I fixed
XPCW instruction and a problem disappeared quickly...   I learned that
User/UserIO settings follow caller's flags.   I implemented flag checking
for User/UserIO flag settings.  A problem finally had been resolved.  Three
problems are left now...

However, I am not happy with Stu's emulator because I found out that some
readers on this group have it but refuse to share with new readers who are
looking for PDP-10 emulators.  I asked someone about it.  He showed me GPL
version on it.  I told him that he can distribute it but he refused.  Well,
I still do not have it and look for it forever....

Ok, I will re-write RH11 interface since I received a copy of some
docuements (PDP-11/70 handbook) from someone.  Also, I am developing console
prompts like DDT functions, attach/detach files, etc...

Now I have my own ftp site.  I will put GPL'd pdp-0.1 (pre-alpha) package on
it soon.  I broke files into multi-level directories so that multi-emulator
can be developed like PDP-8, PDP-11, VAX, etc.  I will let you know that.
Thank you for your patience.

I don't know who "someone" is, but he/she is following Stu's wishes in
this regard.

Stu intended at one time to eventually release it under the GPL, and
so some versions of it were given to a few people with GPL notices
in the source file.  But Stu also requested that the recipients *not*
publicly distribute it until he was ready to do an official release.

If you get binaries of it from someone, the GPL requires that they
provide the sources as well.  But Megan is right that the GPL doesn't
require any redistribution.

I'm sure many people would be happy to see a public release of Stu's
code, but it's up to Stu, not a vote of the masses.

I suppose you're talking about Ersatz-11 here.  I guess the thing to ask is,
how much do *you* think a commercial PDP-11 emulator should cost?  How long
do you think it takes to write one?  How much do you think the development
process costs?  How many copies do you think are sold in a year?  How much
support does a typical customer need?  Do you think the sales volume would
be much higher if the price were lower?  Are your expectations realistic?

>Nostalgia ain't worth $2k,

No it sure ain't, whatever the eBay folks may think.  But production-quality
commercial software is not aimed at nostalgic folks.  If all you're looking
for is to feel warm fuzzies about the old days, why aren't you satisfied with
the demo version of E11?  It's free (for non-commercial use), and has all the
main features of the full version.  Sure there are a number of limitations but
it still compares very favorably to the various open-source PDP-11 emulators
are available.  Speaking of which, why don't you just use one of them?  Or
a real PDP-11 for that matter?

>but what I wanna know is who is PAYING that 
>kind of price?

Simple -- any commercial PDP-11 user who knows the following:

- brand new PDP-11/93 used to cost $27K (many older models were even more)
- currently available hardware PDP-11 replacements cost ~$10K-$15K
- E11's only known commercial software competitor costs ~$11K
- E11 costs ~$3K for one copy, much less in quantity, and it's easier
  to use and faster than any of the above -- *very* substantially
  faster than any of DEC's original PDP-11 CPUs
- just for perspective:  most Mentec PDP-11 OSes cost more than E11

E11 is a bargain for serious commercial users.  I've had customers tell me
that they almost passed E11 over because they figured that at such a low price,
it must be a toy.  It costs *far* less than any other alternative open to
them, the only exception being to keep the old DEC hardware limping along with
used parts.  Which is good enough for some users (certainly hobbyists), but
most commercial users have other concerns, like the *guaranteed* availability
of spares, the cost of machine room space and power and climate control for
a large machine, not to mention total system speed, and customer support.

Many times, when a user buys E11, they can move to a smaller office,
terminate the service contract (do you know what those cost?!), and if
anything breaks they can get replacement parts at the nearest mall at 9
o'clock at night.  Plus everything works faster -- for some applications,
a whole order of magnitude faster.  And next year they can make it much
faster still, by buying whatever new AMD or Intel CPU is hot that week for
a few hundred dollars, and popping it in their PC.  And, D Bit's customer
support is better than what many users are used to (same-day bug fixes are
not unusual).  What's not to like?

The commercial version of E11 is not aimed at hobby users, because it's
impossible to pick a price that would be fair to everyone.  At its current
price, it's out of the reach of almost all hobbyists.  It doesn't really
matter by how *much* it's out of their reach.  If the price were lowered to
something everyone could afford, say $50, then even if every active hobby
PDP-11 user in the world bought a copy, I'd be lucky to get a couple of
thousand dollars, TOTAL, for six years' work.  It's a shrinking market,
there's no way to create legions of new customers by fiddling with the price.
Especially not when many/most old-time PDP-11 hobby users find emulators
distasteful in the first place, so they only want to use real DEC hardware,
which you can get for little or nothing if you know where to look.

Greedy, huh.  Have you ever tried to run a business?  I haven't been paid
yet this year, although my tax prep service, lawyer, ISP, hardware vendors,
and print ad folks sure have.  And I sank a couple of $K into upgrading
demo.dbit.com (a fast RSX11M+ system which anyone is free to use) a few
months ago, for which I was rewarded by some bozo breaking in to the system
and installing back doors.  It's taken me over six years to write E11 --
this is not some trivial weekend project, it's over 140,000 lines of code,
and it required piles of expensive DEC documentation to write, plus a *lot*
of hard work on reverse-engineering the undocumented stuff on real hardware.
Which ran into some real money too, for example I paid $3000 for my used
KDJ11EB CPU.  But I was grateful for that deal because the going rate at
the time was closer to $4000.  See how that works?

What's so special about being a full-time emulator author, that I don't
deserve to make a living at it?  Do *you* do your day job for free?

Here's an idea -- why don't you berate existing emulator authors on an
international public forum?  That way, people with the know-how to write a
good PDP-10 emulator for free will come flocking to your door!!!  :-) :-)
Talk about taking a knife in the chest.

Quick buck, yeah.  E11 had four years of development before the first copy
sold, and that was for half price (the old, lower price, where it turned out
I wasn't making money) since it was a beta version.

Jerome Fine replies:

If you are referring to the Supnik emulator from DEC your are
90% correct since it does a really good job, especially if you are using
a UNIX platform.  The source is available, so it can be modified.

Unfortunately, it does not (from my last information - this might have changed)
support MSCP device drivers.

If, as has been inferred, you are referring to the Eratz-11 emulator for the PDP-11
by John Wilson, then I do believe that you are 1000% correct.  In my opinion, this
emulator (BOTH the FREE hobby version and the commercial versions) do a
fantastic job. (see: http://www.dbit.com)

I think that you need to distinguish between the commercial version which would
be extremely reasonable at even double the actual price AND the hobby version
of Eratz-11 which is free.  And since from personal involvement with the use of the
Eratz-11 emulator, I know it is a VERY effective product, I do not understand
why you are complaining.  If you are using Eratz-11 for commercial purposes,
you are welcome to try and find real PDP-11 hardware that you will also need
to maintain.  Not only will it probably cost more to run, but it will be MUCH
slower than using Eratz-11 on current PC hardware (up to TEN times slower
on real PDP-11/93 hardware as compared to a less expensive Pentium III 800).
Since I doubt VERY much if Lord Apollyon will bother to reply to this post, I
hope that this will be the end of his rant.

And if you are really thinking about making a more reasonable complaint about the
hobby version of Eratz-11 which is free, then maybe you should actually target
the cost of the various PDP-11 operating systems.  Mentec/DEC/Compaq do
offer a free hobby license when using RSTS/RSX/RT-11 older versions of these
operating systems (from what I have last heard - is it still available?), but ONLY
when using the Supnik emulator.   If you wish to legally use real PDP-11 hardware
or the Eratz-11 hobby emulator, then the cost of the license/distribution for any
of three OSs mentioned are far more that that $ US 2,000 Lord Apollyon is
complaining about, even though Compaq/DEC is offering a free hobby license for
current versions of VMS.  Why the discrepancy between VMS and PDP-11
hobby license availability?

YES!!  Definitely "How annoying.", but I suspect that you have missed your target
by a VERY  WIDE mark.  The hobby version of Eratz-11 is free.  It is the actual
operating systems on the PDP-11 (RSTS/RSX/RT-11) that still cost those big
dollars except for those very old versions (in the case of RT-11, V5.3 from 1985)
which can legally be run only under the Supnik emulator as opposed to current
VMS versions which Compaq/DEC allow for hobby use on real VAX/Alpha
hardware.

I have seen some references in the past year that Mentec/Compaq/DEC are
contemplating making the hobby license for at least RT-11 (maybe RSTS/RSX
as well) less restrictive.  It might be worth while to point out that while "Compaq/DEC"
does allow current versions of VMS to be used on a hobby basis (well I guess I
have already pointed that out a few times), "Mentec/Compaq/DEC" do not allow
current PDP-11 RSTS/RSX/RT-11 to be used on a hobby basis.  If I look at that
aspect, it should be very easy to note the difference between "Compac/DEC" and
"Mentec/Compaq/DEC".  I suggest that Lord Apollyon try and figure out where the
bottleneck to using current versions of RSTS/RSX/RT-11 on real PDP-11 hardware
lies, let alone on a hobby version of Eratz-11.  Perhaps "Compaq/DEC" do not want
to spend any money on lawyers to make significant changes to the present hobby license
for PDP-11 OSs, but a trivial change which at least allows even an 8 year old version
of RT-11 from 1992 on the Supnik emulator would only need the version number for
RT-11 changed from V5.3 to V5.6 and if "Mentec/Compaq/DEC" were doing that
much, going all the way to V5.7 which will soon be 2 years old in November of 2000
would be even more reasonable if sales of V5.7 have now fallen to a very low level.

In fact, if more hobby users of V5.7 of RT-11 were interested, future commercial
sales might occur for a longer period since there might be a larger support pool
that would still be interested in helping commercial users.  And then again, maybe
not since anyone who is still interested in using RT-11 is likely to already be still
using RT-11 and will not stop just because they don't have a Y2K compliant version
to use.  I suspect that by now, almost everyone still using a non-Y2K compliant version
of RT-11 will continue doing so rather than spending $ US 1600 for a V5.7 distribution.

Does anyone else have any additional comments?

Sincerely yours,

Jerome Fine

Ken Harrenstein (KLH) poppep up on ITS-LOVERS a few months ago, I
believe. He basically said that he's working to get the rights to
distribute his emulator. He also said that he has recently become a

I might also add that in the 25 or so years that I've known him, KLH does
not get involved with flamefests or flamers.  If people start flaming at
him, he just tunes them out.

He's a hell of a nice guy, but judging from the attitudes of certain
people in this newsgroup I'm not surprised that he's kept a low profile.

The original two platforms were SPARC and 68K.  I subsequently ported it
to MacOS and Windows, but I don't think that KLH used that code; it was a
kludgy port anyway (e.g. I do polling on the keyboard).  My compressed
filesystem code was a nice hack, but it's unnecessary these days.

KLH subsequently concentrated on the Alpha because at the time that was
the only system that could emulate a KL at KL speeds or better.

One thing nice about KLH's emulator is that it works on a variety of
platforms.  I've been unable to get Stu's emulator to work on non-Intel.

Worked fine on Alpha/UNIX V3.0 with DEC C V5.something after a few tiny
changes:

1.  Stop deleting *~ in make clean (strictly optional).

2.  setenv ETHER_OBJS ether_bpf.o before configure (pfopen.o comes
    for free in libc.a).

3.  Rename routine pl to pl36 (conflicted with something in libc.a,
    I think).

I'm still here, and still hacking.  It's just slow going.
I took a break from coding when my stepdad was diagnosed with cancer (He
is making a recovery, he's alive and kicking! [swearing and swinging too
^_^]) and I never really recovered from it.

I'm currently toying with a rewrite (Yes, again), this time using pthreads
and other stuff.  The current stumbling block is that I still have no idea
how do handle math, and nobody has a decent explanation of it.  I have it
decoding instructions, and using the console in the normal manner (PI 0
requests, not writing directly into memory).

(Basically, I ran into some DEEP DEEP pits, I forgot to allow for the KL
accounting timers and the ITS XCTR (XCT Relocated) instruction, and a
rewrite currently looks more attractive than the massive surgery a fix
would entail.  I also made some incorrect assumptions as to how the
hardware worked, mostly in the PI system, which would need even more
surgery to fix.)

I'm trying to beat that KS guy to release but I don't think I'll get it... v_v

I also have a copy of kx10, I'm hacking on that too.  When I get stuck on
one, I switch to the other and hack awhile.  (The way they're written is
different enough that I don't have to worry about crossing code.)

E10-KL10, Revision 5, release name "Winter Planet #1".  (I kept forgetting
to change the version number, so I changed it to a name.  Bonus points to
anyone that points out where I'm getting the names from before it gets

Anyway, this code will replace the current E10 Rewrite 2 code, once I get
it up to where R2 is in functionality.  This one doesn't run anything,
it's a release mostly so everyone can see how things fit together, and so

Hello folks:

I studied TOPS-10 7.04 monitor sources for Ethernet but found out that
it supports Ethernet for KL10 only.  How about KS10 processor?  However,
I found KMC-11, DUP-11 and DMR-11 in DNADLL.MAC.   I never heard of them
before.  How do they works?  Are they Ethernet?  I know DZ-11 for
terminals.  I never heard of CD11 before.  What is that?

I studied ITS sources that I got from ftp.swiss.ai.mit.edu. It is under
GPL right now. I learned that it supports Ethernet for KS10 with NI0101
interface.  I learned that NI0101 have three registers only. Is that true?
If not, I am looking for its specs.

None of these are Ethernet.  DUP11 is a synchronous serial communications
interface.  KMC11 is a general-purpose microprocessor (i.e., you download
"microcode" to it, and it runs independently of its host processor), and
saw a lot of use as a communications processor (with something like
a DUP11) to do DDCMP or other protocol processing, to offload that
work from the host CPU.  The DMR11 is a synchronous serial interface
that has its own microprocessor (don't remember if it had downloadable
microcode or not) that could do either DDCMP or SDLC, or both?  (I forget
the exact details....).  There was a prepackaged combination of the
DUP11 and KMC11 you could get for the KS10, and in that configuration the
two boards together were known as a DN20-BA.

As far as I know, the Ethernet support in ITS was never completed and
does not work.  The best chance (almost certainly the only chance, if
you don't want to hack the ITS code itself) you probably have of speaking
TCP/IP from an emulated ITS system is to pretend you are an ACC LH/DH
interface talking to an IMP ....  I'm still trying to find a copy of
the manual for the ACC LH/DH interface, though I have the 4.2BSD driver
for it, and could probably reverse-engineer an emulation from that (in
theory one could do the reverse engineering from the LH/DH driver code
in ITS, but the Unix driver written in C is a lot easier to understand,
IMHO....).

The correct order is DMC, then KMC.
DMC was about a 300ns proc, with 5 option cards (1-4), 1Mb, 500Kb,
250Kb, and 128 or so Kb boards with built in ethernet like nrzi
modulator/demodulators, an (5) the eia rs232/v.35/RS449A interface card.
The KMC is a 180ns or so proc, that can drive any of those cards with
the same microcode, or as the COMM-IOP from CSS, drive sync/async (with
special cards up to 8 lines) OR with the DUP/DZ turn interrupt devices
into DMA devices.  The KMC is a sped up DMC, an IR was added to hold the
instruction for speeding up the ram.  Faster ram, we could have gone
faster.  The IR was my idea.

I think Paul Aluisi did the DMR, after my time, so I don't know all the
specs on it.

The DMC-11 could do both coax at 56K or 1M (DMC11-AL + DMC11-M[AD]) or
serial 232/V.35 (DMC11-AR + DMC11-DA/FA).  The DMR added 422/423/449
serial.  Both had DDCMP in ROM.

KMC-11's are microcoded processors used as commnications processors.
DUP-11's are synchronous serial interfaces. The Unibus Ethernet would
be a DEUNA.

The NI-1010 was a third party Unibus ethernet interface card made by
Interlan. It seems unlikely that DEC would have supported that particular
interface, given that they sold their own (the DEUNA)

Hello Folks:

Thank you for information about KMC-11, CD-11, etc.   I will implement
DEUNA and DZ-11 first soon after I finish to implement RH11 and general
data structure for multi-processing units and multi-level device mapping,
etc.

For DEUNA, I looked into TOPS-10 7.04 sources again and found out that it
was missing UNASER.MAC!  I am looking for its specs that is compatible
with other platforms like VAX and PDP-11.  How about KLNI specs?

That's why I still need TOPS-20 monitor and exec sources for KS-10 and
KL-10 processors because of TCP/IP support, etc.

For ITS, I need NI1010 specs.

Thank you!

The EXEC is just a user program (like a shell).  You don't need EXEC
sources for your emulator, although you probably want some EXEC binary
(along with lots of other binaries) to make it useful to run TOPS-20...

TOPS-20 never supported TCP/IP on the KS10; nor did it ever support
Ethernet.  I made DECnet Phase IV run on the KS (1987 or thereabouts), but
that was using the KDP (KMC11 plus DUP11).  This was as an add on to
TOPS-20 release 4.1.

About 8 or 9 years ago, I spent some time working on getting TCP/IP to
work on the KS10.  I actually got a TCP/IP KS10 monitor built, but it
crashes at startup with a bughlt in the TCP/IP free storage routines.  I
made some efforts to track down the cause, and never did.

TOPS-20 TCP/IP free storage was always a mess, and TCP/IP free storage
bughlts were always the #1 cause of Internet TOPS-20 system crashes.  On
*my* KL systems, they were the *only* cause of crashes, because I had
everything else thoroughly debugged...  :-)  Those damn TCP/IP free
storage routines were great in telling you that the heap was corrupted,
but utterly useless in pointing you at what corrupted it.

TOPS-20 7.0 had a newer IPFREE.MAC than the one that I used for my KS
TCP/IP project, which purports to be a "new version from Stu Grossman".
It still crashed.  I put in some code at the INTFR1 bughlt to check to see
if the clobberaged looked like TCP octets, and if so I sniffed to see if I
could find the block trailer and if so recreate the block header.  This
was sometime in the early 1990s.

There were plenty of other bogons with TOPS-20 TCP/IP, including improper
handling of Telnet protocol (TCOBN didn't do doubling of 0xff bytes from
the application); I fixed this but DEC never adopted the fix.

Hello Folks:

I am suprised to hear that.  I found out that KS10 does not support
network like TCP/IP, etc on both operating system execpt partial support
with ITS for NI1010 interface.  I would end up the network-less
PDP-10 emulator. :-(

Some years ago, I was a student at Gallaudet University.  When they
upgraded TOPS-10 to v7.03 or v7.04.  They installed DECnet on DECsystem10
with PDP10-PDP11 interface box. I tried that and it worked fine.  However,
it have a problem.  When I login into PDP10 from VAX directly for 2nd
session, entire interface box crashed.  Next day, it was back. I tried it
again.  It resulted the same!

Also, I found sources under ANF-10 directory.  They looks like PDP-11
assembly to me.  What is ANF-10?  That is for PDP-10/PDP-11 interface
for DECnet, etc? Right?

Hello Folks:

Sorry for delays because I was so busy and had two classes for Visual
Basic recently.  I finally released my copy to public after I cleaned up
everything.

My PDP10 emulator had not print a dot yet at this time.  I still am
working on it right now.  I am developing my backup routines to read and
write backup routines.  Also disk device routines are not finished yet.

I rewrote my TOPS-20 paging system completely but I had a problem with CST
routines. I looked into TOPS-10 sources and learned that my implementation
is for Microcode v117 but TOPS-10 sources requires least v124.  My TOPS-20
paging systems for V117 is not compatible with TOPS-10 v7.04!  I found
KS10.ULD in bootable tape file and learned that its version was v130
that supports CST on/off routines that v117 does not have.  I put if-then
statement around CST routines to check CBR is not zero.  If CBR is zero,
do not do CST routines.  That's why I am looking for KS10 v130 source
(.MCR or .MCL) file to complete TOPS-20 paging routines, etc.

Also, I implemented disassembly routines to display instructions that had
been executed so that we can understand them clearly and can find a bug
easily.  To to enable debugging, look in pdp10/ks10/cpu.c and changed
to 1 from 0 on "pdp10_debug" at the beginning of its file.

Also, I am figuring out how to discern which address is executive or user
at VMA variable in paging system routines.

To get my open-sourced PDP10 emulator:

ftp://ftp.firesword7.net/dec/pdp10-20000718.tgz

If you fix, modify, add routines, you can send me patches to update.  Yes,
I am learning to be the software developer for first time in my life. :-)

Tim - I'm also very impressed with the work that you've done.

I feel I need to comment, however, on the fact that numerous
symbols, comments and indeed code itself looks like it was
lifted practically verbatim from the emulator I was working
on and had made available.  I have no problem with use of the
code (sincerest form of flattery and all that...) but since some
of the code was developed by me, I would appreciate at least an
attribution...

Megan:

Yeah.  I learned from your emulator alot.  I started to write my
emulator from scratch myself.  Today I compared mine with your emulator
again and indeed noticed that.  Yes, you are right.

However, I now am able write my own code because I was new to how emulator
works.  I will put your credit in my code.

Well, I am emulating a RP06 right now.  I tried TOPS-10 7.03 with it and
it was so happy.  It complained about unknown system pack mounted.
I tried to put 'TOPS-10' at HOM block (173-175).  Now it displayed
"#$%^# system pack mounted - considered off-line". Yes it was garbage.  I
had looked into ONCMOD.MAC in TOPS-10 v7.03 (not v7.04) and learned that
in VOLIPTR (sp?) rountine.  I have change it and will try it later.

Yes, I should put "PS",,"TO" on 173, "0",,"-1" on 174, "",,"" on 175
in HOM block.  I am working on TOPS-10 paging system tomorrow because
FORM Disk Formatter wants TOPS-10 paging, not TOPS-20.  That's why I have
to run it first before install TOPS-10.

RDI routines for bootable devices worked so great! I finally got rid of
KSBOOT.EXE in my emulator directory.  RDI is not same as RIM.  RDI
is the small loader within a block at page 001 (001000) and takes care of
rest of binary within a file to being loaded.  Its information is found in
SMFILE.MAC.  Now I can boot tape files on my emulator! :-)

To create RDI or RIM file, use SMFILE to convert EXE to RDI or RIM
binary.

I did trying to boot TOPS-20 v4.1 installation tape but it complains about
page fails.  I will work on it later.

I suspect RDH could answer this.  I don't see a problem since
ANF-10 was yakking at all kinds of machines.  For all I know,
those guys anticipated TCP/IP and put all the hooks in.
They were real good about stuff like that.

I don't know.  That would be up to CDO to give away.

Hi folks:

I just finished to implement PXCT switches for all instructions that
support PXCT according to PDP-10 Reference Processor manual and KS-10
microcode source code.  I tested it by running varying programs and
operating systems.  They worked fine execpt CORE instruction that still
needs to being fixed for high-segment core allocation (SMFILE.EXE
tried to get 16KW high-seg allocation).

About TOPS-10 v7.03, segementation violation problems on UNIX's side had
been resolved by made big changes in memory access.  I had informed that
its system is ready and await for a dot to login as 1,2 but no a dot
prompt.  I looked into my debug log and noticed series of page fail traps
every address!  However, TOPS-10 v7.04 is running fine - big difference!

About TOPS-20 v4.1, I tried to boot MTBOOT.RDI from its installation tape
but still resulted the same.  That's why I still need its source code to
understand how do it works.  However, I noticed that MTBOOT was searching
for the end of memory to get memory size forever!  Every address, it read
and write its content and check 777777 for any results.  It ended up
an infinite loop. :-(  That's why I still need its source code.
Due to lack of source codes, TOPS-20 is not supported at this time.

About FORM Disk Formattor, it finally worked fine since LUUO routines had
been fixed for correctly return back where LUUO had been executed.
However, my debug log file showed that formattor tried to issue unibus
initialization to reset all devices and controllers on desired unibus
adaptor.  Oh, I forget to implement that!  I will implement that soon.
It tried to issue initialization but it happened nothing.  RHCS2 should be
zero after it wrote dummy unit 7 to RHCS2.

This is actually in my to-do list, after I finish the
universal 18-bit PCB, and debug the FPGA code for the PDP-1 (which is
done) and the PDP-4/PDP-7 (which is all but done).

I have lots of sketches of bits of a PDP-10, most
based on an 18-bit data path, driven by fairly vertical microcode.
Lots of things are worked out, but there are some ugly
parts. There are too many NOPS in some of the key microflows
because there is nothing which can be done in the
microbranch delay slot (it almost all cases the branch is on the
"address translation miss" condition). Multiply and
divide are ghastly because it takes 4 microcycles to shift a
72 bit number in an 18 bit datapath. Most problems
are a result of trying to make the micromachine very simple, and
I think it's too simple.

And I actually didn't implement a DECmate; if I had
been willing to settle for that, I would not have had to build
my own UARTS just to implement non-distructive read from
the keyboard buffer correctly.

Thank you! :-)  I restored CUSP tapes into my emulated RP06 disk
successfully.  It took estimated 15 minutes to complete.  Middle of
restore process asked me to mount next tape and type "GO" to continue.
After 15 minutes, it finally prints ""Done".  It worked so well!

Yes, I am running my Pentium III 800EB processor on my home-built PC (ASUS
CUSL2 motherboard).  Also, I am running my emulator under Red Hat Linux 7.
On my system, my emulator runs at estimated 450 KIPS or 0.4 MIPS.  My
emulator is faster than the original KS10 system (0.3 MIPS).  Also
disk/tape I/O is much faster.  My emulator loaded SYSTEM.EXE from a tape
file and it took a few seconds to complete.

The KS10 emulator runs at 450/500 Mhz Pentium III will equal to the
original KS10 system for speed.  If you have 500 Mhz Alpha processor, my
KS10 emulator will run faster due to 64-bit wide processor.

I am finishing my code soon before it reach a beta version.  I will finish
a few instructons more like FP, DMUL, DDIV, and EXTEND instructions.
Next plan, I will extend to KL10 processor but still am looking for
RH10/RH20 and DTE20 interface register-level functional specifications.

A known bug is still existing - CORE instruction that attempted to assign
high-segment allocation while running SMFILE.EXE.

Hello folks:

Good news!  I finally got rid of some major problems with my emulator since
I implemented trap routines for TRAP1/TRAP2 flags to get rid of "?Illegal
trap instruction" when I tried to copy exe files in NFT program.  I added
a few functions to my RP routines (OFFSET, RETURN, and RECALIBRATE) to get
rid of "HALT 0 at PC 0" messages and returned back to KS10> prompt.  I
fixed BAE settings in RH controller because BAE settings was destroyed after
I/O process so that it resulted "?Transmission Error". (I noticed that it
resulted 177000 instead of 377000 in my debug log file and quickly fixed it.)

I still am working on the minor problems like SMFILE, backup errors when
restore is completed, etc.  I unknownly fixed a hidden bug in shift/rotate
routines when I found out different results from SMFILE program.  That's
why I changed shift/rotate routines to speed up instead of one shift each loop.
For example (ROT instruction):

	count %= 36;
	if (count < 0) count = 36 - count;
	ac0 &= WORD36_ONES;
	ac0 = (ac0 << count) | (ac0 >> (36 - count));

I will work on DMUL, DDIV, EXTEND, and FP instructions soon.  I noticed that
SYSTAT reports big errors for time usage.  I found out that clock interrupt
uses DDIV to update.  At this time, DDIV acts like NOP.

Well, here is screen log:

.TYPE DSKB:[10,7,DECLAR]DECLAR.HLP
[DECLARE.HLP    17-June-1988]

The DECLARE program allows a user to manipulate user-defined commands.

The syntax to define a command is:

        NAME=FILESPEC
or
        NAME/UNIQUE:n=FILESPEC
where "n" can be any of 1, 2, 3, 4, ALL, or NONE, or a list  of  any  of
these values enclosed in parentheses, as in (1,2,4).

or
        NAME/AUTOPUSH=FILESPEC
or a combination of the above.

When a command has been defined, the monitor will from  then  on  search
the user's command table in parallel with the monitor command table.  In
the case of conflicts, exact definitions are given  precedence,  and  in
the  case  of  conflicts  within  this,  the  user's  commands are given
precedence.

In the case of conflicts arising from an abbreviation being  given,  the
monitor  re-searches  its own command table without searching the user's
command table, and if it finds a unique match, it will use it.

A user may define "uniqueness" for a command,  which  the  monitor  will
behave  as  if  the  command had been given an exact definition for that
many characters.

Examples:

        .DECLARE TECO=SYS:STECO
        .TECO   ;Will run SYS:STECO
        .TEC    ;Will run SYS:TECO (Monitor overrides in the case of abb
rev.)
        .TE     ;Will run SYS:TECO
However,
        .DECLARE TECO/UNIQUE:2=SYS:STECO
        .TECO   ;Will run SYS:STECO
        .TEC    ;Will run SYS:TECO (Monitor command has /UNIQUENESS:3)
        .TE     ;Will run SYS:STECO
        .T      ;Will say ?T? since even the monitor commands conflict
And,
        .DECLARE TECO/UNIQUE:(2,3)=SYS:STECO
        .TECO   ;Will run SYS:STECO
        .TEC    ;Will run SYS:STECO
        .TE     ;Will run SYS:STECO
        .T      ;Will say ?T? as before

Note that most programs will only recognize a very  few  command  names,
and  should  be  invoked only with such a command name.  For example, to
run CRSCPY  via  a  command,  the  command  must  be  "CRSCPY"  or  some
abbreviation thereof.

Other options allowed by this program are:

/AUTOPUSH
                When this switch is given on a  command  definition,  it
                causes  that  command  to  do an auto-push, thus causing
                that command to leave the previous  core  image  intact.
                This  feature  is  dependent upon having context service
                (CTXSER) loaded in your monitor.  CTXSER  is  loaded  by
                default.

                However, a command which is run via an auto-push  cannot
                change TMPCOR, pathological name definitions, or command
                definitions for your job.  Thus, many programs will  not
                perform  as  expected  if  they are run via an auto-push
                command.

                Clear all user defined commands.  This is  a  standalone
                switch.

/LIST
                Lists the command names  that  the  user  currently  has
                defined.  This is also a standalone switch.

/KILL
                This switch will remove the  definition  of  a  command.
                This switch also requires a COMMAND NAME.

/SORT
                Sorts the commands that the user currently has  defined.
                Sometimes  this  is necessary due to the way the monitor
                scans the command tables.  This is a standalone switch.

DECLARE name
                Lists the full definition for the command  "name".   The
                command  name  may  contain wildcards, in which case any
                matching   user-defined   commands   will   have   their
                definitions listed.

Hello folks:

Good news! I resolved the problem with page fault handler after I rewrote
my entire page fill routine (pager_Translate) by implementing 
setjmp/longjmp statements to avoid data corruption during instruction
process (messing up acculumators).  When a page fail trap occurs, abandon
instruction process immediately by long-jump back to main CPU loop routine
bypass instruction routines.  Now I was able to run TOPS-10 system so well
execpt ACTDAE that just crashed.  However, I was unable to debug ACTDAE
due to too complication because several INITIA programms are running in
the same time. :-(  With NOINIT option, I was unable to login as 1,2
because it is waiting for DAEMON starting forever.  How do I debug
ACTDAE program with NOINIT option at "startup-option:" prompt?  Look at
log file below.

Also, I tried to boot TOPS-20 v4.1 tape and finally got "MTBOOT>" prompt!
I am trying figure how to boot TOPS-20 v4.1 system...

With TOPS-10 v7.03, I finally got a dot and was able LOGIN as 1,2. Now I 
am looking for MIG 7.03 because MIG 7.04 is very different to 7.03.

Well here is my log file:

KS-10 Processor - 0.3 MIPS.  My KS10 emulator is faster than original
KS-10 on Intel 800 Mhz Pentium III system.

Close enough.

Yes, this was a trick question.  Note that the question specifically said
"slowest machine ever to run TOPS-20"; it did not say "slowest PDP-10."

The slowest machine ever to run TOPS-20 was my Apple PowerBook 100, which
had a 16MHz 68000 processor and 8MB of RAM.  It ran TOPS-20 under an early
version of the KLH emulator at approximately 1/60th the speed of a KS.
[Compare my 100MHz Cyrix (Pentium clone) notebook, which is slightly
faster than a KS.]

As far as I know, that PowerBook 100 was the first notebook computer to
run TOPS-20.  Yes, it was intolerably slow.  I still have that PowerBook
(although it spent a couple years with my step-sister when she was an
undergrad), but I don't run TOPS-20 on it any more.

This also debunked the myth that you couldn't run a demand-paged virtual
memory operating system on a 68000 based system because it had no MMU (and
there wasn't a good one until the 68030).

An 800MHz machine, and you're only slightly faster than a KS?  I get that
class performance on my 100MHz Cyrix clone with the KLH emulator.  Stu
Grossman's emulator is comparable.

I think that after you finish debugging, you should review and find out
what's making your emulator 8-10 times slower than it should be.  I
suspect that it may have to do with how you organize memory.

Yes, but my point had to do with doing demand-paged virtual memory on what
would be roughly the equivalent of a PC-XT.

Hmmmm. I have not implemented cache yet.  With cache, will it be much
faster?  I am trying to bring my emulator faster.  Is KLH's emulator
written in C language?

Without paging system, it is around 0.46 MIPS.  With paging on, estimated
0.32 MIPS.  Hmmm.  With 64-bit variables, I found out that several
instructions per single statement.  With 32-bit variables, just a few
instructions.  Big difference. Hmmm.

I am using GCC compiler v2.95.

Thank you.

I checked with vmstat while I ran my KS10 emulator and vmstat shows 60%
user time and 40% system time. No swap activity.

That is all.

Well, I am changing my emulated instructions to provide a direct access to
AC blocks instead of vRead36/vWrite36 routines.  I made modifications on
MOVE- and SOJ- instructions as initial test.  Then I compiled and ran
my emulator.  It seems worked fine.  My log file show speed improvement.
Est. 20 KIPS gained.  On 450 Mhz system, it almost matches original KS
speed - varying 0.25 to 0.34 MIPS.

Also, I am adding KL10 specification to my emulator to provide all
procesors per configuration, not just KS10 emulation right now.

Hmm. I did not use poll() or select() but my emulator check any key press
by using read(0, &ch, 1) after every instruction.  I am looking for way to
set interrupts when key presses.  Every emulated instructions are
extremely brief because I tried -pg option but its record shows that all
emulated instructions show 0.0 microsecond per call! Yes, DDIV instruction
show 0.0 ms/call! Every instruction finished less than 1 microsec...
However, pager_Translate is one of the most heavy usage - 20% of
my emulator's execution.

Well, I commented out the keyboard poll routines in its function routine.
I compiled and ran it.  I looked into my log file.  Whoa!  My emulator
went into warp drive!  500 KIPS gained!  Now 0.8 MIPS (uncached and
TOPS-20 paging on) from 0.3-0.45 MIPS on the 800 Mhz system!  Now my
emulator slightly outperforms KI10 Processor.  Yes, it beat all processors
execpt KL10 (1.7 MIPS).

Ok, I will implement fork process for I/O bound (includes keyboard poll,
etc.)

Thank you for your help!

A signal handler that sets a volatile flag and dismisses
	+
A test of the volatile flag at the head of the instruction decoder

What's the performance cost of testing a volatile flag, especially
compared to your earlier post about testing a buffer emptiness at
the same place(s)?

(I definitely don't see the advantage of the rest of the suggestion to
create a separate thread that drains the O/S input queue only to fill
an input queue in the simulator, compared to just doing a vanilla read
when the input ready flag is set by the signal routine.  This project
is a PDP-10 simulator, not a user-mode CTY input queue management
system with optional PDP-10 simulation).

And what stops the reader from setting the same flag without messing
with signals?

For one thing, SIGIO doesn't work for pipes. Think whatever you want,
but redirections are Good Thing(tm) and making the thing dependent on
the stdin coming from TTY or socket... not nice. Besides, look at the
API used. Kludges all over the place - fcntl()/ioctl() and signal(). IOW,
the barf-bag. SIGIO _is_ a kludge that happens to work in some cases.
fork() and read() - core API. And yes, processes are cheap, it's UNIX,
after all.

Very unix-centric, aren't we?

Tim, if it's possible, please keep any OS-specific details in
a separate OS-dependent portion of the emulator, to make porting
to non-Unix systems easier.

Of course, we can port my emulator to other platforms like Windows,
OpenVMS, MacOS, etc.

Well, that'll certainly slow you down - it costs you a system call
per emulated instruction.  CTY I/O is very rare (compared to instruction
execution) so it costs you plenty (in terms of time spent) to use
a system call to poll for it each time you go through the instruction
dispatch loop.

>I am looking for way to  set interrupts when key presses.

On FreeBSD and Linux, you can use the F_SETOWN function of fcntl() to
get a SIGIO signal sent to your process when I/O is possible on a
descriptor.  The overhead of catching a signal is high, but it should
be important when you consider how much CTY I/O is done.

If you don't want to do this, then maybe you can still do polling,
but only check for an available keypress once every hundred emulated
instructions or so (i.e., don't do it every time - serial I/O is
comparatively slow, so there's no need to....).

Yeah. I discovered that when I commented out keyboard poll routine!
Whoa.  I changed the front-end routines and removed keyboard poll call
from main loop.  I placed ks10fe_ctyOutput in apr_io function.  Now
0.83 MIPS.  Another speed gain - 20 KIPS increased!

I tried to implement that but it did not work.  It happened nothing when
I pressed some keys. :-(  My new routine:

void ks10fe_Initialize(void)
{
   emu_IOTrap = ks10fe_ctyInput;
   if (fcntl(fileno(stdin), F_SETOWN) < 0) 
      perror("STDIN 1");
   if (fcntl(fileno(stdin), F_SETFL, O_ASYNC) < 0) 
      perror("STDIN 2");
}

It was executed successfully. No error reports but it happened nothing!
Yes, I put signal(SIGIO, emu_IO) in main.c to call keyboard input routine.

Here is "sigio.c", which works on SunOS4, FreeBSD, and Linux
(from an 8051 simulator I wrote);

#include <unistd.h>			/* STDIN_FILENO */
#include <signal.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

void
sigio(int x)
{
    puts("SIGIO");
}

main() {
    int fl;

    signal(SIGIO, sigio);
    if (fcntl(STDIN_FILENO, F_SETOWN, getpid()) < 0) {
	perror("F_SETOWN");
	exit(1);
    }

    fl = fcntl(STDIN_FILENO, F_GETFL, 0);
    if (fl == -1) {
	perror("F_GETFL");
	exit(1);
    }
    if (fcntl(STDIN_FILENO, F_SETFL, fl|FASYNC) < 0) {
	perror("F_SETFL");
	exit(1);
    }

    puts("type return");
    pause();
}

And here is how you do it on SVR4 STREAMS systems (SunOS5, IRIX);

#include <unistd.h>			/* STDIN_FILENO */
#include <stropts.h>
#include <signal.h>

void
sigpoll(int x)
{
    puts("SIGPOLL");
}

main() {
    int fl;

    signal(SIGPOLL, sigpoll);
    if (ioctl(STDIN_FILENO, I_SETSIG, S_INPUT) < 0) {
	perror("I_SETSIG");
	exit(1);
    }

    puts("type return");
    pause();
}

This is probably killing you.  I've looked at the source for Stu
Grossman's emulator and while it's written fairly carefully, it
doesn't go to great lengths to bum cycles.  It's written in
straightforward C.  I bet that with careful tuning and maybe some
inline assembly code here and there, it could run twice as fast on an
x86 as it currently does.  On the other hand, I think it's not nearly
as far along as your emulator in simulating the 10's i/o devices etc.

See the fcntl(2) man page for info on getting a SIGIO interrupt when a
key is hit (use F_GETSIG), or you could look at the GNU Emacs sources
to see how it's done.

System calls are expensive.  I'm sure everyone will point out that you
need to use asynchronous I/O.  But as an intermediate step, you might
try doing your read() call only on simulated branch instructions.  In a
simulator I wrote (for something other than a PDP-10), this proved to be
quite effective.  Another option is to poll I/O after every "n"
simulated instructions, for some reasonable value of n.

> However, pager_Translate is one of the most heavy usage - 20% of

Try keeping the results of the latest translation, and having
pager_Translate first see if it can reuse that.  This is effectively
a single-entry TLB.  If that helps, you might want a few entries.

Or you could use a 512-entry TLB, one entry for every virtual page
(of a single-section PDP-10).  This is more efficient than an
intermediate-sized TLB since you can simply take the top nine bits
of the address as the TLB index, rather than having to search a

Well, thank you for information. KS10 emulation is near finished and will
be released soon.  Thank you for you patience.  I already started to work
on KL10 so that save some of my developement time.

Only one problem is remaining - Quasar daemon that crashed on my emulator
and it is much difficult to debug with running Quasar daemon.  That's why
I need stand-alone system to test it. If I was unable debug that, I will
still release my emulator soon and let others to work on it.

This is why you need to make clear what your intentions are.
I think I've figured out your work pattern, but people like
the above poster are assuming that the work pattern is 
completely different.

I thought you were using a PC.  Is it possible that you 
misunderstood my reference to stand-alone?

You might have to do just this.  I can't seem to be able
to even teach keystrokes without being able to do them.
Debugging GALAXY was just as complicated as debugging the
monitor.  To hear Larry talk about it when they were writing
the beast, it was more difficult.  Since I can't really
see how terminals are set up on your "system", I haven't
been able to figure out how, let alone tell you how.
Getting symbols in that software is a first step, but 
you need to be able to build the thing...yeah, yeah, Mark,
no need to rub it in :-).

That CAI<mumble> stuff is the SIXBIT 3-character crash code 
that gets appended to "GLX".  Sometimes, I can still dream PDP-10.

It doesn't matter HOW fast the KLH or Grossman emulators are if noone

releasing his emulator to the public, and I'd infinitely rather have
a slow emulator than no emulator at all.

Not necessary - you may very well end up with smaller active set and
unless you get too horrible overhead in icache you can actually win.

JMF used SYSDPY with CDO's changes in them.  This stuff was
not shipped with any of the 6.03 stuff so you'll have to
look for it on the 7-series tapes.  And I put all of that
stuff on the Customer Supported Tape.  

Now, IIRC, and my brain is hazy this week, SYSDPY can output
data that another program written by Chuck (in FORTRAN?) takes
as input and pretties up a display.  JMF also seemed to be
able to learn a lot just by staring at SYSDPY running.  He
spent hours staring at the screen.  Getting  SYSDPY to work
on your terminal may not be a trivial task and would be a 
really good hack project to assign to somebody else.

I volunteer, FWIW.

I always loved SYSDPY. 

We had a locally produced Tandberg display terminal running a hacked
version of SYSDPY in the operator room at UiO, and I was totally
amazed at the level of detail of the information it gave us, and
how much it let us know about the wellbeing of the system.

I haven't touched DDT since '86, and it is starting to show. :)

All of our consoles would finish up with a running SYSDPY.

I'll warn you now.  I closed my eyes and tried to envision how
I debugged the ACTDAE and couldn't find the line feed key.  
Remember how SYSDPY had all those magic twanggers for commands
that would change the display screen?  I don't know if the
equivalent <ctrl>character will work.  For all I know, which isn't
much, two characters get shipped.

Yeah. I resolved its problem.  Now my emulator runs at up to 1.3 MIPS on
800 Mhz system. Now - 3 to 4 times faster than a KS.  Also, I am working
on them to improve some performance.  Its problem was keyboard poll
routine.  It had been major-changed.  Whoa. Old keyboard poll routines
stole 2/3 of its performance!

Thank you for let me know.  No one let me have Stu's or KLH's emulator to
compare with my emulator for performance.

Except he's confusing you.  7.04 is a monitor version...not
a CUSP version.  The only reason that the two are tied together
is because we found it easier to field test and ship updated CUSPs
with a monitor development cycle.  And it took us 15-20 years
to figure that all out.

V7.04 was the release I was working on when I got sick.  
I had heard that there was a final release that the
idiots called V7.05 when it really should have been
V7.04A since it was only a maintenance release.
Now, it certainly wouldn't surprise me to learn that
they only submitted this final set of tapes to SDC
with no distribution.  It would have been typical of
their thinking.

Joe, you've got the naming conventions all wrong.  If the KC had
been shipped, the version of the monitor supporting that piece
of hardware might have been 7.03 since we were working on the
7.02 ship when the project got killed.  It would have never
been 7.05 since that version would have been shipped after
7.04.  The date for 7.04 was 1987...or was it 1986...four
years after the Jupiter.

I doubt it.  The -10 software guys weren't working on it at all.

Hello folks:

Thank to Phil for examples about keyboard I/O async.  I removed keyboard
poll routine from main loop where is executed after every emulated
instruction.  It reduced its performance greatly.  I learned a lesson
about that.

Now I break a routine into two routines (one for input and one for
output).  I put a output routine in the emulated WRAPR instruction (within
Set selected flags block) and wrote SIGIO interrupt routine to call
a input routine during fe_Initialize routine.  Following an example from
Phil's posting, I implemented three fcntl statements with error checking.
Also, for fe_Cleanup, I implemented three "inverted" fcntls.

I compiled and run it.  It worked greatly and finally accepted my key
presses. Yeah. I noticed that TOPS-10 execution is much faster than
before!  I looked into my debug log file and was so impressed.  On 450 Mhz
system, it is varying 0.47 to 0.84 MIPS. It was 0.15 to 0.33 MIPS before. 
I believe that my emulator could break 1 MIPS barrier on 800 Mhz or above
system.  I believe that pager_Translate reduces its performance 1/3 times.
I would implement a cache to test performance, etc.  My goal is match KL10
speed or faster.

Yeah. On my 800 Mhz system, it was 0.60 to 1.3 MIPS.  My emulator did
break 1 MIPS barrier.  Yes. my emulator now is 2 to 4 times faster than
a original KS10 machine but almost match KL10 speed.  To beat KL10 speed,
you might need least 1 Ghz Pentium. :-)

The KL10 uses a DATAO instruction to the "PAG" device to invalidate
the TLB.  On a KL10 with an MCA25, they've added a K ("Keep") bit to
the section and map pointers, and it's possible to selectively invaliate
only the TLB entries not marked "Keep".  The motivation of the Keep bit
is presumably to avoid invalidating translations of resident monitor pages.

The KS10 probably works similarly, although I don't think it has the
Keep bit.

The documentation for both processors is present in the DECsystem-10/
DECSYSTEM-20 Processor Reference Manual, available in a 36.2 megabyte
PDF file from my web site:

	http://www.36bit.org/dec/manual/

I don't think the PRM documents the Keep bit though.  I only in the
last few weeks found a manual with an appendix documenting the MCA25.

Hello folks:

Well, my tuning for performance was just finished.  On 800 Mhz, my
emulator reached 3.74 MIPS(!).  When I ran TOPS-10 on my emulator.
Whoa! TYPE command is too fast for me to read.  Entire document file
displayed within a second.  When I pressed CR at "BOOT>", entire
TOPS-10 was almost instantly loaded within a second.  When I typed SYSTAT,
information was displayed and scrolled almost instantly.

Also, I fixed my new I/O keyboard async routine when I discovered that
some characters were lost while TOPS-10 asked my terminal for
indentification. It cause the CTY derailement and misalignment.  After it
was fixed, TOPS-10 finally recongized my terminal as VT102.

Well, I will finish up my rest of instructions for switch to direct-acces
to AC blocks and EXTEND instructions before release to public. Then I will
work on rest of PDP-6, KA, KI, and KI then VAX and PDP-11, etc....

Whew.

Hello folks:

I fixed some math problems in my emulator because they produced incorrect
values.  That's why you noticed weird values in time, etc. when I posted
my screen log files.  Well, I ended up negated time but mentioned correct
values.  It reported only 2 seconds of CPU time usage when I executed 'kjob'.

Also, I still have some problems with Quasar daemon.  It randomly complained
about errors - "Illegal UUO in PC 000000", "No such PID", and "Unknown node
name" each boot time.  I still am working on it and wrong-sign values.

On 800 Mhz, MIPS meter was up to 3.8 (with debug facility), and up to 4.5
(without debug facility).  I tested it without running X-Windows but it
resulted the same.  My emulator now is estimated 8 to 10 times faster than
my previous one with time/poll every instruction.  It destroyed 9/10 of
its performance!

I returned home from my thanksgiving vacation.  Well, my employer is
strictly Microsoft customer but I am using Red Hat Linux on my second
desktop PC to develop my KS10 emulator.  Using UNIX operating system is
good for software developement if you just know C/C++ language.  It is
more difficult to develop software on Microsoft products.

Soon I will resume to continue developing my KS10 emulator to complete.

Real soon but I do not know when yet.  I returned home from my vacation.
I will resume to develop my KS10 emulator to complete.  EXTEND, DMUL, and
FP instructions are not implemented yet.  A bug in my emulator that cause
galaxy daemons to crash is like finding a pin in the entire earth. :-(

On DDT, when I pressed '.', it instantly displayed "KA10 floating
instruction"...  That means FP instructions not implemented yet.

I tested my emulator on my Pentium II/400 Mhz laptop.  It was up to 1.8
MIPS. On Pentium III/800E, it was up to 4.5 MIPS.

Yeah. Good idea. If you run my emulator on Alpha, it will be faster
because of 64-bit arch Alpha CPU.  I need to find ethernet func specs for
unibus (designed for VAX and PDP-11 computers).

I already ran it on my Cray-like PC -- Pentium III/800E system. :-)

DMUL instruction had been implemented. Boot routine for RP/RM disk drive
is being implemented according to SMFILE.TXT.

Hello folks:

Well, I tried compile teco.mac into teco.exe file.  It was so successful
but LINK attempted to exit but "Illegal Memory Reference" displayed
instead. I believe that it happened during context switch or so.  It
contains BLT 17,17 instruction according to my log file.  Well, I am
trying figure this out later.

I tried two different methods for compilation.  First method is using
COMPILE command.  Second method is using R MACRO command. You can usei
either.  I included both methods for compilation here.

It produced CREF file and resulted a neat listing. :-)

I was so impressed to read it.  Yes. my emulator runs much faster than
a real PDP-10 on Pentium III 800EB system.  If you run my emulator on
Pentium IV 1.4 or 1.5 Ghz or Itanium (sp?), my emulator runs
faster more than 10 times than a real PDP-10.  On 800 Mhz system
my emulator runs 10 times faster (4 MIPS) than a real KS.

Hello folks,

Good news!  I found a BLT 17,17 bug in my emulator that was responsible
for GALAXY crashes, etc... But I now have another GALAXY-related problem.
Now ACTDAE is complaining about stopcode WFO messages.  After a BLT
17,17 bug had been fixed, some bugs disappeared within GALAXY daemons.
QUASAR sometimes crashed with "?Illegal UUO at user PC 000000".  This
screen log showed that QUASAR did not crash yet.  Some times, QUASAR did.

I discovered that a BLT 17,17 always overwrote stack pointer when
a block transfer was complete.  When I attempted to boot TOPS-20 v4.1,
it constantly displayed STKOVF fatal error messages. I decided to look
into my debug log file and discovered that!

Also, LINK was attempted to exit but it crashed at location 45.  It
was a BLT 17,17 instruction too.  When it was fixed, now LINK normally
exits.

MOVEKEY

? Stopcode - WFO - WTO Function in S1 out of range at address PRMADR
  Program ACTDAE 2B(155) + GLXLIB 5(1601) error at PC 653015 in module GLXINT
  Last GLXLIB error at PC 632245 was 11; File not found
  Crash block begins at 674000
  [Stopping program]

Does anyone know about stopcode WFO message?  Where did MOVEKEY
come from?  I tried to run ACTDAE again but it displayed the same
message. ACTDAE always crashed with that same message.

Thank you!

Barb:

Yeah. You are right about sharable high-segement.  I discovered that all
INITIA programs used same shared high segement too.  I tried to get
and save it.  It resulted the same.  Oh, I forget to SET W V F.  At end of 
screen log, I did SET W V F to trace ACTDAE's access to files.
Hmm. SCDMAP.SYS is not existing that cause ACTDAE to crash possibly.
No, QUASAR did not crash on my 800 Mhz system.  If 450 Mhz system,
QUASAR sometimes crashes. 

Thank you!

Mark:

Yes, CHKHOM had been executed on my emulator.  With debug ioregs and
iodata turned on, it looks like that CHKHOM tried to access my emulated
RP06 disk.  It checked registers first but quietly gave up without
reading blocks from my disk image.  Also, an interrupts occured every
second to check disk drives for status.  My debug log showed that.
Look at three log files below for more information.

Well, my TS-10 emulator will support all PDP and VAX processors, not
just KS10 processor. I will release initial KS10 emulator when I was able
to run TOPS-10 v7.04 and TOPS-20 v4.1 operating system without any
problems.  Also, I already worked on KL10 implementation as well.

I still need KS diagnostics package to test all instructions first before
I release my KS-10 emulator.  I have it but I have a problem with it
because it wants running TOPS-20 operating system (did not recongize
TOPS-10 filesystem).

Yeah. I am aware of that.  I am using -DKS10, -DKL10, etc. to compile
separately.

Hmmm. A few instructions are left to complete KS-10 implementation. 
Double-precision floating points and some EXTEND instructions are to go.
All signle-precision floating instructions had been implemented recently.
TOPS-10 v7.04 was running fine execpt Galaxy daemons. Also, I found and
fixed a few bugs in PI and RP06 that blocked TOPS-20 from being booted.

Also, today I rewrote XMOVEI and XHLLI instructions for both KL10 and
KS10.  I separated old code (SETMI and HLLI) from that for KA10 and KI10
by using -DKx10 suboptions.

Hello folks:

Good news! I found three bugs in my emulator blocked TOPS-20 v4.1 from
being booted.  First bug is in my emulated RP06 disk routines.  I
forget to put RPCS1_DVA in RPCS1 registers when disk drive routines
had been initialized or reset.  I used EDDT to set UDSKIO breakpoint
and turned trace on in my emulator then pressed esc-p to continue.
Then I looked into my debug log file carefully.  I noticed that 
it checked if DVA bit is on.  If not, it did nothing with disk drives.
If set, it will read blocks from RP06 disk.  That bug had been fixed.

When I compiled and ran my emulator again but it returned back to
KS10> prompt without any error report.  I turned debug interrupts on
and ran it.  I found out that it attempted to issue vector interrupt
to KS10 processor.  It ended up wrong location that contains complete
zero word.  It cause HALT for illegal interrupt instruction.  
I fixed first bug to report error correctly.  I compiled and tested
it.  Now it reports illegal instruction (where and its content).

Now I fixed another bug in the same routine quickly.  I changed from
pRead36 to vRead36 with executive mode to fetch interrupt instruction
correctly.  Another two bugs had been fixed.

I compiled it again and run it.  TOPS-20 v4.1 finally printed a message!
Whew!

Mark, what next?  I need instructions to how to install TOPS-20 v4.1
system.

Thank you!!

Hello folks (and Mark):

Ok. When I tried to answer to first question but TOPS-10 only received
first character and ignored rest of my data.  Yes, I quickly found a bug
in my FE routines.  I found out that TOPS-20 did not clear location CTYIWD
completely but just turned off valid bit.  That cause my FE routines to
locked up forever but did not affect rest of my emulator.  My FE routine
checked if CTYIWD is zero word, then put character from keyboard into that.
I fixed a bug by changing routine to check if valid bit is reset before
go ahead to put character on it.  Otherwise, put character in queue that is
waiting for next available space in CTYIWD.  Now TOPS-20 was able accept
all of my data right now...

Also, I ended up another problem when my FE routines stalled middle of 
questions.  I found out that character interrupt failed.  I fixed a bug
quickly by re-send character interrupt if TOPS-20 failed to clear valid
bit in CTYIWD after countdown (in my FE queue routines).  A problem went
away.

Well, I ended up BUGHLT "BTBCRT".  Well, I have BUGSTRINGS.TXT that
was found in that same TOPS-20 installation tape.  It means "Can't
initialize bit table for public structure."  Mark, do you know about
that?  What is solution?

My debug log file showed that TOPS-20 loaded MONITOR.EXE from a tape and
put it into my emulated RP06 disk file then updated BAT blocks.  Then
BUGHLT message disaplayed!

Thank you!

Excellent!  All is well!!

INTERRUPT AT 0 basically means that the top-level process for the job got
an error at PC 0.  Since the top-level process for the job at this point
is totally empty with no initial PC and no memory, that's what would
happen.  In other words, at this particular point, that's what is supposed
to happen.

MX> is the prompt for the mini-EXEC.  TOPS-20 has a miniature command
decoder built into the kernel.  Unlike TOPS-10, where the entire command
decoder is in the kernel, the TOPS-20 mini-EXEC only has a few commands
and is only accessible by privileged users.

Assuming that you have the installation tape mounted, here is what you do
after a 143 start, filesystem create, and entering the mini-EXEC.  Note
that <return> means the return key.

1) Type "GMTA0:<return>".  "GET FILE MTA0:" is echoed followed by another
   MX> prompt.

2) Type "S<return>".  "START" is echoed.  You should now be in the TOPS-20
   command decoder (EXEC).

So now you know two mini-EXEC commands, G and S.  There are three or four
others which we can discuss later (you don't need to know them for now).

3) At the "@" prompt, type "ENABLE<return>".  You should now have a "$"
   prompt.  You need to have your privileges enabled for the next step.

4) Type "MTA0:<return>".  This should give you the "DLUSER>" prompt.

5) Type "LOAD MTA0:<return>".  Wait for it to finish and give you another
   "DLUSER>" prompt.

6) Type "EXIT<return>".  You should be at the "$" prompt.

7) Type "MTA0:<return>".  This should give you the "DUMPER>" prompt.

8) Type "TAPE MTA0:<return>".  You should get another "DUMPER>" prompt

9) Type "RESTORE<return>".  It should say something like "LOADING FILES
   INTO PS:<SYSTEM>" (or some other directory).  If it does not say
   "LOADING FILES", let me know what it does say.

10) Repeat step 9 until you reach end of tape.

When a Field Circus engineer had to run diags on a KL (for example), he would
run a special task under RSX-20F, called DBOOT.  This would in turn read
commands from the console, or take them from .CMD files with informative names
like B.CMD and BT.CMD.

If you look at those, you will find that the former runs a string of 11-based
diagnostics to check out the physical state of the KL, while the latter runs
the instruction set diags if the KL passes the B string.

The .CMD files of course refer to .A10 and .A11 files, but you can substitute
the .SAV files and run each one individually, in the order they occur in the
BT string.  Under Tops-10.

Barb:

I re-installed TOPS-10 v7.03 software.  I corrected file protections on
SYS:.  I changed to <055> from <057> on all SYS: files.  However,
I did entered 'PROTECTION 055' before 'RESTORE SYS:=*.EXE,...'.
Then I made DSKB: bootable by running SMFILE.  I rebooted system from
RPA0: directly without any problems.

Good news! What guess? GALAXY daemons are running fine on TOPS-10 v7.03.
But not on v7.04.  Still problem with ACTDAE.  I checked with it but
just "MOVEKEY" but no fatal errors.  Only I have a problem with
OPR and REACT programs.  When I entered commands on OPR> and REACT>
prompt, I received no response - just sat forever.  I had to press ^C
to get rid of it.  Ok, I will send you a copy of ACTDAE.MAC that you
request soon.

Ok, I looked into my debug.log that my emulator produced.  Hmmm.
No page fault trap messages!  That's why GALAXY daemons did not crash.

I tried to assign MTA0: on BACKUP when GALAXY daemons are running, they
rejected my request!  I was told that MTA0: is not available.
How do I make MTA0: accessible and available?

Now, I will work on KLAD diagnostics to test my emulated instructions.

Hello folks:

I was trying to run simple SMBC2 to see if it worked or now.  Yes,
it worked so well! :-)  First time, I tried to run it and got
HALT message.  It said "?HALT instruction at user PC 21503".  I looked
into SMBC2.SEQ file and found out that SOS instruction failed to set
CRY0/CRY1 flags.  I fixed my emulated SOS instruction in my
emulator by changed from 'if (*ac0 == -1)' to 'if (*ac0 != -1)'.
I recompiled it and tried it again.  SMBC2 normally exit without
any HALT messages.  That means some basic instruction test had been
passed.  I will work on other stuffs to test more instructions...

That was tested on TOPS-10 v7.03.

[From "Origins and Development of TOPS-20" by Dan Murphy]

     Stanford wasn't the only other place where a PDP-10  architecture
machine  was  being  designed  and built.  The newly opened Xerox PARC
(Palo Alto Research Center) included a number of people from  BBN  and
other  sites  familiar  with  TENEX, and they were quite interested in
pursuing their work on that system.   Since  Xerox  was  then  in  the
computer  business,  PARC  couldn't  quite manage to just buy a PDP-10
from  DEC.   Consequently,  they  built   their   own.    It   was   a
single-processor  machine  compatible with the KA10 and BBN paging and
was designed and built in a relatively short time.  It ran TENEX for a
number of years.

Mark:

Good news!  I finally got a @ prompt much like a dot on TOPS-10 operating
system.  Well, I found another bug in my emulator that cause executation
derailment during PXCT instruction's presence and page fault traps.
I fixed in page fault trap handler in my emulator by adding 'pager_PC'
to save PC before execute instructions because PC might be incremented
sometimes.  If so, it cause executable derailment by missing a re-trying
instruction when page fault trap occurs.

However, I ended up another bug that I kept repeating same BUGCHK
messages 4 to 5 times each second.  I fixed it in prority interrupt
routines.  Since I already implemented CTY input delay (100 instruction
countdown), no longer lagged etc...  After I removed a patch that
re-send PI request for channel 1, I no longer received annoying
repeating BUGCHK messages that complaint about unexecpted interrupt on
channel 1.  Whew.

Also, another BUGINF messages showed up about MTA0: problems. I will work on
it right now.

In particular, as Timothy alluded, SYS:ACTDAE.SYS is an RMS ISAM file.

The last I read, the simulator doesn't implement EXTEND instructions.
Maybe a MOVSLJ took a left at Albuquerque.

However, MOVEKEY is the name of an RMS routine; I just don't know what
file it's defined in (too many RMS files to guess easily).  How that
string appears though, I just don't know.

And I assure you that RMS did not use the BLISS that was
corporately designated as BLISS-36.  We were not allowed to
ship that EXE except on the DECnet tapes so we could soak
customers for big bucks.  

RMS would have not got on the CUSP tape with my also shipping
its building tools.

And I'm telling you that RMS-10 was written when there wasn't
a BLISS-36 mess around.  We did not get BLISS-36 until we
started to fool with DECnet.  That was way after RMS-10 got
shipped.  If there was such a file yakking about BLISS-36,
I have no idea who did it because there wasn't any developement
done on RMS...only bug fixes.  Period.  The only thing I can
think of is that somebody messed with RMS when the ACTDAE was
done, and that's even worse because, not only did BLISS-10 and
BLISS-36 generate differing code, but interim edit updates
of BLISS-36 would generate different code.  Mixing these all
up is going to cause a headache so big that all work will stop.
The only way we (TOPS-10) monitor managed to get DECnet Phase
IV out was by doing our own freeze of the crap and ignoring 
the north.  

I may be hazy on programming the -10, and hazy on debugging
but I am an expert on building and packaging the software
that was shipped out of the TOPS-10 monitor group.  The
language group beat to a completely different drummer.  And
the TOPS-20 monitor group has a mess until they had a
software engineer working full time on packaging.

Hardware diagnostics?  Unless that departement drastically

Which boot code?  Not the microcode.  Diags had to run on
a cold machine.  Or else field service would have had
to do it the hard way and use scopes.  Diags were also
a maintenance tool for field service.

You are assuming that the checksum code also worked :-).
All we proved was consistency.  Hint:  The restore could
have equivalent problems; all we proved with that checksum
is that, if there are problems with generating code
and writing the disk, they're all behaving alike.

And we've only half exercised MACRO.EXE, let alone the 
monitor functionality.

The problem is that he doesn't have a really good idea how
to do and look at a BLT from the PDP-10 side.  He knows 
how to look at it from his emulator side.  Now, we know
how to look at it from the -10 side but we need a -10
to do the test <grin>.  We are in a great CTCH22.  I am
now dreaming teaching techniques to Tim.  So I'm getting
into the swing...now if I could only remember without
a gazillion parity errors....

Yeah. He is.  I know inner workings of bootable tape so well.  There are
512-byte blocks with a few tape marks before BACKUP-based blocks.  First
blocks are for FE loader.  I used my own routines in my emulator to load
RDI loader into my emulator's memory then transfer its control to the
loader to load rest of stuffs to complete transfer.

That's why I hold a B.A. degree in computer science from my university
(Gallaudet University).

Barb:

I successfully completed TOPS-10 v7.03 installation.  I can do
multi-restore once:

RESTORE SYS:=*.EXE,*.VFU,*.RAM,TECO.ERR,HLP:=*.HLP,DOC:=*.DOC,.....

It worked so well for me.  I checked SYS:, HLP:, etc... They looks like
so good! Then I made DSKB bootable by running SMFILE.EXE.  When it is
done.  I rebooted system and was able boot DSKB: directly.  After
I entered "GO" on Startup prompt, I ended up "Lookup error 2" then a dot.
I tried entered "LOGIN", etc.. I kept told same message - Lookup error 2.
What is that for?  Yes, I made a backup copy first before I tried.

Thank you!

I'll be happy to repost it, but if any of you have done
modifications I should integrate those first.

Otherwise it seems we are duplicating work here.

The E10 can get through DAKAA almost right off the last distribution.
I also got down to DAKAB, found two instruction blopers, and
some bit alignment problems I could work around with an OR
during memory storage. 

Midway through DAKAC there are some logic/alu bit shift/tests
that bring out large problems with the whole math implementation.

So the status seems to be :

== Instruction semantic correctness seems almost there.

== Integer/ALU and flag handling needs an overhaul. Are there
   any 10s left where we could test exact flag behaviour with
   DDT?

== Floating point also seems to work, but I suspect some
   bombs there as well; and we can't do  those tests before
   DAKAC stops bombing. We could use the host hardware for FP; 
   and just do translations of the FP format on load/store if
   this becomes a problem.

Ports? I run the emulator on FreeBSD 4.0-STABLE, 2.7-STABLE, 
RedHat 6.2 and Mandrake 7.0 with no problems at all. CPUs vary from
486 to PIII@800Mhz. I just wrote 'make' on all of them.

Yes, I do have some portfolio of machines at home and at work.

Hello folks:

Good news! I finally got rid of "MOVEKEY" in ACTDAE daemon after I fixed
CMPS string instruction.  When I reviewed my Opcode_EXTEND routine,
I was shocked to notice that 'DO_JUMP(PC)' at case EXT_SKIP within
switch statement!  I changed to 'DO_SKIP'.  I recompiled it and noticed
big difference in ACTDAE's behavior!  Yes, "MOVEKEY" finally disappeared
from my screen!!  Also, I got stopcode AFF message - Accounting Initialization
Failure.  Then I fixed some bugs in CMPS series instruction.  ACTDAE finally
runs smoothly without any problems.  Also look at GALAXY daemons no more
crashes anymore after I fixed PUSH*/POP* instruction.  They ended up a big
mess during page fault traps.

Yeah. Thank to KLAD sources package because I was able to fix many bugs
by using KLAD.  My emulator is becoming reliable more and more...

However, I have some problems with REACT and LOGIN.  When I attempted
to log into system as [1,2], I was told that invalid login entry.

.login 1,2
Job 2  KS10	  CTY
?LGNIET Invalid entry
#

Does anyone know solution about that by fixing that?  Also, I was
unable to access OPR> prompt because of ACTDAE or so.

Thank you!

Hello folks:

Yeah. KLAD sources package are so useful for debugging the PDP-10
emulator.  Yes, I still am working on my emulated EXTEND instructions
like CMPSx, CVTDBx, CVTBDx, EDIT, and MOVSx instructions.

Thank you!

Barb,

Yes, you are right about terminal I/O routines.  I just tested how terminal
I/O routines behave by using OPR and REACT programs.  I discovered that
that problems are clearly reproductive.  I played my keyboard by pressing
every key.  I found out that ^X, SPACE, and @ characters are "break signal"
to wake them up to process my commands.  I believe that terminal I/O
routines misinterpret SPACE and @ characters as break signal instead
of ^Z and CR characters.  When I pressed CR keys three times then
SPACE key, I got three OPR> prompts printed.  When I tried four CR keys
then SPACE key, I got four OPR> prompts too.

Also, I tried four ^Z keys then ^X key at text input prompt, I got OPR>,
OPR exit, and a two dot prompts. Then "? ^X" message.

I looked into OPR source code and traced to K%TXTI routine in GLXKBD.MAC
source in GLXLIB directory.  It uses ECHO and SETMSK routines.  I set watch
in IDIVI and LSH instruction in my PDP-10 emulator but... My debug log file
showed that K%TXTI correctly interpret ^Z key as break signal, etc.  I
can't find any problem with them! :-(

I tried DDT but I was told that ECHO, etc are unknown symbols so that
I can't debug it without symbols.

Well, however, I noticed that long execution after each SPACE key pressed
but it does not show SPACE key as break signal mask during ECHO or so
routine.  I believe that terminal I/O buffer is not in sync with OPR's
input buffer.  That bothers me so much.

No, I do not use the same buffer for both input and output. I use
separated stream buffer for input and output each.

Barb,

I used my emulator to produce results from EXTEND instructions.  Also,
I found a possible bug near or around EXTEND instruction.  AC #1 had
a bad byte pointer that produced a corrupted string (for username field).
I still am looking for a specific bug near MOVSLJ instruction or so.

Also, I just tested REACT by created a few accounts.  They were created
successfully but they had corrupted username so that LOGIN can't find
accounts in ACTDAE.SYS execpt PPN 1,2.

About log files, I added spaces between words on REACT command because
it did not echo SPACE characters back.

Also, I tried 1/2 on Login but it resulted the same...

I am working on it right now...

Barb,

No, I found a bug in my emulator.  That was ADJBP instruction.  It
sometimes produce an incorrect byte pointer.  Yes, it gave -36
instead of 36 in position field.  When I fixed a bug in ADJBP,
All problems disappeared at once!!  Now terminal I/O worked properly with
OPR and REACT.  They no longer complaint about weird something within
command line.  Also they now echo spaces!  When I pressed CR, it
woke up and processed my commands properly.  On REACT, no more
infinite loops when I just executed 'show'.

A few problems are remaining right now.  I tried to enter PPN 1,2
but it did not work properly.  Only usernames worked.

I still am working on it right now...

Whew!

Well, I finally recongized that ACTDAE.SYS was messed up because a bug
in EXTEND instructions put some accounts in wrong ordering.  I tested
some different PPNs like 100,102, 200,200, 103011,4207, 100,500, etc...
I found out that some PPNs worked fine.  Yes, I was able logged into
system by using 'login 100,500'.  I was unable to log into system like
'login 100,100' or 'login 1,2'.  I will restore ACTDAE.SYS from a tape
soon to resolve login problems.  Yes, a bug in EXTEND instructions
already was fixed before to produce wrong SKIP return that I assume.

I will make more tests after ACTDAE.SYS restored from a tape...

Keep you informed later.

Barb:

Yes, I already restored entire disk image from one of my backup files.
When I finished my installation, I saved it for backup archives...

Good news!  I finally resolved all problems with my emulator by using
TOPS-10 7.03 operating system.  I tried every command and did not
encounter any problems.  That was a nasty ADJBP bug cause that
terminal I/O messed up while using OPR and REACT, login did not work
with using PPNs, etc....  I can't believe that buggy ADJBP passed a test
on DSKAM!  The case had been closed...

About TOPS-10 7.04 operating system, I resolved all problems execpt
one thing.  I was unable use OPR and REACT programs because they
stalled forever when they attempted to communicate with GALAXY
daemons.  I looked into SYSTAT and they looks like fine.

About TOPS-20 4.1 operating system, I was able to get the @ prompt on
my emulator.  When I pressed '?', I got a listing of commands.
That's why I need a copy of installation guide to complete TOPS-20
installation.  Only a problem is stalling terminal I/O routines.
Now I have TOPS-20 sources, I looked into APRSRV.MAC and finally
understand it.  I quoted a partial PIAPR procedure from APRSRV.MAC:

Now I found out that this instruction stalled my CTY routines in my
emulator because my CTY routine instantly cleared CTYOWD and sent an
interrupt back to KS10 Processor but later instruction destroy that
requested interrupt before dismiss that instruction! ! I have press
any key to release stalled process to continue.  I will fix that soon.

However, I still am not finishing my TS-10 emulator project because
LP20, DZ11, and other few devices had not implemented yet.  A few
instructions are not implemented yet.  I implemented CMPS, MOVS,
and CVTDB/CVTBD instructions.  EDIT instruction had not
implemented yet.  FP, CVTxx, and other few instructions did not
pass required tests with using KLAD package.  When
all instructions passed tests, the emulator will be released to public.

Tim, are you just trying to get LPT output routed to a printer, or are you 
committed to emulating devices as originally configured by DEC? I'm asking, 
because it seems to me emulating an LP11 would be easier than an LP20. While 
DEC never released a KS-10 with an LP11, while I was with ADP all of our LPT 
support was via LP11s. The LP11 device service routine, while not on any DEC 
release tapes, may still be available from sources I am still in touch with.

BTW, even while I was porting TOPS-10 to the KS, using an LP20 never made any 
sense to me. Because of the "NUXI problem" one had to manipulate the output 
stream a byte at a time to get it into an order that made sense to the UBA for 
a DMA transfer to the LP20. I seemed to me that if you had to handle the data 
a byte at a time anyway it was just as efficient (more efficient?) to simply 
ship it to a "byte at a time" device like the LP11. Besides, the LP11 was a 
lot cheaper than an LP20.

For this reason, the LP20 service routine was one of the few pieces of the 
KS-10 implentation I wasn't responsible for. Doug Detroy implemented that 
module.

Tim,

I don't have a 4.1 installation for Tops-20, but the contents did not change
much if at all between 4.1 and 7.0 on the KL-10; I imagine that they were the
same or similar on the KS-10.

The Installation Tape contains 6 files:

	MONITR.EXE
	EXEC.EXE
	DLUSER.EXE
	DLUSER save set
	DUMPER.EXE
	DUMPER save sets (one long file, multiple sets internally)

There was a bug in DLUSER that actually made the installation manual wrong at
one point, so here's how to install a Tops-20 system once you are at the EXEC
prompt ("@").  The indented comments are for your information; obviously, you
should not type them.

@enable
	turns on OPERATOR privileges--you are logged in as OPERATOR at this
	point--and changes prompt to "$"

$rewind mta0:
	to make your life easier should you need to re-boot

$copy mta0: <system>monitr.exe
$copy mta0: <system>exec.exe
	now you can re-boot from disk and get an EXEC started

$copy mta0: <SUBSYS>dluser.exe
	NOTE THE DIRECTORY!

$copy mta0: USERS.TXT
	this is the DLUSER data file's default name, which makes life easier

$copy mta0: <SUBSYS>dumper.exe
	let's get all the copying out of the way now, and start the installa-
	tion process

$dluser
DLUSER> structure ps:
	default, but let's do everything by the book, as it were

DLUSER> load users.txt
	defines the directory layout of the public structure

DLUSER> exit

	The Installation Tape contains <SYSTEM>, <SUBSYS>, and <UETP.LIB> in
	DUMPER save sets.  Repeat the RESTORE command below to load all sets.

$dumper
[Using MTA-DUMPER:]
DUMPER> tape mta0:
	must specify a tape, and MTA-DUMPER: is not (yet) defined

DUMPER> restore ps:<*>*.*.*
	This will get the <SYSTEM> files

	I'm assuming that you have named the public structure "PS:", but if you
	called it something else (e.g., "FOO:") the command should read
		restore ps:<*>*.*.* foo:<*>*.*.*

DUMPER> restore ps:<*>*.*.*
	This gets the initial <SUBSYS> files

DUMPER> restore ps:<*>*.*.*
	This gets the GALAXY <SUBSYS> files

DUMPER> restore ps:<*>*.*.*
	This gets the <UETP.LIB> files

DUMPER> exit

$unload mta0:

$information disk-usage ps:<*>
	This will tell you how much disk space is taken up by each directory

	The next step is optional:  If you want to catch the memory image of
	the system in case of monitor crashes, you need to create a repository
	file called <SYSTEM>DUMP.EXE of the memory size on your system.  For
	example, if you have 4MW of memory, specify "4096" below.

$run <subsys>makdmp.exe
MAKDMP> create ps:<system>dump.exe 4096
MAKDMP> exit

Once you've gotten this far, we can explore the next things you need to do to
set up a Tops-20 system.  And maybe in the mean time someone will find a KS-10
Installation Guide.  It won't be me, since I've never worked with the little
guys (except as a tourist at MIT).

The old AUXACC functions are definitely part of what's managed by REACT
talking with ACTDAE.  I forget just where the split wound up with regards to
quotas, although I do remember that we can establish the login structure
quotas in REACT.  The old STRLST functions, though, are now handled by
CATLOG talking with CATDAE.  The "not cataloged" error Tom's getting comes
from REACT's own checks with CATDAE to validate the structures.

Of course, that won't get him a JSL when he logs in.  Tom, you'll have to
look at what it takes to get your disk structure(s) understood through
CATLOG before you can successfully set them up in REACT.  Unfortunately,
CATDAE and that part of REACT were DPM's, not mine, so I can't help much.
I'd be going by CATLOG's on-line help, too.

OK, I misremembered badly.  CATLOG was the daemon, and OPR was the user
interface.  I got confused by how the catalogue tables get stuffed into OPR and
ORION when they're built--it happens by hidden magic inside GALCNF when it writes
out GLXCNF.MAC.  C'est la guerre.

Barb,

Good news! I finally figured them out and successfully added DSKB disk
structure to a list in STRLST.SYS file.  Then I tried that on REACT and
successfully added disk quota to [103011,4207] and was able login into
system as [103011,4207] with correct user directory now.  Also,
I ran QUOLST to check disk quota and it correctly display disk
quota information.  Whew!!

However, I have a problem with "IGNORE" keyword.

Try doing this command to OPR by hand.  I have no idea what 
that IGNORE is for or if it should even be there.  Actually I have
not idea why in the hell we have card punches in the script.

OK, now just as a warning for young and foolish ;-).

TOPS-10 will forcibly enforce that quota.  You will only
be allowed to have 1000 blocks on the disk.  If you try
to log out with more (and there were ways to get over
quota without getting blown up), LOGOUT will cheerfully
delete files until the quota is below 1000.  One of the
things I always did was set my Quota In to be many blocks
less than the Quota Out.  That way my jobs got their
hand slapped before I reached logged out quota but none
of the files ever got deleted.  It was very useful for 
the PPNs I used to run batch jobs when I did the software
builds for packaging the distribution tapes.

And 1000 blocks isn't near enough for doing much development
work :-).  Just don't make the figure larger than the
RP06 can handle.

Kinda like Pavlov's dog. I know DZ11's personally from KS10's. I know
Tim Stark is almost finished with his KS10 emulator - DING!

What was so bad about that poor DZ?

While not having written a driver from scratch, I did dig into the one
in 6.03 for it (or whatever the hell hacked version we had - probably
thanks to ADP).

I got it to do 19200 baud with no problems. While working on a
"network thang", I looked into driving the DZ11 directly to do
serial I/O between all five of our KS10's. I started out OPENing
TTYnnn, which was really a virtual port in the DCA crossed-over
to another port in the other KS10's. I decided to take a look at
driving the existing DZ11's that were not used at all.

Oh well... when the TS-10 is done, I plan on diving into the
DZ11 again to get incoming telnet's to work. Unless Tim in his
typically lightning-speed fashion incorporates it himself :)

Strange salia you have... The DZ is the pits. Fries its neibours,
is a pain to drive, and has its own quircks as well. All the overhead
of a Mux and a single line interface in one. Did save $$ ( vs a DH )
or space ( vs DLs ).

Hello folks:

Good news!  I finally made it by almost finished my KS10 emulator.  Floating
instructions are not finished yet but... TOPS-10 v7.03 operating system
run reliably on my KS10 emulator.  I ran it on my KS10 emulator more than one
hour without any problems.  Whew.

However, I have some problems with TOPS-10 v7.04 and TOPS-20 v4.1
operating systems.

For TOPS-10 v7.03, it worked fine. No problems yet.

For TOPS-10 v7.04, I was unable to communicate with galaxy
daemons through OPR program.  Also LOGIN did not work due the same
problem.  

For TOPS-10 v4.1, I had some problems with interrupt handling.
Some interrupt handling are stalling frequently.  For example, TOPS-20
v4.1 always stopped during printing characters.  They are reproductive
because they always result the same.

I apologized to Megan because I accidently borrowed her code to complete
my emulator last summer.  I completely removed her code from it.  I
rewrote my all instructions to access previous and current AC blocks directly
not through memory routines, etc.

Also I thank to Robert Supnik for providing his KS10 codes to me.  I studied
his KS10 code and corrected my some codes.  My emulator now runs more reliably
than before.

It just happened.  When I followed KS10 microcode source by wrote my ADJBP
instruction.  When I looked his KS10 code, I was shocked to notice that my
code is very similar to his!  Well, I assume that he did followed same KS10
microcode by writing his. :-)

Now I ran KLAD tests and fixed many bugs in my some instructions.  I was
forced to fix some instructions that ended up more similar like his code..
That made KLAD tests happy.  Yes, their tests are so tough because I had
to follow KS10 microcode documentation, his KS10 code, etc.  That's why
they require to follow alogrithms on KS10 microcode and his KS10 code in
order to work properly.  I am trying work on them looks different from
other codes.  I apologizes for that.

Well, I now decide to release my code to public and let developers to fix
some instructions, etc. to resolve problems with TOPS-10 v7.04 and TOPS-20
v4.1 operating systems.

I read my book about CVS.  Its title is "Open Source Developement with CVS".
I learned that I can use 'cvs import' to upload them into SourceForge.  I
will release my code to public night tomorrow.

Any segguestions?

Thank you!

Tim, I do hope you release emulator source and now is as good a time
as any.  But I want to add that I think you've done an amazing job of
developing it to this point.  The only other people who have gotten as
far were very experienced PDP-10 hackers like KLH, and corporate
funded multi-person projects consisting of same (i.e. XKL).  My hat is
off to you.

Don't use cvs import.  I emailed you detailed instructions on what to do.
In case you didn't get my email, here's a copy:

From: Eric Smith <eric@brouhaha.com>
To: Timothy Stark <sword7@grace.speakeasy.org>
Subject: CVS repository creation

Timothy,

Here's some step-by-step instructions to help you with CVS.  It is
easiest if you put your source directory into a nested directory (which
need not contain anything else).  I'm assuming you'll have it in the
directory ~/work/ts10 but you can easily substitute anywhere else.  I
also assume that you are using the bash shell; if you use tcsh you'll
have to use setenv instead of export.  I've shown the shell prompt as '% '.

1.  Set the CVSROOT environment variable to point to where you want
    the repository to live:

	% export CVSROOT=~/ts10-cvs

    For tcsh, the equivalent would be:

	% setenv CVSROOT ~/ts10-cvs

    (Note the space instead of the equals sign.) 

2.  Create the repository directory:

	% mkdir $CVSROOT

3.  Tell CVS to initialize the repository:

	% cvs init

4.  Create the subdirectory in the repository for your source files:

	% mkdir $CVSROOT/ts10
	% ls $CVSROOT
	CVSROOT  ts10
	% 

    If your working source tree has subdirectories, create a similar
    subdirectory structure here.  For instance, if you have
    ts10/foo, ts10/bar, and ts10/bar/baz:

	% mkdir $CVSROOT/ts10/foo $CVSROOT/ts10/bar $CVSROOT/ts10/bar/baz

5.  cd to the parent of the source directory:

	% cd ~/work

    (Note that your ts10 source code is in the ts10 directory *below* this
    one.  If you do an "ls" at this point, it should just show the ts10
    subdirectory.)

6.  Do a cvs checkout.  This sets up the CVS subdirectories in
    the source tree:

	% cvs checkout ts10

    This will produce output with one line for each file in ts10, with a
    question mark at the left.  This indicates that cvs has found those
    files but they are not yet part of the repository.

7.  cd into the source directory:

	% cd ts10

8.  do a cvs add of all files you want to go into the repository, this
    tells CVS that you are going to check them in:

	% cvs add README Makefile *.c *.h

    (Include any other files you want in source control.  If you want
    to leave some source or header files out that aren't actually
    part of your release, you can list the source files explicitly
    rather than using a wildcard.)

9.  If you have subdirectories, cd into them and do a cvs add on them
    as well.  cd back to the top (ts10) directory when you're done.

10.  commit the files, this actually puts them into the repository:

	% cvs commit -m "initial version"

     The -m and string give the initial log message, use anything you
     feel appopriate.  cvs commit works recursively, and will commit
     all the files you've added, even in subdirectories.

     If you ever need to commit files individually, you can give the
     files on the command line.  For instance, if you wanted foo.c and
     bar.c to have a different initial log message than the rest, then
     before doing a commit of everything (as above), you can do this:

	% cvs commit -m "a different log message" foo.c bar.c

11.  verify that everything looks good:

	% cvs status | more

     This will give details about every file in the repository.  Each file
     should have a working revision and a repository revision of 1.1,
     and Status of Up-to-date.  Sometimes I like a more concise summary
     with just the Status field:

	% cvs status | grep Status

     (note the upper case S on the Status in the grep)


For extra verification, check out a copy into a new directory and do
a build.  This will make sure you haven't accidentally omitted any
files:

1.  Make sure CVSROOT is set as in step 1 of the setup above:

	% export CVSROOT=~/ts10-cvs

2.  Make a new directory to check out into:

	% mkdir ~/work2

3.  cd into that directory

	% cd ~/work2

4.  check out the code:

	% cvs checkout ts10

5.  cd into ts10:

	% cd ts10

6.  build the code as usual:

	% make

Once you've done that, you can blow away work2 if you like:

        % cd ~
	% rm -rf ~/work2

Package up the repository:

1.  cd into the repository top-level directory:

	% cd $CVSROOT

2.  tar it up:

	% tar -cvzf ~/ts10-cvs.tar.gz ./ts10

3.  cd out:

	% cd ~

4.  If you like, email me the repository and I'll test it on my system to
    make sure there are no problems.  However, if you've followed the
    steps above, I think it should be fine.

5.  scp the file to SourceForge:
	scp ts10-cvs.tar.gz sword7@ts10.sourceforge.net:/

6.  Submit a request to the Sourceforge CVS people to import the
    repository - for directions see
	http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=768&group_id=1

Let me know if you run into any trouble.

Best regards,
Eric

Timothy is the project admin and developer.  I have admin privs only
because I registered the SourceForge project.  I'm willing to help with
admin tasks, but Timothy can drop my admin privs if he wants.

Developer access is only for those who are approved to directly commit
changes to the source code in CVS.  Timothy can decide who he wants
to approve for this.  Usually it's only a few people at most.  Often
this is determined by who in the community becomes most active in
improving the software.

Other people can certainly be developers, just as thousands of people
are developers of the Linux kernel, but only a few are "official"
developers.  That's not intended to denigrate anyone else's work; it's
just to keep some centralized control over things to avoid complete
chaos.

The project home page will probably eventually be:
	http://www.ts10.org/
It doesn't work yet, don't bother trying.

The SourceForge project summary page will be:
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/ts10/

The CVS repository on SourceForge will only be writable by the
developers that Timothy designates.

Anyone will be able to submit bug reports and patches via SourceForge.
It is up to the officially designated developers to determine what
to do about them.

It is my intention to try to help Timothy with the routine admin tasks
so he doesn't have to waste time on them.  This is why I registed the
SourceForge project and the domain name for him.

I'll probably also build RPM packages for those who want easy imstallation
on Red Hat Linux.  If Timothy wants me to, I'm willing to handle the
general release process.

Best regards,
Eric

In anticipation of release of Timothy Stark's PDP-10 emulator,
I've made gzipped ".tap" style tape archive images available through the
archive site at

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

or, if you prefer direct ftp access, at

  ftp://ftp.trailing-edge.com/pub/pdp10/

I will still keep the ".tpc" style tape archive images around, as
all my tape image tools work from them, and of course anyone can
convert a ".tpc" image to a ".tap" image by simply running the
mtcvtv23 program that comes with Bob Supnik's simulator package.

But I do realize the very real advantages of directly distributing
John Wilson's ".tap" format image for emulator users, and will continue
to do what I can to make life easy for those users, including the
possibility of distributing disk images containing already-
installed TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 systems when such images become
available.

Tim.

Neat. Usually they only were on KL-10s. I like DECTAPEs since I first
saw this elegantly simple device running on an PDP-8/A.

From the "Small Computer Handbook" 1973:

-------------
TD8-E DECTAPE CONTROL

The TD8-E is contained on a single quad Flip-Chip module which plugs
directly into the OMNIBUS of the PDP-8/E.
-------------

That looks like a simple circuit. Direct in FPGA stuff. No
microprocessor, not even trap&emulate.

An real old device connected. Actually given the size, the KI-10 will
just about fit inside the TU-56 drive.


> KA/KI ten on a FPGA chip will hit the scene soon

I expect 1-2 years, depending on how much you want to wait for, before
starting DECTAPEing.

It will be available. Actually what already exists [1] of it is
already available [2].

[1] 32 words of memory, instruction pointer and incrementer, an data
bus multiplexer, 4xx binary logic instruction unit. No interconnects
yet (I was going to try them today [3]), no instruction decoder or
timing control yet.

[2] As usual on the project web site:
http://neil.franklin.ch/Projects/PDP-10/

[3] Sister just phoned and invited me for evening meal, housewarming
her new flat.

When I first read Eric (without Kelly) I first interpreted it as Eric

I take it that you have lost interest in this now Daniel?

I did take Daniels code, restructured it a bit and am slowly working my
way through fixing problems thrown up by the KLAD tests.

Its on the web at <ftp://aconit.org/pdp-10/>, I'll put up my latest
version later on today. It compiles and runs on Linux and Windoze 2000
(and presumably Win98). See readme etc. I thnk it uses only standard C
except in a handlng console input which is factored out as a separate
file., so hopefully it should port easily.

I'll be travelling for the rest of this week, so I'm posting the
latest updates now.

http://www.tiac.net/users/mps/retro/sources/simh26beta7.zip

Check the 0README, there have been some changes in the UI.

For the -10, this version will completely build 7.03.  My first try at
7.04 is a complete washout: whenever I try to start the boostrap
monitor, after DESTROYing, DEFINEing, and REFRESHing DSKB, I get the
following dialog:

Startup option: noinitia
[Rebuilding the system search list from the HOM blocks]

% No structures in system search list
[Rebuilding the active swapping list from the HOM blocks]

% No units in active swapping list
[Rebuilding the system dump list from the HOM blocks]

Startup option:

Tim Stark's sources describe a 'bug' in 7.04 AUTCON; is this the
symptom that is seen?  Since the memory layout between TS10 and ismh
is different (256KW vs 1024KW), I am not sure whether the AUTCON code
would be at the place in memory.  Any other pointers?

Simh V2.6 has been released.  Sources can be downloaded from the simh
web site at:

http://www.tiac.net/users/mps/retro/index.html

New features in simh V2.6:

- PDP-10 simulator
- PDP-11 TS11/TSV05, TC11
- PDP-8 DF32, TC08
- PDP-9/15 DECtape
- New SCP commands: enable/disable device; show devices
- Real time clock autocalibration
- Bug fixes and tweaks

The PDP-10 simulator successfully runs TOPS-10 7.03 and has the same
issues as TS10 with TOPS-10 7.04.  It has not been tested with
TOPS-20.

The TS11/TSV05 is a 22-bit addressing magtape device for Ultrix-11.
It has been tested under RT-11.

The PDP-8 devices have been tested under OS/8.

The 18b DECtapes have been tested with diagnostics.

The tarball has been updated, and I've added a file in /pub called
MD5SUMS containing checksums in case there is any doubt about your

ts10.tar.gz is now a soft link pointing to the most recent tarball.

ftp to sakura.lunar-tokyo.net, pub/ts10-dz11.04182001.tgz is the new code.
This one is a stand-alone tarball - It's the current version of ts10, in
it's entirety, with the DZ11 stuff installed.  Said code is running on
Asuka.umtec.com as well.

And on that note, I'm going to leave off playing with TOPS10 for awhile,
to focus on getting ITS up and running under ts10.  I'm working at
building a monitor on Toad, with moderate success.

From memory, KA "average" instruction time was 2.9 microseconds (varying
from about 2 for simple instructions like JFCL to about 18 for a
floating divide) and the KL did between about 400-500 nanoseconds.

The fastest I ever saw a KA10 run was 1 MHz.  That
was the null job: AOJA 0,1 in register 1.  By not
having to go to the memory bus it was able to count
register 0 about 1 million times per second.

simh has most of the hooks for running ITS, including the unique I/O
instructions and paging.  I still have to finish the 1PROC flag (a
single stepping flag) and also the PC sampling feature.  All the
changes are documented in the KS10 microcode for ITS (KSHACK).

The key problem, as Tim noted, is a bootable disk image.

If you mean the MIGs for TOPS10 7.03 and 7.04 they are at
<ftp://aconit.org/pub/dec-10>
The 7.03 version is pure ascii text, the 7.04 is a zip of the individual
TIFF page scans. There is also a PDF version of the 7.04 scans.

I wouldn't say that it was "hidden".  It may very well have
been put into the code to solve a race condition on the real
hardware.  This has been one of my concerns with the emulation.
An emulation is not a simulation.

Right.  That's because the design had to "wait" for the hardware
to catch up or complete or dismiss or whatever.  Part of an
OS efficiency is to do other stuff waiting for "slower" hardware.
Everytime a "faster" piece of gear was put on the system, JMF
and TW had a lot of little tweaks that they had to do just
to keep the operating system efficient.  For instance, putting
KA peripherals on a KI, made jobs I/O bound.  When those 
peripherals were replaced with faster gear to solve the I/O bound
problems, a system would become CPU bound.  It was a never-ending
circular tweaking effort.  

In the case of these emulators, both CPU and I/O speeds have
increased.  I had no idea what kinds of problems would show up,
but I certainly expected them :-).  What I can't explain is
the 7.03 vs. 7.04 differences.  I really didn't think that
disk I/O had been tweaked since TW was long gone.  But then
there were all youngsters in the group who hadn't learned about
not touching things that work.

IF, and notice the big IF, I had the energy to expend, I'd
probably try to approach the problem by running the 7.04 
monitor with 7.03 CUSPs.  If the disk geometry remains in
tact, we can then assume that the problems are in how somebody
does I/O in the 7.04 CUSP ship.

Then I would try to run the 7.04 CUSPs under 7.03 to see if
something stupid happens.  But this may be fraught with
problems if the CUSPs use some new feature of 7.04.  I just
don't remember the details to say if such restrictions exist.

Hello folks:

Today latest updates had been uploaded to SourceForge.  You may go
ahead to get them.

KLINIK port (2nd console device) had been added.  Due to security reason,
password is required to enter KLINIK device.  Look into 'fe.c' for
defines.  You can change your KLINIK password, port, etc for your own.

Its default port for CTY and KLINIK are 5000 and 5001.

On TOPS-20 v4.1, I attempted to log into as KLINIK but quickly was told
that all remote logins not allowed.  New call/carrier loss detection worked
fine with TOPS-20 v4.1 but.. TOPS-10 series normally does not detect them.

Also, bugs in IMUL and floating instructions had been fixed for better
accuracy, etc.  They now passed all DSKDA tests with random values.
In floating routines, all 32-bit fractions had changed to 64-bit
fractions for better accuracy according to DSKDA tests.

A bug in TM02/TM03 routines had been fixed.  Now you can backspace
tape record (space reverse function).

For more information, read ChangeLog in pdp10 directory.

For next updates, I will work on overdue problems in TOPS-20 v4.1 to
resolve.  I debugged TOPS-20 v4.1 by running DUMPER to restore files.
I learned that only happened to tape operations.  Disk operations in
TOPS-20 worked fine.  I was able to copy DLUSER, DUMPER, MONITR, and
EXEC into TOPS-20 system without any problems but. I ended up overdue
problems during DUMPER restores.

Hello folks:

Finally first KL10 execution on my TS10 emulator!...  It emulates KL10-A
processor (extended addressing not implemented yet).

Yes, I was able load and run BOOTM.EXE from Linux filesystem at TS10>
prompt without any problem.  Also, I fixed some bugs in disassembly
routines because they disassembled KS10-only I/O instructions.  After
bugs were fixed, it now disassemble any Kx10 I/O instructions.  I
added some configraton flags, etc to indicate which PDP-10 processor.

According to my debug log file, I noticed that first mysteriously codes
(starting at location 332) were executed that are not found in BOOTM.MAC.
Where did they come from?  It transfers mysterious codes to device code
220 (not implemented yet - acts like null device).  I looked into BOOTM.MAC
and can't find any in it.  However, I found device code 220 -- PDC.  It
looks like PDP-8 interface to me.  Now I remember that that is for DA-10
interface? right?

It finally reached location 1000 (BOOTM entry point).  It correctly
detected a processor as KL10 Processor, etc.. Later, it is trying print
something and waiting forever for done flag.  Good.  I will work on
device DTE interface soon. Also I have to implement APR, PI, and PAG
to complete KL10-A emulation.  Yes, it is KS10-compatible but
entire different I/O interface.

I have a question for you. I never heard of device code 220 (PDC) before.
What is PDC for? How does it work?  Is it a DA-10 (PDP-8 based) interface?

I downloaded today's CVS, and compiled it - I had to make the following
changes:

emu/socket.c - add #include <sys/file.h> to define FASYNC
pdp10/cpu_main.c - I like to use -DIDLE so I had to change the
	WORD36_SXT to a SXT36

Also had to add "-lnsl -lsocket" to final link in main Makefile

Other than that, I had no problems whatsoever, except for an annoying
blocking on the "panel". I can startup with "ts10 -f ./ks10.cfg" and
get the TS10 prompt. From there, typing doesn't do anything, although
if I type "boot rpa0" (no echo), and then telnet into the console
port 5000, it comes up and runs correctly.

I had fixed this in an earlier version, and so far, can't remember
what I did - I'll look into it a little more.

The above was done with Solaris 8 X86 and Gcc-2.8.1. I was able to
boot an existing RP06 with my MONGEN'd monitor.

I also have access to Solaris 2.6 and 7 Sparc, and will try this there
also, later today.

No, he's talking about non-PDP-10, non-DEC gear at this point.  The H316 and
H516 were Honeywell boxes, used among other things as ARPANET IMPs (way in the
way back when...).  Bob's simh is a true wonder, with more personalities than
Sibyl.

NP, Art.  The clock logic compensates for processor speed by checking
the amount of real time elapsed every simulated second, and speeding
up or slowing down the clock as required.

On a different thread, about getting sys000.exe into the 'right
format'.  I hacked up one of the public domain backup programs to do
extraction of binary files as well as ASCII files.  The binary format
is 36b in 64b, assuming that the on tape format was PDP-10 core dump.
I used this successfully to get the diagnostic .EXE's and SAV's off
the KLAD tape.  simh can load a SAV or EXE in this format into memory
via the LOAD command.

The hacked sources were on the dbit ftp site; I will also post them on
the simh site over the weekend.

I've gotten all the way through a TOPS-20 V4.1 installation on simh,
but not without some caveats.

To start with, this log is produced with the next version of the
simulator, which includes logging.  It also includes a shortcut for
dealing with the TOPS-20 V4.1 boot problem:

sim> set cpu tops20v41

catches the bad WRCSTM in the boot process.  To do this by hand,

sim> d break 7
sim> BOOT TU or RP

Breakpoint at PC: 000007
sim> d 40127 770000000000
sim> c

The first part of the installation (up to the reboot) works just as
stated in the manuals.  After the reboot, things aren't so clean:

------

After the reboot, there are a couple of glitches:

1. The 4-1-config.cmd file seems to have an improper command in it, or
I have the wrong format for setting speed.

2. There's a bug check as the system comes up, stating that the
checkpoint area needs to be rebuilt.  Apparently, it does get rebuilt
properly.

3. Most critically, there are errors in UETP.  The Verify program
fails with "improper generations" on the CRAM and BOOT files.  In a
subsequent run, I tried the RANCBL and RANFOR programs.  The RANCBL
runs to completion, but RANFOR gives an error message, but no details,
every time.  I suspect there are still bugs in the floating point
code.  Does anyone know how to debug from UETP programs?

Thanks,

/Bob

Assuming you're running the version from May 5th, the session
in which you start up the emulator no longer becomes the operator's
CTY console. Instead, while you leave the emulator running in the
first session, you need to start another session, this one with
TELNET, and direct it to port 5000. You won't be prompted by the
host OS to log in; instead, you'll get a KS10 Emulator banner.

Press the space bar a couple of times, and you should get the
BOOT> prompt. From there, the posted instructions should work
just fine.

The tape implementation in TS10 is read only.

Try simh if you need to write tapes.

Yeah. That is right.  I thought that it was.  I will fix it soon.  

Also, I found another suspect that cause illegal UUO message when it 
executed RANDOMIZE in BASIC program.  I am looking for a bug to fix in 
progress..

When IMUL was executed, it was trapped due to overflow bit set.  It
was attempted to execute trap instruction.  It feteched 0,,5 and
tried to execute.  It cause UUO trap.  I am looking for a bug that put 
0,,5 in trap address or so..

Hello all,

	I put up simh_2.6-pdp10.tar.gz as
http://pdp10.kilonet.org/files/sim_2.6-pdp10.tar.gz

	This includes the DZ11 code from Thorn Nilson.
Do an "attach dz0 <portno>" where portno is the TCP/IP port.

My config file:

kilowatt% more ks10.cfg
attach rp0 tops10-rpa0.simh.dsk
attach tu0 /home/krewat/ts10/tops10_703_ksbootable_bb-x138b-bb.tap
attach tu1 /home/krewat/tmp/scratch-tape.tap
attach dz0 12000
set tim y2k

Do a "make pdp10" and it should build. Makefile assumes you have gcc,
and depending on your OS, you may have to remove the "-lnsl -lsocket"
from the build line. I did this under Solaris 8 with GCC 2.8.1

Then do a:

pdp10 ks10.cfg

And, if booting from tape, do a "boot tu0" or from disk "boot rp0"

Then, do "telnet localhost 12000" and away we go. I know of no
bugs or problems. The system time is perfect. I have stress
tested it with up to 8 terminals all running twenty SYS commands
and no problems - on a dual Celeron 533.

I will put up bootable disk images of TOPS-10 7.03 for RP06 as time
permits.

The only lingering problem is if you kill the simulator with a
^E and quit, you can't reattach dz0 to port 12000 for a while.
I know what it is, but have yet to really investigate. Good ole
TIME_WAIT.

aak

Tim is right, alas.  All simh disks are stored in natural word length,
in the next larger power-of-2 byte container, in little endian format.
So the PDP-8 stores 12b in 16b, the PDP-11 16b in 16b, the PDP-15 18b
in 32b, the VAX 32b in 32b, and the PDP-10 36b in 64b.

Simh has 'endian independent' binary I/O routines (fxread and fxwrite)
for dealing with endian-ness, but I don't have a big-endian system for
consistent testing.

Dave Conroy found a bug in SIMH's big-endian I/O routines, that cause
them to malfunction on large block transfers.  This impacts,
primarily, the simulation of DECtapes, floppy disks, and fixed head
disks, which buffer their data in memory.  (Impacted simulators:
PDP-8, PDP-11, PDP-9/15, Nova.)

Please get the latest source release from

All who have downloaded the TOPS-10 7.03 disk image:

The system name is set to "LIRICS Timesharing Gold".
If you want to change this, do this:

.COPY SYS:SYSNEW.EXE=SYS:SYSTEM.EXE
.R FILDDT
File: SYS:SYSNEW.EXE/P

$$t   CONFIG/   LIRIC   "/LIRIC/<^J>
CNFTBL+1/   S Tim   	"/S Tim/<^J>
CNFTBL+2/   eshar   	"/eshar/<^J>
CNFTBL+3/   ing G   	"/ing G/<^J>
CNFTBL+4/   old   	"/old/<^J>
<^Z>

EXIT
.

$ is an <ESC> (escape)
$$t forces ASCII printout.
<^J> is a Control-J (line feed)
<^Z> is a Control-Z - EXIT!
You need to type the first "CONFIG/", the rest will
be done automatically with the ^J

Text is entered inside the "/ and the ending /

CONFIG and CNFTBL symbols are identical in 7.03, while
in 6.03, I think it's just CONFIG.

After doing a "boot rp0" and getting the BOOT> prompt,
you can type "SYSNEW" and it will boot the new SYSTEM.EXE
If it works do this:

.REN SYS:SYSOLD.EXE=SYS:SYSTEM.EXE
.REN SYS:SYSTEM.EXE=SYS:SYSNEW.EXE

This will move the altered monitor in place of the original
and save the original as SYSOLD.EXE, which you can always
boot from if you need to.

aak

ps: LIRICS is Long Island Regional Instructional Computer Society
It was originally a PDP-8, then a KA10, then five KS10's, serving
high-schools and guidance departments across Suffolk County.
Gold was one of the last KS10's purchased, and had a Megaword
of memory.

One college (South Hampton) used LIRICS, and possibly some Nassau
schools. Many high-schoolers got their feet wet on mainframes
this way - thank god it was DEC equipment :)

Alan Bawden's FTP directory (ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/people/alan/its/)
contains the source for Teco, and the Teco for Emacs as well as the
ITS source and documentation, some of which makes poignant reading.
Still no sign of either a Midas assembler or Maclisp or Macsyma,
but I'm sure something is out there somewhere.   The Midas assembler
is the most important -- without that, nothing else will work.

I had no direct contact with ITS at the time it was still being
used, but I *have* used Genera, its immediate successor which bears
more than a passing similarity to ITS.

There are four things that can be done at this point: leave ITS in
cryogenics, base an entirely new operating system on it (like Genera),
try to bring it back as a museum curio by getting it to run on a
PDP-10 emulator, or bringing it back as a living operating system
by porting it to C (in which case there's some catching up to do).

I've started to organize the directory structure where RCS stores our
"work in progress" (note that our main web site is at
http://www.osfn.org/rcs/   this other http://starfish.rcsri.org/rcs/
site is only for notes and info relating to our restoration projects,
and these files are mostly lists of modules etc.)

http://starfish.rcsri.org/rcs/DECsystem/ with subdirs for 2020 and 2065

We hold a public Open House on the third Saturday of each month.  Or
drop me a note if you are going to be in the Providence area, and we can
arrange for a visit.  Within the next couple of weeks we will have a
work session to continue the restoration of the pdp-11/40 front-end in
the KL.

Hello folks:

Since I implemented RH20/MBA/RPx routines into my TS10 emulator, I 
sucessfully initialized/formatted the RP06 disk emulation file.  It took
a very few seconds to complete refresh processing.  It is faster than my
RH11 routines under my KS10 emulation!  That's why I implemented transfer 
routines with a array of 18-bit words (block) each write/read access.
Also, I fixed two instructions (CAIx and byte instructions) that were not
compatible with extended addressing that cause EWB stopcodes (a bug in
byte instruction during SAT initialization) and NPJ stopcodes (a bug in 
CAIx instruction).

Now it finally print 'To automatically log-in under [1,2], type LOGIN' 
then EUE stopcode.  Yes, it now is trying to print a dot! :-)  I am
working on it.  EUE stopcode is occuring during CTX routines.
It crashed at 1,,415557.  I am figuring out why...

My screen log is here:

Hello folks:

Well, I found a problem that cause EUE stopcode in my KL10 emulator.  I
traced through my 40 megs debug log file from JSR @ONCE location to
the crash.  It was very long execution.  I learned how well does TOPS-10 
prepare for the timeshare.

1.  Set up EDV entry on location 112.
2.  Move DDB blocks, part of SYSINI routines, etc.
3.  Turn all priority interrupts for devices, etc on.
4.  Start I/O devices for timeshare.
5.  Turn timer on.
6.  Set up the null job preparation.
   :

It reached SETCSH routine in KLSER.MAC.  It attempted to print
"%% Cache is disabled" on my screen but crashed into EUE stopcode
instead of.  I am investiaging on the problem in the progress.
Yes. it is very close to the dot.

Please note it will take you into the game, but you can control c or
quit to get out of it.  That will take you to the command line. I
haven't set up a search list (don't know how).

Anyone up to a game of decwar?  How bout 7:00 pm CST tonite?

Asuka is back up again, and I made new ts10/dz11 tarballs.

ftp://sakura.lunar-tokyo.net/pub/ts10.tgz is ts10 from CVS as of this
morning.  Get that first.  Don't compile.

ftp://sakura.lunar-tokyo.net/pub/ts10-dz11-070901.tgz is the dz11 code.
Unpack in the same directory as the above.  Then compile.

The only known bug present is that Linux clobbers XON/XOFF for some
reason.  I haven't had time to fix this yet.

I tried to compile TS10 with the new version of dz11. The files /dev/dzclient.c and 
/dev/dzclear.c both use the include <stropts.h>. <stropts.h> is not in the NetBSD includes and 
is not part of your package. These programs compile fine without this include.

/pdp11/cpu_main.c has an external reference to dz_main() in p10_Go. The linker can't resolve 
this reference.

I've been running TOPS-10 on simh (on genuine DEC hardware) for a month or
two now.  While I've still got plenty of space on the RP06 I've got mounted,
I'm wondering about adding a second RP06 (what can I say DSKB looks lonely).

Anyway, can simh handle multiple RP06's (it appears to be able to), and how
do I set the disk up under TOPS-10 (I know how to create it under simh).

There is a serious bug in the PDP-10/PDP-11 RP for BIG ENDIAN systems
only.  There is a direct call to fread instead of fxread (the
endian-switching I/O routine).  As a result, operation of the RP
drives on big endian systems was either inconsistent or impossible.

If you have been trying to get SIMH for the PDP-10 running on a big
endian machine, please get the latest version of the simulator from

http://www.tiac.net/users/mps/retro/simh26b.zip

This bug was found by Peter Schorn; thank you, Peter.

Never noticed it up to now. Good you today just picked a day when I
have a bit of time free.


> who knows will listen: *Is* there a MIME type for 36-bit binaries?

No there is not. I just went and looked at the official standards
document (thats what the time got used for), RFC2045, at
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2045.html

This sniplet says it all:

-------------
6.  Content-Transfer-Encoding Header Field

   Many media types which could be usefully transported via email are
   represented, in their "natural" format, as 8bit character or binary
   data.

..

   It is necessary, therefore, to define a standard mechanism for
   encoding such data into a 7bit short line format.

..

   mechanism := "7bit" / "8bit" / "binary" /
                "quoted-printable" / "base64" /
                ietf-token / x-token
-------------

So MIME seems to have been invented as an n*8bit world only.


But we do have an possibility, as they left the back door open:

-------------
6.3.  New Content-Transfer-Encodings
   Implementors may, if necessary, define private Content-Transfer-
   Encoding values, but must use an x-token, which is a name prefixed by
   "X-", to indicate its non-standard status, e.g., "Content-Transfer-
   Encoding: x-my-new-encoding".
-------------

So what about making such an extension, like when formats for storing
tape images in 8bit files got defined? Multiple possible implementations
come to mind:


1) send 36bit on 8bit channels as 2*36bit in 9*8bit. If there is a
single 36bit left over pad it with 4 or 36 zero bits. This seems to
be what FTP does in Image mode, if I get RFC354 right. Call this
version x-36bit (or x-6bit analog to 8bit for n*8bit data).

For mails this poses a problem because it will need to be additionally
base64-ed, making it one encoding in an other.


2) send 12/18/24/36bit data as n times 6bits each packed in one ASCII
char. Call this version x-6base64. This is more universal and already
mail compatible. But it is inefficient for HTTP/Web.

As coding for the latter one could use that used in base64, which
first does 3*8->4*6bit and then stuffs each 6bit into one ASCII.
The table for this from RFC2045:

-------------
     Table 1: The Base64 Alphabet

     Value Encoding  Value Encoding  Value Encoding  Value Encoding
         0 A            17 R            34 i            51 z

   The encoded output stream must be represented in lines of no more
   than 76 characters each.
-------------


4) define both 1) and 2) for HTTP/Web and Mail respectively, just like
there exist 8bit and base64 for n*8bit machines in these 2 circumstances.


3) no new encoding at all. Simply make an standard 36bit in 8bit
file format, like with (derived from?) the 36bit in 8bit tape
container formats and then use an normal 8bit web server.

This method would just use the file ending and resulting MIME
Content-Type: for controlling the whole process.



Note that in addition to an Content-Transfer-Encoding: we will any way
need additional Content-Type: entries for the typical files. Looking
at RFC2046 we will have to use application/* types. I suggest:

application/x-sixbit            for SIXBIT text
  text/* is not allowed for this, as that hast to be ASCII derived
application/x-sextet-stream     for non-specified n*6bit binaries
  analog to the official octet-stream for n*8bit
application/x-tops10-exe        for TOPS-10 .EXE, TOPS-20 analog
  same also for all other file types, object files, ...
  this analog to some of the x- types on the SGI machine I looked at


There is also an RFC2048 which describes the procedure for having
types added as official extensions to MIME. So if we design a standard
we could even have it officially blessed.

I mean the console of simh, maybe you can redirect stderr/stdout to a file?

I don't know, Bob can tell you. I put it into 2.6a, as on pdp10.kilonet.org
I have 2.6b, and wanted to hack it into place, but have yet to do so.

I will make a .TAP image tomorrow for you ... MONGEN'ing is no problem, if
you follow the MIG, but it may take more than an hour to read it and actually
do the build.

Of course, you will get the Y2K'd version :)

hello folks,
I have been busy with life but I have had a chance to get linux 
installed on one of my alphas.  I have compiled ts10, and run it today.
Under NetBSD, I got a peak of 270Kops reported in the log.  With 
linux on the same beast, same compiler (GCC) I am getting about the
same (have not hit the same peak but the numbers are just about the
same).

I have snagged the DEC, err Q, alpha C compiler (and C++) and am 
installing thoes - usual deal, I am using a linux distro that does
not support the compiler directly but I am close.

Ok, so why this drivel?  I am curious as to whether or not any one
else has compiled and run TS10 on a similar system (meaning alpha,
with Linux) and what kind of perf have you gotten?

My intent is to compile the simh and ts10 stuff under linux, and 
see if I can get the binaries to run on NetBSD on the alphas.

I just want these alphas to get numbers higher than the Intel PCs...
thanks
bob

Zane,
I do have it running on NetBSD - but the gcc for alpha does not take 
advantage of alpha the way the Q compilers do - at least that is what
I am tring to prove.  On NetBSD, I get between 210Kops/s and 270Kops/s
(according to the debug log), and my numbers so far, on the same
machine with Linux, are 210 to 220.  I guess this is a test of the
compiler efficiency.
Thanks!!
bob

        May or may not be relevant, but Kernel Korner in the current
(August) issue of Linux Journal has an article on adjusting assembly
language routines in the kernel to give higher performance from Alpha
processors. The article talks of 40% gains, *but* that is in terms of system
overhead (kernel time) for some workloads. Unfortunately, this article is
not available on line - have to go to a magazine store.

I finally got tired of trying to keep track of which tapes are which and
what is needed for an install, and just used the 703.BWR and 704.BWR files
and poking around on http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/ to figure out which 
tapes go in which set, here is what I found, hopefully someone besides just
me will find it useful :^)

Thank you, it is interesting to see what is supposed to be there and
what actually is available!

John Wilson has three RSX20F V16.00 floppies available from

  ftp://ftp.dbit.com/pub/pdp10/kl10/rsx20f/

(Tim Stark just alerted me to these last week, though they've been there
for a couple of months now.)

I'm not sure what the revision history of RSX20F is, or whether RSX20F V16.00
will work with 7.03 or 7.04.  Clearly this is all important to folks with
KL10's!

Tim.

Excerpted from 703.mco:

5.3.1  Dropping Back To 7.02 - The   major   operational    difference
between  7.02  and  7.03  on  a  KL10  processor is the fact that 7.03
requires a new microcode and bootstrap (BOOT).   7.02  will  run  with
7.03  KL  microcode,  bootstrap, and V15-50 RSX-20F provided Autopatch
tape #9 has been applied to 7.02.

Which leads me to believe that 7.03 needs at least V15-50 of RSX-20F? I would
imagine that V16 supports TOPS-20, and maybe that even V16 would work
with TOPS-10???

OK, I just dug out the following information on 7.04:
http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/pdp-10/CUSPBINSRC_1OF2_BB-X128C-SB/FELOAD.P11

;3      Extend table of .STDTB values to include the one for version
;       16-00 of RSX-20F.
;       10-Feb-88 /JJF

This would seem to indicate to me that V16, which can be found on John
Wilson's site, is the one that is needed for 7.04.  Hmm, looking a little
more in the file finds the following:

;*** NOTE THAT NEWER VERSIONS OF 20F WILL NEED TO HAVE ENTRIES IN THE DTBX
MACRO
;*** SIMPLY LOOK AT THE NEW RSX20F MAP FOR THE VALUE OF .STDTB.
        .MACRO  DTBX    ;;LIST OF .STDTB VALUES
XP      1506,6350       ;VERSION 1506
XP      1550,6372       ;VERSION 1550
XP      1600,6372       ;VERSION 1600


Based on this I'd guess that 7.04 will will work with V15-06, V15-50, and
V16-00.

Here is an even stronger indicator that V16-00 is the correct one for 7.04:
http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/pdp-10/CUSPBINSRC_1OF2_BB-X128C-SB/CUSP.BWR


"7.0  RSX20F

The CUSP tape contains the TOPS-10 Version 7.04 release of the  RSX20F
front-end  software  for  both  1090  (DECtape) and 1091/1095 (Floppy)
based systems.  This software, comprising Version VA16-00 (for 1090's)
and  VE16-00  (for  1091/1095's)  includes  the  following  fixes  and
enhancements:

     1.  All known PCOs to RSX20F on TOPS-20  have  been  applied  and
         tested on TOPS-10.

     2.  A problem with reading and processing the last card in a deck
         with CD20 card readers has been fixed.

     3.  A problem where in some  cases  the  name  of  the  microcode
         recorded  in  KLI's  configuration  file became corrupted has
         been fixed.

     4.  The serial numbers of all disk drives visible  to  the  front
         end's  RH11  disk controller are now passed to the Monitor at
         system startup.


In addition, this version of RSX20F comes with a new, simplified,  and
automated  installation procedure.  This new procedure, called RSXINS,
allows you to install RSX20F on your system in five minutes  or  less.
To support RSXINS, two tools are included:  F11 and FELOAD."



Unfortunatly I can't find any info for 7.03, and the MIG is highly against
providing any RSX20F version info.  My guess is that it would want either
15-06 or 15-50, but not the 16-00 (which unfortunatly looks to be all that
is available).

That's because -20F was treated as a different product.

One of the tasks that I never completed (but somebody told me he
did do it) was to ship -20F on the magtapes; this would have
been done with 7.04.

NOpe.  If there had been, it would have been called KS10.BWR.
All of the commentary in the 703.BWR file would have applied
to the full 7.03 ship.  We tried to keep things down to a 
minimum of BWR files based on the package that shipped.  For 
instance, if CPNSER (SMP) had had a separate submission to SDC,
there would have been a CPNSER.BWR on the SMP tape.  When the
SMP tape was submitted as a part of a full monitor ship, the
bewaring would have been included in the 7nn.BWR file on the
monitor tape.

This was the case with -20F for 7.04 submission.

Good.  Then read the BWR file for that tape, and you should have

Hello folks:

I ported my TS10 emulator to Cygwin/Win32.  They were compiled 
successfully (No errors!).  No, I did not modify any coding in TS10 
emulator before attempting to compile it on Cygwin/Win32.  I was able to
run ts10 but it was not responsed to my keyboard!  I believe that SIGIO 
might does not work with Cygwin/Win32.  Its version is v1.1.8.  I am 
upgrading to Cygwin v1.3.3 today and will find out...

Someday, I have plans to port my TS10 emulator to C++ language so that
Visual C++ will be able compiling my TS10 emulator with Winsock2 API, etc.

Arthur:

Yeah. I debugged it and found a problem.  Cygwin does not like F_SETOWN
argument at fcntl statement in socket.c file.  It resulted "Invalid 
Argument".  That's why it did not work with my keyboard.  Ok, I will post
a problem in solaris newsgroup, etc.  I was looking for cygwin newsgroups 
but can't found them.  I checked help (man) facility on Linux and learned 
that F_SETOWN and F_GETOWN are not supported in SVR4 system because they
are BSDism.  That's why my TS10 emulator only works on two UNIX major 
platforms - Linux and BSD systems.  When I resolved problems with
F_SETOWN/F_GETOWN arguments, TS10 emulator should be work on all UNIX and 
Cygwins (under all Win32 systems)  systems.

That's why I am porting my TS10 emulator (stable and developement) to
Solaris/Cygwin systems.

Thank you!

Yeah! I got it.  I looked into Tim's archive and found my older copies of 
TS10.  I downloaded all and put them into my ftp site (/pub/ts10/attic)
directory.  Also I saved them as historical archives....

In verson 3/17/2001, I found out that I_SETSIG should be work on Cygwin 
and Solaris.  I will try that tomorrow.  If it works, I will update 
develop and stable version and let you know that.   I know that I_SETSIG
does not work on Linux platforms.  For Linux and BSD, I have to use 
F_SETOWN.  For Solaris, Cygwin, etc, I have to use I_SETSIG on ioctl
function.  Also, I plan to add Winsock2 API to my TS10 emulator for
Visual C++ compilers for async sockets.  My TS10 emulator is 
interrupt-driven emulation system.

Someday, I would get Intel C/C++ compilers to boost its performance...

For the past couple of nights, I haven't been able to get the
web pages.  www.tiac.net responds to pings, but not to http
requests (at least not before I run out of patience).  Is the
server that busy, or does the problem lie elsewhere?  Anyone
else having problems getting a repsonse?

No, that's fine :)  Nothing will appear until you enable the OS to
talk to your virtual DZ11 ttys.

I had the same problem, I puzzled over it for quite some time until
finally finding an answer buried on the web or Usenet somewhere.

Assuming that you're running TOPS-10 7.03, you'll need to edit
SYS:TTY.INI and add the line:

   TTY0-31:        NAME NOTICE TEXT SPEED:9600 TYPE:VT100

This enables TTY0 through TTY31 to listen at 9600 baud with a VT100
terminal type.

Good luck!

There is a utility called "backwr" that writes .TAP images containing
the files you supply. Do this:

backwr -f a.tap file1 file2 file3

I put up backwr.tar.gz on my web site pdp10.kilonet.org at:

http://pdp10.kilonet.org/files/backwr.tar.gz

Backwr writes BACKUP savesets.

You can then attach this .tap image in SIMH or TS10 and run BACKUP.

have fun!

backwr should write 36 bits to each pdp10 word, from five bytes of input
file, taking the low order seven bits of each, packing them left-to-right.
The MSB of the fifth byte is then stuffed into the last bit.  If your
binary files are in some other format (some other 36 <==> 8 conversion)
it might not work...

I have a version of backwr somewhere, that can expand newlines to CRLFs,
will put that up on the net soon.

If there is a standard way (different from above) of how to store 36-
bit binary files as a stream of bytes, tell me how and I will try to
teach backwr how to handle them.

Use C-Kermit as your Unix Telnet client:

Tell it to "set flow none" (actually you shouldn't have to tell it that;
it's the default).  Then it will treat ^S and ^Q as data characters and

First, there is a new version of backwr.  This new version supports input
files in ANSI-ASCII, with or without newline -> CRLF conversion, and also
files in CORE-DUMP format.  This last format may solve the problem people
have had with transferring binary files.

See ftp://ftp.stacken.kth.se/pub/pdp10/backwr/

I have also made a slight modification to simh:

This implements, for the PDP10, a DEUNA (ethernet) card on the unibus.
The mod consists of the following files:

pdp10_deuna.c   - interface to the pdp10 emulator.
dec_deuna.c     - the actual card emulating code.
eth_dummy.c     - ethernet backend, as in /dev/null.
eth_bpf.c       - ethernet backend that talks bpf.

See ftp://ftp.stacken.kth.se/pub/pdp10/simh-deuna/

I would right now label this code as early beta, but is has transferred
packets with some success, as in "the pdp10 has answerd arp queries".

There are many things still missing from the deuna code.

It should be an easy task to write pdp11_deuna.c, anyone interested?

The IP stack for Tops-10 is not yet in such a shape that I would label
it fit for human consumption.

I used, I think, Beta4 on my Sparc 20/712 with Solaris 8 to setup ITS, it
didn't like using an RP06 and I had to go with a RM03.

Latest version of 2.7 works fine on Solaris 8/Intel, with a four-disk
RP06 structure under TOPS-10 7.03.

Also, compiled it under Solaris 8/Sparc (on a Sparcstation-10/612)
and it also works fine there too! Same disk images as the Intel box,
boots right up, even with the four-disk structure.

DZ11 works fine under Solaris 8/Sparc and Intel.

Hello folks:

Stable Version:

Well, I got a good idea when I realize that my major developement takes
too long.  I divided into stable and developement versions.  I took
a latest version of TS10 from Tim's archives and added many bug fixes
and write operations to TS10 emulator.  Also I removed unfinished VAX 
emulator from stable version so that it now is in developement version.
I tested it and it worked fine. Then I released a stable version back to 
public.  I now have ftp account.  You can get a stable version from my new 
ftp site.  That is KS10 emulator only at this time.

Known Bugs: TOPS-20 v4.1 is working fine but...  When I attempts to log 
off, I got PAGLCK BUGHLT message.  Does anyone resolve that problem by
trying that stable version?

ftp://ftp.firesword7.net/pub/ts10/stable/ts10-fixed.tgz

Developement Version:

I still am working on device mapping and MSCP disk controller.  I had
rewrite entire device mapping structure and elimanated DEVICE and UNIT
structures by replacing new MAP_DEVICE, individually xxx_DEVICE, etc..
It almost was finished.  It took long time to complete.

I intially implemented MSCP disk controller (RQDX3) with initialization
sequence.  I ran MicroVAX II to test it.  It seems working fine.  It
sumbitted GO bit to execute MSCP packets according to my debug log file.
I learned something about Q22 Memory Space.   I learned that VMB set 
ringbase address as location 520 (0x150).  I looked into main memory
but...  I tried 30000150 by dump command and found MSCP packets.  There
are one response slot and one command slot.  I looked to its opcode.
It was "Set Controller Characteristics Command" opcode.  VMB am waiting
for complete process from RQDX3.

I was so amazed about that because Q22 Memory Space is mirror-effect when
I dumped contents by VAX address (starting 30000000)! :-)

Soon I will put latest version (unfinished yet) into developement
directory...

I figure I'm not the only one that's been wanting some TECO doc's.

Thanks to someone on the CLASSICCMP mailing list pointing out that the TECO
manual available at the Sunsite PDP-11 Archive is for the PDP-10, PDP-8,
PDP-11, and VAX-11, I've now got it available on the PDP-10 Emulation
webpage under Applications Documentation.  I've got an Adobe Acrobat copy
for easy printing as well as the original text copy.

http://www.aracnet.com/~healyzh/pdp10emu.html

I've also got the TECO Pocket Guide for the PDP-8, PDP-10 and PDP-11.  I'll
be scanning it in the next time I have my scanner hooked up.

Good news!  latest version of TS10 emulator is now available in
my ftp site - ftp://ftp.firesword7.net/pub/ts10/stable/ts10-fixed.tgz.
It now support write operations for tape units.  I decided to split
my ts10 emulators into stable and development stages and released
stable version with bug fixes.

Thank you!

I use four steps:

1.  Use the Infozip "ZIP" distribution (see

  ftp://ftp.process.com/vms-freeware/fileserv/zip.zip and install
  on your VAX)

with the "-V" (you have to put the option in quotes because
it's upper case) to Zip the .TPC file up *with* RMS record length
info included.  For example:

  $ ZIP "-V" MYTAPE.ZIP MYTAPE.TPC

2.  FTP the resulting .ZIP file to a Unix box.

3.  Unzip to get the .TPC on the Unix box.  The Unix box doesn't
have RMS, obviously, but the resulting file will have embedded
16-bit-wide record lengths before each record.

4.  Now use Bob Supnik's "mtcvtv23" utility to make a .TAP,
which has 32-bit-wide record lengths before and after each tape record
(unless there was a tape mark, in which case it's just a zero.)

In case you don't have mtcvtv23.c, just cut and paste from below:

[shoppa@mudd shoppa]$ more mtcvtv23.c

Ah, now this is the news I've been waiting for.  Have you tried running
TOPS-20 V7.0 on it?  Personally I'm not to worried, at this time, about
running TOPS-10 under KL10 emulation since we can do that on a KS10
emulator.  However, TOPS-20 is a different matter, and the V7.0 tapes look
to be the most complete.

What devices are you currently supporting on the KL10 emulation, and what
devices do you plan on supporting?

There is good news about KLH10.

I have in mind the SIMH emulation of the PDP-8/E. It emulates one KL8E 
and four KL8JA, with KSR-33 everyone. If I understand good, don't worry 
to have for my purposes KL8JA's or PT08's. The unique difference appears 
to be that one supports KSR33, and the PT08 the ASR33. Right ? 
Could be needed to emulate the PT08, KL8JA, KSR33 and ASR33 in different 
ways ? Is it sufficient with the KL8JA emulation in functional terms ?

What was the usual limit ? TSS/8 appears capable to use 32 of them.
Was there a limit in IOT's that could be used ? Was this applied to 
the KL8JA too ?

This is very interesting. It appears to be more easy to implement than 
the PT08's... (?)
Now I only need a little explain about how managed TSS/8 the PT08 
or 681 connection. In the manual says something about direct support 
for this last device.

It can be interesting to learn something more about this matter, of course. 
Can you do it ? Thanks a lot !

Greetings

Tim,
	I got TS10 working on Solaris Intel by doing
the following:

Removing the check for bytes=0 when reading from STDIN.
For whatever reason, read was returning 0 for STDIN and
would cause TS10 to exit.

Removing the setup for ~(ICANON || ECHO) and removing
the tcgetattr and tcsetattr setups. I also removed
the echo of each character read from STDIN. Therefor,
the net result is that TS10 gets an entire line at once.
This is no big deal, and works quite well, since you don't
have to pick up backspace/delete yourself.

The only remaining thing is after doing a "boot mta0:",
then telnetting into port 5000, I have to hit a few keys
before output is sent. Such that, I have to key in "/tm02"
and after hitting the second or third character, finally,
I get the BTM> prompt.

great!

These changes are not fully tested, so use at your own risk; these
changes were made solely to ensure compilation. No guarantees or
accuracies are expressed or implied :-)

The following files were updated:
  Mk-solsparc.mk
  dpni20.c
  osdnet.c
  osdnet.h

Changes were made to support the SUN C compiler, multiple cast
changes, struct references, removing the "#warning", and #if'ed out
calls to include sys/ethernet.h and netinet/arp.h

Many thanks to Ken and others for making this available. It sure
brought back lots of memories of a past life.

Look at in pdp10/fe.c for password.  You need change KLINK password in 
fe.c and re-compile it.

Hello folks:

I have a copy of 30-day eval Intel C++ 5.0 compiler today.  I tried it 
with my TS10 emulator.  It resulted much faster than using GCC compiler!

With stable version, it complaint about inline that cause mass undefined
symbols during link.  I had removed all 'inline' from them and 
successfully compiled it into 'ts10'.  I ran it and looked into debug.log.
I was so impressed.  Now it is 9.8 MIPS on 1.9 GHz P4.  I studied -help
information and tried with -tpo option.  (Multi-file optimization).
I successfully compiled it by using -tpo.  It cause big boost exceeding 10 
MIPS!  Now it is 12 MIPS!

Tested with TOPS-10 7.04 on TS10 emulator (stable version):

Compilation options   Result
-----------------------------
gcc -O3              8.3 MIPS
icc -O3              9.8 MIPS
icc -O3 -tpo          12 MIPS

Now I am satisfied with Intel C++ compiler for better optimization, etc.
Some day, I will buy Intel C++ compiler after 30 day eval.

Well, I still am developing the PDP-10 emulator but I have some problems 
with my VAX emulator (two serious bugs had been found recently).  After 
bugs had been fixed, NetBSD/vax now boots normally and OpenVMS still 
crashes the same. :-(  (Two bugs in memory access and recovery queues
during fault)

There is a copy of stable version of PDP10 emulator on my FTP site.
(ftp://ftp.firesword7.net/pub/ts10/stable)

Thank you for your patience.

To answer the specific question asked some 15 or so replies back:

Macs have no problem displaying or printing monospaced text files.

They have even less problems now that MacOS X is out, since it's UNIX under
the hood.  You can either look at a file in TextEdit (a GUI-based text file
viewer) or just open a Terminal window and use standard Unix tools to deal
with the file.

As to the "nothing interesting" question: Apple and the Mac have had quite
a resurgence in the past few years.  And while there's still a lot of
software that's consigned to the "runs in Classic ghetto (old-style MacOS
running as a process under MacOS X in a virtual machine style emulator)",
there's more and more stuff coming out every day for MacOS X.  If you're a
Unix fan, there's a project that's been porting literally hundreds of Open
Source programs to Darwin (the underlying FreeBSD/Mach UNIX underneath
MacOS X), along with thousands of traditional Mac titles that now run on
MacOS X.


And back to PDP-10 land: with some help from a former TOPS-10 developer I
work with, the KLH-10 emulator now runs, in single-process form, under
MacOS X.

(Multi-process form will have to wait either until Darwin fully supports
SysV shared memory or I or someone else converts KLH to use POSIX shared
memory.)

That's wierd!  BTW, you might want to look at the following page:
http://www.bsp-gmbh.com/hercules/herc_mvs2.html  It has an ISO image for a
CD that sets up a prebuilt Hercules setup.

Once again thanks to the efforts of Ronald Tatum there is a manual for 
METAS online at the PDP-10 Emulation Webpage. 
http://www.aracnet.com/~healyzh/pdp10emu.html

While this manual looks to be for a IBM 360/44, the manual is there as META S
was used in implementing ALGOL-W on the PDP-10.

Yup... but the linux emulation may be a bit large to pack on the floppy
with ts10.

A bootable CDROM with FreeBSD, ts10 and an emulated writeprotected
master TOPS10 and TOPS20 pack would be slick.  Mount an old writeable
500mb IDE as a couple of RP06's... automagically copy the images over if
the structures are noth there and run.

I'll take a look at building a custom 4.5 with ts10, though.

Yes, time for V2.9 beta, on http://simh.trailing-edge.com.  The
VAX/SDS test code is also V2.9 based.  Because of API changes, V2.8
and V2.9 sources cannot be intermixed.

New in V2.9: something for everyone (comedy tonight).

1. PDP11/PDP10/VAX: multiboard DZ emulation.  The DZ simulator can now
be configured with up to 32 lines, representing 4 separate DZ's.  (It
can probably go to 64, but enough for now.)

2. PC queues: for debugging, simulators now keep a queue of the last
64 PC changes, rather than just one.

3. Consistent device configuration.  The ENABLE/DISABLE and ADD/REMOVE
commands have been replaced by:

	SET <device> ENABLED/DISABLED
	SET <unit> ONLINE/OFFLINE

Where appropriate, device addresses or numbers can be changed; this is
simulator specific.  Note that the write enable command is now

	SET <unit> WRITEENABLED

4. Multiple calibrated timers.  Instead of just the real-time clock, a
simulator can implement up to 8 calibrated timers.

5. All terminal multiplexors implement new commands:

	SHOW <dev> STATISTICS
	SET <dev> DISCONNECT=line

The latter is for booting individual users off.

6. HP2100.  A bunch of new devices implemented and bugs fixed (thanks
to help from Bill McDermith).

7. Altair Z80.  Compilation problems on Windoze fixed (thanks to Peter
Schorn).

8. The usual minor bug fixes and cosmetic improvements.

The VAX is still stuck trying to bring up VMS following successful
installation of the hobbyist image.  The Interdata 16/32 are written
but not tested, ditto the SDS 940, and the GRI 909 is waiting for more
documentation.

There is a working tape of Wollongong UNIX (V7) for the Interdata 32b
systems.  There may also be images of Interdata's own RTOS's.

There are sources to Project Genie, the original 940 timesharing
system.  It is a very difficult exercise to figure out how to
reconstruct a running system from that.

Nothing for the GRI-909 except the crystal growing program I wrote for
it back in 1972.

Being in the simulator console is equivalent to halting the system.
Nothing is running on the target (simulated) system.  Time stops, the
clock loses interrupts, terminals don't respond, etc.  The
"unobtrusive" way to kick off a user is to do so using the facilities
of the simulated operating system.

Some number of additional terminals won't be a problem, but the PDP-8
only has 64 device numbers, each discrete terminal interface takes 2,
so 32 individual interfaces aren't possible.  I thought the maximum
number supported was 19.

Try the -DNO_INLINE function.  Peter made some key routines inline,

will compile on VC++.

Doug Jones has a PDP-8 emulator that puts up a nice looking
front panel in X-Windows. IIRC, there is a way to open another
xterm and type at it like it was the teletype connected to 
the PDP-8.

a) Not all PDP-10s were microcoded (KA-10 and KI-10)


b) Exchanging microcode for an other instruction set amounts to de-10-ing
the 10. It is the specific 36bit instruction set that makes it a 10.

Reusing the microengine for something else (AFAIK there was an IBM 360
done for the KL-10 microengine) is just an recycled 10, not an real 10
any more.

OTOH taking an other microengine (say an Intel x86) and writing an
microcode for the specific 36bit instruction set makes the result an
10, allthough not an genuine DEC one.


> There a gcc C compiler for it?

That is what NetBSD is using. Was originally ported for under TOPS-20.

Personally, I see little use in running UNIX on a PDP-10.  I recognize
that it has hack value.  However, most PDP-10s these days are microcoded
on platforms that can run UNIX much more effectively in native mode.
Even using klh10, an x86 CPU will run software 30+ times faster in native
mode than as a PDP-10 (and that's damn good, since 100x is more typical).

What is far more interesting is running software that can't be run on
anything other than a PDP-10.

Which brings me to my main point.  It seems that TOPS-20 and ITS have been
relatively well-preserved.  At least a dozen TOPS-20 systems are in 24/7
production on the net today.  The barrier against production ITS systems
is not as much technical as political; the Internet is a much more hostile
place today than it was then ITS systems roamed the each.

But what about the other PDP-10 operating systems?  We can say that Tenex
effectively lives on TOPS-20.  However, all we seem to have from TOPS-10
are the DEC distributions.  The Internet version of TOPS-20 (CMU, Harvard,
LLL, WPAFB) seems to have vanished from the earth.

Even sadder, repeated inquiries about WAITS have turned up nothing.  That
was a truly unique and special environment.  Most production work on ITS
came to an end after the 1970s, but WAITS was actively used until 1991.

For a good rundown on emulation, as well as pointers to pretty much any
information that is available about the PDP-10 you can try my website. 
http://www.aracnet.com/~healyzh/decemu.html 

I think the basic rundown is 3 publically available emulators, one
commercially available system, and two projects to implement the PDP-10 in
FPGA.  For OS's TOPS-10, TOPS-20, and ITS are available, sadly the rest
appear to be lost in the mists of time.

As other people have pointed out, klh10 has been run on a Sharp Zaurus.

I think that there is such a thing as too small.  I can't imagine doing
useful PDP-10 work on a Zaurus, while I have done so on a Sony VAIO
Picturebook.  5 times a KL10, 3 times an XKL-1.

I think that what is more interesting is price/performance.  I think that
lingling.panda.com, built for $700 of commodity hardware and benchmarked
at 16 times a KL10 (10 times an XKL-1) is the current leader.  I'm sure
that if I built Lingling today, I would get an even faster system (I used
an Athlon 1700).  Nevertheless, Lingling is impressive.  It builds the
TOPS-20 monitor from sources in 12.5 minutes!

I'm not sure what the current status of Tim's TS10 is;
last I recall, he was working on VAX simulation for the
package. Also available: SIMH, and Ken Harrentstein's
KLH-10.

For SIMH, go to

    http://simh.trailing-edge.com

and for KLH10, go to

    http://klh10.trailing-edge.com

For KLH10, ready-build versions of TOPS-10 7.04 and
ITS are available. For SIMH, I don't see a ready-to-run
filesystem, but TOPS-10 7.03 has proven to be pretty
easy to install, but I haven't done an install in almost
a year now...

My DEC Emulation website has most of the info you'll need.  Be forwarned, I
think I've got a bunch of stale links.  Unfortuantly I've not had the time
to go through and check them like I need to.  As a result you'll probably
need to go directly to Tim Shoppa's site to grab the tape images.

My site can be found at:
http://www.aracnet.com/~healyzh/pdp10emu.html
I've got pages on all emulated DEC architectures, however, the PDP-10 is the
most complete (and it's also the original portion).

For an emulator I'd recommend SIMH for TOPS-10 and KLH10 for TOPS-20. 
Though you should probably take a look at the current state of Tim Starks
work, as I've not keep up with it (I think he's mainly been concentrating on
his VAX emulator of late).

Hello folks:

I noticed that on '4 days until Dec 10' articles.  Yes, I still am working
on my ts10 emulator.
Latest snapshots are at ftp.firesword7.net/pub/ts10/develop.  I plan to
update it on sourceforge soon.

I ported my latest version of ts10 emulator to Intel C/C++ 7.0 compiler and
successfully compiled it into an exe file.  Comparsion with GCC v3.2 on Red
Hat Linux 8.0 (on 1.9 Ghz P4 system with 512 MB PC800 RIMM modules).   My
ts10 emulator has three complete working emulators, pdp10, pdp11, and vax.

Section        GCC v3.2        Intel C/C++ v7.0 with -ipo option
PDP10        8.5 MIPS        10 MIPS
PDP11        5.7 MIPS        8.5 MIPS
VAX           5.0 MIPS        5.0 MIPS  (Peak MIPS is 7.1 MIPS)

I finished my VAX emulator and am now working on TMSCP tape drives for VAX
and PDP11 in progress.  DELQA emulation worked fine.  NetBSD and OpenVMS
operating system worked
fine on it.  Also, I implemented TSV05 emulation and was able restore my old
tapes that I saved on the University's real VAX systems.

In PDP11 emulator, ts10 supports boot controller (BDV11) for KDF11 processor
but I still am looking for MRV11 specs because KDJ11 rom image is not
compatible with BDV11 boot controller.  There still is a bug somewhere in
KDJ11 emulator that cause unexpected odd address trap.  However, KDF11
emulator worked fine with running XXDP 2.5 operating system.

Also, I am working on IBM 370/390 emulator and others.  I was able to boot
ZZSA editor on IBM 370 emulator with using x3270 terminal software.

Well, I am re-implementing my new PDP-10 emulator from scratch to replace my
old PDP-10 emulator because it consumes my time too much.  That's why I had
to re-write it to implement many new macros to save my working time alot.
For example, I implemented the main function for several similar
instructions (SKIP, SKIPL, SKIPE, SKIPLE, SKIPA, SKIPGE, SKIPN, and SKIPG)
by using DEF_SKIP(name, opskip) macro.  Also, I now use a pair of halfword
instead of whole 64-bit integer for better performance because alot of
shifts eats CPU cycles alot.
There are many halfmove instructions, etc., I can take advantage of a pair
of halfwords easily.
For example for simple HLRO instruction:

DEF_INST(kx10, HLRO)
{
    w10 w = ReadV(ea);
    w.rh = w.lh;
    w.lh = H10_MASK;
    WriteAC(ac, w);
}

Thank you!
Tim Stark

I've put an update to the Interdata simulators on
http://simh.trailing-edge.com.  The simulator now runs many of the
Interdata diagnostics, both 16b and 32b, and is beta ready.  My next
step is to try the UNIX V6 and V7 ports.

I've also posted some new manuals on SIMH to the web site
documentation section.  These include:

- an update to SIMH internals manual
- a new manual on IO structure of the most popular simulators
- a new manual on magtape representation and error handling

I don't want anyone passing out from shock, but I've just done a semi-decent
job of going through my PDP-10 Emulation webpage, and have gotten most of
the dead links updated.

http://www.aracnet.com/~healyzh/pdp10emu.html

I've already posted about Arthur Krewat's site being missing, unfortunatly
it looks like http://pdp10.nocrew.org/ might be missing as well (hopefully
it's just down temporarily).

Tim, you used to have a PDF copy of the "TOPS-10 Commands Manual V7.01" manual
available at mudd.trailing-edge.com, is it available anywhere?

I'll see about getting the page updated to reflect all the excellent
documentation that Al has made available.

Actually it simply predates the CISC "detour". The extended PDP10
(KL-10) made in midst of the CISC days had a few strongly CISCy
additions (all the string stuff).

RISC ist mainly defined as any architecture where instructions are
included or excluded on whether they are "reduced complex", i.e. they
can be implemented without getting in the way of the rest of the
instructions.

So stuff that speeds one specific (sub-)job 10 times, but adds 10%
time to all other (sub-)jobs get throun out, if it is not used often
enough to speed up by 10% to offset that.


Main "show stoppers" are things that stall the pipeline by needing
data that has not been prefetched (usually because it is only known
to be needed too late) or lengthen the basic clock cycle (usually by
requiring complex decoders).

The PDP10 EA calculation hits on both these places. The culprint is
the indirect bit (bit 13, whose number which is very appropriate :-)).

a) it forces an memory read of the indirect address, whose address of
that address it is only known after the memory access direct before it.
So the pipeline stalls for the full time until memory answers. A "slow"
100MHz (=10ns per cycle) running from 100ns memory (that is full memory
access cycle) falls to 10% speed if that happens constantly. A 200MHZ
processor is already down to 5% speed with same memory.

b) even after reading the word coming back, it may have I bits in it
(for double/multiple indirect), so the data can not be immediately
used but needs first looking at. So this is an case of waiting for
decoder.

This only applies to using I. The X indexed stuff is only fast memory
indirect (so no access time trouble), and only max one indirection (so
can be rolled out into hardware (an X=0 driven multiplexer that takes
Y or Y+F(X)).

So it is even a case of:  AND 2,3(0)  is fast and good, while
AND 2,@3  is slow and bad!


And yes, trying to minimise the impact of such indirect addressing is
one of the headaches any fast PDP10 maker (such as FPGS cloners) has
got to address, if maximal speed is wanted.

This means trying to detect the difference of  AND 2,@3  (which can
be speeded up) and  AND 2,@333  (which can not) and speeding up the
just the later.

But such detection (a 14bit comparison) slows down basic instruction
decoding, thus we have again the "how often" trouble. Does speeding
AND 2,@3  up by 3-10% (is even dependant on memory speed!) save more
time than slowing all non-@ instructions by about 1%?

It is something from deep within your "guy thing" category.

I don't know either what he meant by this. Peripherals usually are not
relevant for CPU instruction speed. Nor for CPU classification.

It is not about reduced count, but reduced complexity. This
missunderstanding is actually quite widely spread.

Or rather the host processor running the emulator program. It goes
into pipeline stalls, even if it has an pipeline friendly architecture.

Software can kill any pipeline. Processors can only offer software
(usually the compiler) the chance of avoiding this trouble. An
emulator for an non-pipelinable processor will allways stall its host
processor.

As seen in above  AND  examples. PDP10s can be programmed pipeline
friendly or pipeline stalling. But lots of software prefers I over
X usage, because it is simpler (and surely faster on the simple
microcoded KS-10, possibly the complex microcoded KL-10 had some
"dirty trick" to make it same speed) and more universal (anywhere
in memory, not just addresses 01-17).

So fast PDP10 makers have to try to optimise at least some common
cases, at cost of chip space, and clock speed.


I can only hope that the gcc compiler port uses X over I as often as
possible (or can be changed to in future optimise its code in this
way).

But then, X is slower than I on old some traditional microcoded
processors, but X is faster than I on FPGAs, and I don't know what
KI-10 did here (could be both ways).

So this needs to be an target processor model dependant selectable
option to the compiler! That would be -mtune=... option to gcc/pdp10,
for those that want to know. Thanks to Lars for putting that option
in, it will be needed one day in the future.

What ever the emulated target architecture does.

Yes. PDP10 is quite good on many aspects. But the central RISC stuff
is not one of them. That "I" bit is the worst anti-RISC thing one can do.

Hello all,

The ts10 emulator now is multi-system emulator system that have three
individual working emulaors: PDP-10 (KS10/KL10), PDP-11 (KDF11/KDJ11), and
VAX (KA630/KA655).  I am considering to implement module support routines to
load module files into ts10's memory space by using dlopen function call.
What are advantages and disadvantages about modules and performance because
dynamic links are new to me?

About new version of PDP-10 emulator, I implemented most instructions execpt
mul/div, EXTEND, floating, and byte pointer instructions that are not
finished yet.  I currently am working on pager systems.  I successfully ran
ksboot.exe on it.

You know that I now am using a pair (two left/right halfwords of 36-bit
word).  I created new data types: a10 (30-bit PDP-10 address), h10 (18-bit
word), w10 (36-bit word), and op10 (36-bit operators).  About multiply and
divide operators, I am figuring out how to implement multiply and divide
operators by using a pair (36-bit word).  With w10 data type, it have data
structure:
"typedef struct { h10 lh, rh; } w10;".  Because of w10 data type, I have to
create op10 inline macros like op10_and, op10_xor, op10_or,  op10_add, etc.
Also, I am using multi-instruction inline macros much like matrix to save my
development and debugging time alot.

Thank you!
Tim Stark

Welcome back...

They've got 3 TOPS-10 emulators running now...

TS10, KLH10 and the SIMH emulator.

The last one works out pretty well under Windows and the others 
work ok under FreeBSD/Solaris/Linux...

The worst injury I had while doing my old reporter job involved a whack
or two by someone against my long lens while shooting pix for the local
weekly rag here in Central NJ.

Sorry to hear about the pain.

You'll probably want to check out my website, as it has pointers to
everything you'll need for PDP-10 emulation.

It was a bit more than that.  I sort of remember it.  It included a
fair amount of Macro-10 code and was able to simulate a Unix shell
including pipelines (I think it used temp files for that), and it
simulated the Unix file system (including directory structure) by
using one big file on the host OS as a virtual "disk drive" that it
did its own file and block allocation etc. inside of.  It also
included asm code for other machines/OS's to make the Ratfor
applications portable to some other systems including maybe VM/370.
It was quite an interesting hack, though I don't know if it was really
practical.

I wrote a lot of Ratfor code under Compuserve's mutant strain of
Tops-10, though not using the Virtual OS layer.  The Ratfor stuff was
really pretty cool it really did feel a lot like Unix/C programming on
a PDP-11.  Whether that's good or bad is of course a matter of taste.

Sounds like someone took the Software Tools code and went a little nuts
with it on the -10. The version I had had a shell, supporting pipelines with
temp files, but very little of it was in assembly and most was in as
portable FORTRAN as the authors could manage.

It was *definitely* practical. I used it as my shell in RSX-11 for years.

That list was as of 1980.  Things didn't stop then.  It stated that
"most supported at least the RATFOR preprocessor and the I/O primitives"
not that they only supported that part.  All of the systems I used
were complete environments by 1983.

For another perspective try looking at:

Fair enough. I used it in various incarnations but never later than 1983,
and all of them used native files. The encapsulated file system does seem
a little impractical.

>My whole point is that all this work was done.  All this work was lost.

I think that's far too strong a statement.

The Software Tools VOS was developed by people at Bell Labs and later
Berkeley to provide a UNIX "Software Tools" environment on non-UNIX systems.
These people were also working on both AT&T and BSD UNIX. The origin was
the book "Software Tools" by Kernighan and Plaugher, and I put my first
Software Tools environment together by typing in and porting the listings
in that book and getting them to work on RSX. I had no idea, at first,
that there was a tape available. :)

The second Software Tools book was in Pascal, and unfortunately missing a
lot of the content of the first book.

The third "Software Tools Book" isn't called "Software Tools". Instead, it's
titled "The UNIX Programming Environment". Which tells you what eventually
happened with the Software Tools VOS.

It's not "lost". It's simply merged back into the
UNIX family.

What are the tools?

	ar, cat, cmp, crypt, date, dc, diff, echo, ed, expand, man, mv, pr
	rev, rm, sort, spell, split, tail, tee, tr, tsort, uniq, wc, and sh

		These are all versions of the UNIX tools.

	tcs

		SCCS

	ch

		a subset of sed, a superset of gres.

	cpress

		compress (pack, gzip, ...)

	crt

		a primitive "more"

	detab,entab

		Similar to the unix utility "col".

	ed,edin

		member of the ed/ex/... family

	find,fb

		something between grep and sed

	field

		join/split/...

	format

		nroff

	ratfor

		ratfor

	kwic

		This went into the BSD tapes.

	lam

		This is an interesting tool for joining files, and the
		first part of the system that doesn't have a
		close cousin on the BSD tapes. Kind of trivial to
		implement with other tools these days.

	ll	awk 'BEGIN { longest=0; shortest=0 }
		     shortest == 0 || len($0) < shortest { shortest = len($0) }
		     len($0) > longest { longest = len($0) }
		     END { print shortest, longest }'

	macro

		m4

	mcol

		another subset of awk

	os

		col

	pl

		a tiny subset of awk and/or sed

	sedit

		sed

	show

		make a file printable, nothing exactly equivalent but
		it's close

Later versions had more tools, but all of them were of a similar character:
providing a UNIX environment for non-UNIX systems.

>And all this work has been re-invented by people who think they are

The people who "re-invented" it were often the people who invented it in
the first place, and most of them invented it on UNIX first.

A number of years ago Bob Supnik (then still a VP at Digital (or
whatever it was called at the time)) gave a talk about the SIMH
project (and the latest generation Alpha chips) at the Tech Square
"Playroom".

I was waiting to talk to him; I had a DECtape in a green box that was
labled as PDP-15 system software(*) (at the time none was known to
have survived).  The person before me had a 2400' 1/2" tape they said
was a 7-track containing dumps of PDP-1 DECtapes.  Bob seemed less
than interested when it was confirmed that the software depended on
MIT hardware modifications (i.e. 2's complement arithmetic).

I've also been told someone at MIT may have a 7-track with CTSS on it.

Last time I asked him, Tim Shoppa was willing to read such tapes if
the results could be made publicly available.

If you have one of the above tapes (or know someone who does), please
think about getting the tape read!!

(*) The tape in the box turned out to be in PDP-11 format, and to
contain some RSX-11 related stuff.

The KLH10 emulator seems to have a mere 40x performance hit compared to
the native hardware when doing Dhrystones.  Roughly, my experience is that
you get a KL10 equivalent in performance for each 100MHz of native CPU, so
KLH10 running on a dedicated 700 MHz PIII should be about 7 times a KL10.

Of course, the PDP-10 architecture is much easier to implement quickly
than the VAX.

In the days of old iron we were always trying to get faster processors.
None of us would thought of deliberately slowing things down.

16x KL speed isn't really that great a performance jump.  It basically
brings us up to 1990 vintage performance; Lingling is comparable to a PMAX
running Ultrix.  And indeed, by 1990 the last few KLs still running were
looking pretty sad.

We had many processors of differing speeds along the way.  I see Lingling
as simply another of the tradition, somewhat behind the curve but much
further along than the XKL or SC machines.

Now, we do have certain advantages; we've also missed the past 20 years of
bloatware.  Lingling finally represents a PDP-10 processor that is
competant to run Lisp (which for a KL was bloatware).

Hours.  Something like 3 hours on a KL, overnight on a KS.

Actually, the files that were slow to compile were all the DECnet-36 stuff
with its intensive use of macros.  That junk came from the TOPS-10 losers
as I recall; it's cluelessness about TOPS-20 sure looks that way (e.g. the
NMXTIM routine).

I don't remember who did DECnet in the -20 monitor.  IIRC, DECnet
per se didn't go into the -20 monitor until phase IV with the
ethernet implementation.  The previous releases were MCB-based
DECnet.  The MCB got done first on the -20, then it came over
to the -10.  We hired our own to do ethernet and they didn't
work on the -20.

SIMH/VAX 2.10-2 Win32 binaries *with* Ethernet:

http://www.tubas.net/~kstailey/simh/

Requires winpcap.

http://winpcap.polito.it/install/bin/WinPcap_3_0_a4.exe

from 

http://winpcap.polito.it/install/default.htm

since the packet capture drives are not bundled.

For network documentation get the SIMH source code from

http://simh.trailing-edge.com/

and look through it for readme's and *.txt.

To test if winpcap is running OK get WinDump from

http://windump.polito.it/

and run "WinDump -D".  It should print the name of any network cards
you have similar to this:

1.\Device\NPF_El90x1 (3Com 3C90x Ethernet Adapter)

If you don't see that you might need to replace the Packet.dll that is
in my ZIP file.  Look for replacements at the bottom of this page:

http://winpcap.polito.it/contact.htm

Once you have that working you should use name from "WinDump -D" in a
SIMH "attach" command to tell SIMH to map your network card to the
virtual DELQA.  Given the name from the previous example the attach
command would be:

ATTACH XQ \Device\NPF_El90x1

It is not well documented but the author of SIMH gave up trying to
shove a VT-100 emulator in the Windows binary and put a command to use
telnet to gain control of the console.  Use

set telnet <port>

After that command, telnet into the emulator console and then type
"boot cpu" from the non-telnet session and the system will boot with
console output going to the telnet one.

There is a minor update to SIMH on http://simh.trailing-edge.com.  The
principal differences:

1. Fixes to the PDP-15 to run DOS-15.
2. Additional breakpoint capabilities.

If you are not planning on running DOS-15, there are no functional
differences from 2.10-2.

Hans Pufal has completed the restoration of DOS-15, including fixing a
30+ year old operating system bug that prevented use of a maximum
RF15/RS09 configuration.  For details, please see Hans' web page at

http://www.aconit.org/hbp/PDP9/DOS

The distribution kit for DOS-15 is on the SIMH web site, under
software kits.

Here is my current understanding of the tests to determine between various
forms of PDP-10 processor.  I am lacking code to test for:

	Foonly F1, F3, F4
	Tymshare 26KL
	Systems Concepts SC20, SC30, SC40
	KX10 emulator
	SIMH emulator

Can anyone help fill in some of the missing tests?

Last time I posted, I was running ITS, with new drivers for modern (16c450
console, ATA disk) emulated peripherals, on the high-level model
(micromachine register-level emulation, emulating the real microcode).

I've been very busy with other things (both work related and non-work
related), but I'm pretty much at this state on a low-level model (registers
and control equations) as well. Most of the work getting to this state was
redesigning the micropipeline, taking time from the ALU and giving it to the
AC RAM address calculation and read access (the former is pretty complicated
since it needs to deal with PXCT various +N operations). There are still
three microinstructions in flight at the same time, but I did need to add a
bypass for the micro-condition-codes so that a branch right after an ALU
operation got to use the *new* codes (a similar case already existed for the
EA<20 check to avoid needed a hazard-avoiding NOP in the main indirect
address calculation flow).

Recently I been thinking about packaging, and looking at some routing and
signal integrity issues, mainly on the 32Kx8 SRAMS which make up the control
store.

I've got a webpage that should point you to everything you'll need.
http://www.aracnet.com/~healyzh/pdp10emu.html
The page has pointers to emulators, software, and documentation (actually
the page has pointers to just about every piece of PDP-10 related info on
the web).

BTW, TWENEX isn't available, but TOPS-20 is.  TOPS-20 V7 on KLH10 is quite
nice!

This seems conservative to me.  I get closer to 100MHz to equal a KL10, so
1GHz is about 10x KL10 speed.

Simply go to the following webpage:
http://www.aracnet.com/~healyzh/pdp10emu.html

There are links to everything you need.  I recommend using the Monitor
Install Guides rather than the cheat sheets that I and others have written
up.

As far as I know, all the links are up to date, I've not had time to check
them lately.

Oh, as for the best emulator, I prefer SIMH for TOPS-10 and KLH10 for
TOPS-20 (I have yet to find the time to figure out ITS).

Any chance this was the TOPS-20 portion?

Many thanks!!!!!!!!

I had missed the fact that STRUCTURE-QUOTAS was not defined in these new
users' profiles and that that was the key to getting the search list set up
too.  BTW, you would think this stuff would be in Operator's Command Manual
as you suggest, but in fact it's hidden within the Monitor Installation
Guide (MIG)...

Turned out it was a bit more complex than just adding DSKB to the
STRUCTURE-QUOTAS as I also had to struggle through figuring out how to
CATALOG the structure first with OPR ("%REASNC, Structure not cataloged").

But now all is well ... learning more about ancient operating systems than I
ever needed to know :)

Thanks again for pointing me in the right direction !

Ok, I will look into that and will fix bugs.  Thank you for let me know
about new bugs in MTA emulation.  Also, latest snapshots for both devel and
stable are available at ftp.firesword7.net/pub/ts10.  That version is
developement stage.  Try stable version and let me know what happens.

Thank you.

The TOPS-10 Monitor Installation Guide for 7.03 can be found at Zane
Healy's site:

http://www.aracnet.com/~healyzh/pdp10emu.html

There is also a pointer to the MIG for 7.04.  Both are accurate enough
to install a monitor from the trailing-edge.com archive tapes.  Note
that there is an install bug in 7.04 and a work-around for it; see the
SIMH PDP-10 documentation.

Sorry... wrong context.

There is a bug in 7.04 installation.  In counting the number of
magtape units, the code overflows the CSR field into the next bit,
which is the inhibit increment bit.  This impacted Tim's debugging of
TS10.  SIMH, in one of its rare simplifications, didn't implement the
inhibit increment bit, allowing 7.04 to work "properly".

Bob,

Yeah.  I am aware of that because I discovered a bug in TOPS-10 7.04 monitor
code.  I already fixed it by remove inhibit increment bit in TU emulation
code in MBA package before.  All problems disappeared.  Now TOPS-10 7.04 is
working so well on TS10 emulator right now.

And nearly a week later, most everything is back up.  Within seconds of the
mail service being enabled I was flooded with literally hundreds of connections
from spam and virus-infected Windows boxes, so mail is temporariliy off
until I can figure out how to throttle that junk, in preference of
keeping the various archives and Bob's SIMH stuff available.

There are still some major intersections without traffic lights near my
house, and several side roads still have down trees across them, but things
are getting cleared up.

I use TOPS-10 as well - And applying this manually to V3.0-1 it so far
works beautifully. I even saw it go down from 2% CPU time to 0.7% so,
looks good. It never went below 98% before.

Thanks! Saved my sanity for a while.

I use the following.  RP06.init assumes no disk image file (t20.dsk in mine),
sets up two tape drives with the installation tapes, and goes from there.
Afterwards, use RP06.boot to run with 32 terminals.

I change the interrupt character to ^\ (the standard on the KL-10, KS-10,
SC-30M, and Toad-1) from the default ^E (a bad choice for Tops-20, because
there is a set of privileged commands prefixed with ^E).

Have fun!

Hi all,

I discovered how to get a multi-disk boot structure working (TOPS-10 v7.04 on
simh). In all my googling I never saw a solution posted, so here is mine.
These are snippits from an installation log file. (The actual log is
rather big.)  My notes start with "=== ".

=== (In this example, logical unit 0 [DSKB0:] is RPA0:)

=== The trick is where you tell SMFILE to put the boot stuff.

=== (See Section 6.2 (page 6-6) of the Monitor Installation Guide.)
=== Where the MIG says to use the structure name (dskb:)
=== use the name of logical unit 0 (dskb0:) instead:

.r credir

Create directory: dskb0:[6,2020]/exit
  Created DSKB0:[6,2020].UFD/PROTECTION:775

.run dec:smfile


DECSYSTEM 2020 DIAGNOSTICS FE-FILE PROGRAM
VERSION 2.7, TOPS-10, KS10, CPU#=4097
[FOR HELP TYPE "HELP"]
SMFILE>write setup dskb0:
SMFILE>write reset
SMFILE>read dec:t10kl.ram
SMFILE>serial 4097
SMFILE>write cram
SMFILE>write boot dec:ksboot.exe
SMFILE>write done
SMFILE>exit

EXIT

.
=== Once you have finished the installation and rebooted, look at what
=== systat tells you:

.systat

Status of KS10 at 20:55:24 on 13-Oct-103

=== <SNIP systat for brevity>

System File Structures:
Name  Free  Mount
DSKB  1893740  2
Total Free 1893740

=== You have lots of disk, but not a lot of core. I haven't seen the solution
=== to using all of simh's available memory posted here (and I've googled
=== this subject to death, too) so I'll summarize what I found:
=== 0) Start Chapter 9 in the MIG.
=== 1) Answer MONGEN dialog question #58 (pg. 9-8 in the MIG) with 1024
=== 2) Complete Chapter 9 and reboot.
=== 3) From the OPR> prompt...

OPR>enter ? one of the following:

OPR>enter config
CONFIG>show hardware

Many thanks to those who've created the simulators and those who've made
the software and documentation available. I never had the chance to use
or play with either TOPS-10 or TOPS-20. This is cool stuff.

Hi, again,

I forgot one of those little details that when they bite, they bite
_hard_:

After the structure has been defined (during ONCE) several status messages
are printed. Among these is this:

% No units in active swapping list

Typing "show asl" gives:

Startup option: show asl

Swapping Units:
         Unit   UnitID  Class   Space (K)
        ------  ------  -----   ---------
         RPA0   DSKB0     0          4807
             (Memory size = 512K)


Huh. Well, changing the asl makes ONCE happy:

Startup option: change asl

Enter names of units to appear in the active swapping list,  one
per line.  Terminate list with a blank line.
rpa0

[Rebuilding the system dump list from the HOM blocks]

Sorry about the omission,

Mike
