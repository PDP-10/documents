Tym Stegner of cca did pick up on this thread over in c.o.v. but did
not cross-post back to a.s.p (as he reads by mail I'll take the
liberty of cross-posting back). Here's a couple of  Tym's comments.
Jump over to c.o.v.  (if you are reading this is a.s.p) for the actual
posts.

From the System 1022 User's Guide:

"System 1022 is general purpose data management software system that
operates on DECsystem-10 and DECSYSTEM-20 computers. [And now on
whatever
hardware emulates those OS's -TJS]

It is easy to use interactively and in sophisticated application
programs.
It is a tool that brings data base management to those who use the
data,
yet satisfies the needs of professional managers and application
system
designers.

Related data sets are easily linked for combined management and
reporting
of information.  System 1022 creates and updates large (and small)
data
collections.  A very fast retreival capability gives immediate access
to
data in the largest collections of records.  A comprehensive report
writer
displays this data with any level of formatting and analysis."


A companion product from the same vendor, Software House (formerly of
Cambridge, MA, USA); System 1032, was engineered from the ground up to
provide System 1022-like features on the newly introduced VAX/VMS
operating
system.


The *ACTUAL* origin of the System 1022/System 1032 product names are
lost
in the mists of time.  At least, *I've* never been able to get a clear
story from the original engineers.  Although, the above story is the
most
plausible i've come across...

This was the commonly accepted rational for the System 1022 name.  Any
of
the System 1022 developers would instantly gainsay it (though a better
rational was not provided).

I don't monitor this group at all, in fact, I didn't know that it
existed until a former 1022 co-worker pointed it out to me yesterday.
Pursuant to this message and to the thread at large,
a common guess that the name is borne of 10s and 20s, 
is undone by the fact that when 1022 was developed there were 
no DEC20s, only 10s. :(
I worked w/ SH co-founders Andy Garland and Charlie Houseman 
for about 10 years. Although I asked them and other co-workers,
AFAIK they never revealed the source of the name.

Re: expiration date, it's not entirely straightforward 
to defeat the date checking mechanism in that version,
since the date is checked in several stages, at different places 
in the code, some of which happened at random times.
If memory serves, there was one customer whose license 
required a copy that never expired, for whom I was directed 
to write a patch to JFCL out the expiration checks. 
No, I didn't keep a copy of the patch, so don't ask.
