Well I appear to have gotten Decwar v2.2 to sort of run on both simh-10
and ts10.  The exe file I have was apparently modified and corrupted or
corrupted and modified :-)  DDT commands are coming back out of long
unused memory.

There seems to be slight differences in the floating point behaviors of the 
two emulators.  I'll be trying to narrow down what those differences are
over the next few weeks (time permitting).  For those familiar with Decwar
commands the relative coordinates sometimes mess up or don't work at all -
implying some kind of rounding issue.  Absolute coordinates always work.

Anyway here is a blast from the past:

Star @13-13 novas
 
Star @13-13 makes 0.0 unit hit on Fed Base displaced to 11-15, +70.2%
 
Romulan @19-12 +44.4% makes 448.8 unit torpedo hit on
Fed Base @11-15, +33.9%

Command: BU R -1 -1
 
Demon builds planet @2-21 into a Emp Base
 
Romulan @15-13 +44.4% makes 323.1 unit phaser hit on
Fed Base @11-15, +29.3%
 
Romulan @11-14 +25.8% makes 479.1 unit phaser hit on
Fed Base @11-15, +21.9%
 
Fed Base @11-15, +21.9% makes 366.0 unit phaser hit on Romulan @11-14
Romulan DESTROYED!!
 
Command: TO 3 11 15
 
Demon @5-16, +100.0% makes 7.8 unit torpedo hit on

Command: $
 
Demon @5-16, +100.0% makes 992.2 unit torpedo hit on

If you look in http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/www/lib10/0536/

You will find a DECWAR.EXE/HLP.  Thats the good news, see bad news below.

There are several additional DECUS submissions that are not in the index
shown on the "www/lib10" index.html page.  If you increment the octal
number on the end you can find "/0407/" through "/0553".  There is some
other good stuff in there (thanks team Shoppa!) like pascal compilers,
basic compilers, teco10, forum, focal, xtec, etc.  Worth just nosing around.

Now bad news:

Evidently the submission came from a site that had a KA-10 box.

Unfortunately this EXE has been "hand patched" by the contributor to replace 
all the KL-10 instructions with "site defined" MUUO's.  In order to get it to
run I had to locate all the "site defined" MUUO's, infer what the original
KL-10 instruction was, and put things back where they should have been.  

Anyway thats how I got mine to work.  I am still chasing a couple of issues.

My current EXE runs mostly ok on simh -10 b6 and the ts10 update from 2 days
ago that fixes the floating instructions.

Harris may have a 2.0 image and sources (grrr).

I am uneasy about all this hand patching and unpatching - but if no better
image of the game can be found (and more importantly made available) I will
post a .tap file with a backup saveset of what I've hacked up.

Eventually I'd like to get all the decus stuff onto a virtual disk and burn
the virtual disk onto a cd.  It would be nice to have a way of letting a ts10
virtual disk "attach" onto simh -10 and vice versa.  Then we could just
"attach" the cdrom file to our simulator of choice.

THE WAR IS OVER!!
[DECWAR high segment removed from swapper]
The Klingon Empire is VICTORIOUS!!
The Empire salutes you.  Begin slave operations immediately.

Here is a copy of Decwar v2.2.  Have fun.  Beware that I got a copy of this
EXE file from the archives on Tim Shoppa's site so I had to do the following
things to make it work:

  1.  Convert DECWAR.EXE from 32 bit file format to 36 bit file format

  2.  The original submitter evidently had a KA-10 system, and hand
      patched all the non-KA-10 instructions to be site defined MUUO's.
      I suppose they hacked their monitor to emulate the non-KA-10 
      instructions.  I had to locate all the site defined MUUO's in
      the image, infer what the original non-KA-10 instruction was,
      and hand patch it back to what I think it might have been
      originally :-)

  3.  Un-hack ddt trap so we can ddt and run the game 

In order to snarf this version of DECWAR please do the following (I am
assuming you are on a Unix system!):

% telnet netcom.com 3000 > decwar.tap.uu
% uudecode decwar.tap.uu
% gunzip decwar.tap.gz

(I apologize for the rude file transfer technique - it isn't as nice as
ftpd or httpd but I may not need to worry about globs and eggs or eggs 
and globs these days - wink wink nudge nudge say no more!)

The file decwar.tap is now a file which you can 'attach' to the tape drive
of your favorite emulator.  It is written in backup interchange format and
contains the following files:

	DECWAR.EXE  DECWAR.HLP  DECWAR.GRP  DECWAR.NWS

| .r credir
| Create directory: GAM:
| Create directory: ^C
| .r setsrc
| *cp [5,30]
| *^C
| .r backup
| /tape mta0
| /inter
| /files
| /prot 155
| /restore dskb:[5,30]*.*=mta0:*.*
| /exit
| .

I advise restoring the files into dskb:[5,30]  (GAM:).  Decwar has code
to delete itself if it thinks it is not being run from GAM: so if you
want to copy it someplace else keep another copy!

I am very happy to have this experience back and more pleased to be able
to share it with all those who have an interest.  If anyone finds a copy
of the v2.3 EXE file or the DECWAR F4 source code (and more importantly is
willing to share) please get in touch with me.

Now to attack 7.04

Later!

An updated copy of the decwar save-set has been put up - this copy has the
help command fixed and the exe file has been re-saved as a shared segement.

>% telnet netcom.com 3000 > decwar.tap.uu
>% uudecode decwar.tap.uu
>% gunzip decwar.tap.gz

If you've already got the exe you can filddt the fix in like so:

|.r filddt
|File: gam:decwar.exe/p
|455044/     dmove 1,0(5)
|455045/     dmovem 1,3524
|^Z

I had the sense of the moves wrong.  After patching the exe you may need to:

|.get gam:decwar
|.ssave gam:decwar

This should do the trick.

Daniel,
I got mine a long time ago, while at college.  My freebsd version is nearing
completion, and should be done within weeks.  It has a Tops-20 interface (thanks
to Columbia University's CCMD package), and will support 1024 users (I hope...).
I am concerned about the overhead of all the computer controled devices, but
I haven't written those guys yet, and have ideas on how to minimize them (only
visible items will be "alive".
The feel of my game is a little different than decwar, since it had a command 
line input, and mine is parsed like tops-20.  I am thinking of adding a 
compatibility mode for decwar.  

BTW=> my game is to be called Decwar 2020 (guess why).

More to come...
-HN
