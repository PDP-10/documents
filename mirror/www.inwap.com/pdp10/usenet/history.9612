The actual name of that color is Terracotta, and I regret my part in the

I just got back from DECUS in Anaheim with a little PDP-10 story to
relate.  The keynote speakers the first day were Bob Palmer and Bill
Gates.  Bill told a little story about his history with Digital.  His
first experience was in 8th grade, getting time on a local PDP-10 in
Seattle.  (They got free time in exchange for finding bugs in TOPS-10. 
Needless to say, they had all the free time they needed.)  Soon after
that, he and Paul Allen wrote their first BASIC interpreter using macros
in MACRO-10 to interpret BASIC statements.

After all the other shameless commercial hype was over, Bob Palmer and
Digital presented Bill with his own personal PDP-10 to put in his new
house: a MicroVax-II sized box with the DECsystem-10 logo, and a KL
front switch panel (which we all know is really a PDP-11 switch panel,
but at least the right color).  Inside the box was an Alpha running the
PDP-10 simulator running TOPS-10.  Bill tried hard and finally
remembered his project-programmer number (even remembered the term!). 
Unfortunately at this point, the emulator wasn't working right, and
system "MRBILL" never let him log in.
Anyway, it was pretty cool, and DECUS made a good audience for this kind
of thing.

Last slide was a bar chart comparing system performance of the KA10,
KI10, KL10, and "Alpha10".  The last one was about 100 times the
performance of the KL (claimed, not audited).

The company was Computer Center Corp.  They were undercapitalized
and didn't have the money to pay for the machine.  They used the
large number of open bug reports (SPRs) as an excuse not to pay
for the machine.  The deal was free time in exchange for crashing
the system on the condition that each crash was to be documented
and not tried again until CCC told the high school crackers that
DEC had fixed that particular bug.

Digital also offered 'the Giant Bryant,' up to 104 MByte on disks
about 3' in diameter (which is often mentioned in this Newsgroup).
The project to ship RA10 controllers with RB10 disks was started
6 months before my RP10 controller with RP10 disks; also the
RA10 designer was 10 years out of school when I was fresh out.
CCC was the only Digital customer for RB10s, having ordered two,
taken delivery on one, before they went belly up. Steve (Slug)
Russell who was at CCC at the time later told me the only reason
they bought the RB10s rather than RP02s is because they thought
that with the project engineer having 10 years experience and a
six month head start they would be the only PDP-10 timesharing
utility with mass storage for some number of months. CCC was
correct. The total number of RA10s and RB10s shipped were one
each; the total number of RP10s and RP02s shipped were 300 and
1,500 respectively.

    I could believe it.  Of course, they'd have to be running teco on 110
    baud Teletypes and using programs like pip, dir, etc that only needed
    a Kword or so.

I was assuming they were comparing the native speed of the Alpha, rather
than the speed after emulation, and I was also assuming a Stanford mid-80s
style of user - 9600bps terminals (on terminal servers) running EMACS and MM
and pascal compiles and such.  Stanford ran their machines into the ground
with up to 100 or so users on each machine, but I figured "50 users"
was a fair estimate of "pleasant" loading...

I guess it might be a little difficult putting 10 100Mbps ethernets in
the alpha, not to mention finding 100Mbps "terminal servers"...

(I suspect one thing there IS 100 time more of is memory.  A 4Mword KL10 had
about 20Mbytes, and 2Gbytes of memory isn't all that unusual these days...)

And no SMP.  I still have Jim's slides that illustrate that adding a CPU
in master/slave software architecture resulted in 1 KL + 1 KL = 1.8 KLs. 
Running SMP software architecture resulted in 1KL + 1KL = 2 KLs - a teensy
bit for the few boot CPU tasks.  I don't remember how may jobs the monitor
on the quad-CPU system in Oakridge was built for, but they ran at max and
were very pleased with the response time; I want to say 500 jobs but it
could have been a little as 200 jobs.  And I will point out that this was
on a timesharing system--not a partition-type system.  I am finding that
there is great confusion over definitions of timesharing, operating
system, etc.

I was the "lucky" person on stage with Gates and Palmer and I still
don't know what went wrong with the LAT connect. After all the time
I and others had spend getting this event put together, it was quite
disappointing that it didn't work. Although, from reading the account
here and hearing others, it came off pretty well. 

The "system" was an LN03 printer cab painted the real blaize(?) blue
and the DECSYSTEM-10 logo was made from real photos. The 11-panel
was from a real KL (in MR02 lobby) and small circuit board was
added to drive the lights. Inside was a 266Mhz Alpha running 
Digital Unix and Ken Harrenstien's emulator. Eric Williams got
the "box" made and I set up the emulator and TOPS-10 system. 
What was supposed to happen (and what had worked perfectly all along
and even earlier that morning) was Gates was supposed to connect
to the TOPS-10 system from the laptop running PATHWORKS LAT under
Win95. Like I said before, I don't know what went wrong, and probably
never will know.

larry

The Alpha-10 slide wasn't quite right... 8^) It's my educated
guess that the "system" was about 1.X times a KL, where X is between
2 and 5. I'm supposed to be getting a 500Mhz Alpha soon, and I'm
anxious to take the emulator out for a spin on it.

[Hey! Larry!]  It's nice to hear that TOPS10 still lives and even
maintains its cantankerousness even when being emulated.  Whenever Jim and
Tony worked on something they were real proud of, they would come and get
me to admire their latest and greatest.  Inevitably, the system would
crash, the hardware would go boiinnggg or something would happen.  Then
they would chase me away, work on the problems, fix them, and come get me
again--usually about 6 hours later.  They really enjoyed those debugging
sessions.

I've worked on Unix now for longer than I worked on PDP-10s (people
have gotten inured to me muttering about TOPS-10 doing this or that
better).  It's a living, even a pretty enjoyable one, especially when
Alliant Computer was a healthy company (half the OS group had lots of
-10 experience, even ITS!)  I don't have time to pursue Linux issues
(surprising what a wife and a 6-year old expect out of an old hacker),
but I think we should support Linux loudly.

One of the things that really helped DEC was that we shipped TOPS-10
source, this let us hire some very good people who were instantly
productive.  We also sold PDP-10s at an educational discounts, so we
had a steady stream of young, skilled and enthusiastic monitor
programmers to hire.

Trying to hire people for Digital Unix development has been remarkably
frustrating.  A lot of college grads seem to learn C++ under windows and
have next to no idea what debugging a kernel race condition is all about.
I'm looking forward to seeing resumes with Linux experience.

It seems to me that Linux not only will help Unix vendors hire talented
folks without raiding other vendors, but also offers a chance to
implement some TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 features in Unix.  For example, I've
always have been fond of the I/O buffer structure of TOPS-10 I/O.  It
provided a means to do read ahead for all devices (Unix readahead is
generally a per-device or per-file system design).  I've long
thought it would be fun to get that into Unix and stdio, but I can't
justify doing that here.  And even if I did, what could I do with the
code?  (Actually, we and other Unix vendors are beginning to do Direct I/O
for transferring large files with little overhead and bypassing the cache,
so there might actually *be* something I could do with it!)

Doing that in Linux would be easier (all our high performance code makes
almost anything harder to do than in FreeBSD or Linux), and easily
sharable, and possibly even worthwhile.  For example, TOPS-10's buffered
I/O would be ideal for something like a MPEG viewer.

So, how about it?  What else to people miss most about PDP-10 OS design
that would be worth writing to a demo-level in Linux?

Also not true of TOPS-20. If you are refering to file 'generations' then
foo.bar;1 and foo.bar;2 are seperate files entirely. The OS just makes it easy
to create successive generations. It is by no means required. The previous
generations can also be deleted and expunged while the new generation is open.

The default behavior is to keep old generations (as deleted) even after the
new generation is closed.

There is no file system, to my knowledge that even approches the capabilities 
of Tops-20 CFS in a cluster. Maybe in about 5 years NT will catch up to
Tops-20 6.0 circa 1984 (I would not bet on it though).

IMO - Tops-20 was the best operating system in 4 areas:

	1. File system
	2. Paging (really 1 and 2 are the same thing - on T-20 that 
		is the beauty)
	3. Software interrupt system (Unix has tried to get this right 
		at least twice with no success)
	4. Processes paradigm (if other OSs used processes like T-20
		then threads would never have been invented)

Many people liked the COMND% JSYS but that was really a user program and is
available for unix today. Same goes for the EXEC - it was really just a user
program and had nothing to do with the OS. I never really loved the EXEC anyway
and used replaced the EXEC with Emacs as my 'shell'.

Tops-20 had 4 big problem areas also:

	1. Not portable (if only we had rewritten it in PASCAL or 
		something - sigh - believe me C was not a possibility)
	2. Limited directory structure. (easy to fix)
	3. device specificity (no good pipes - PTYs do not count)
	4. Limited software interrupt system (the best I have seen but it 
		could have been better - also easy to fix).

Since we are on the subject of good/bad OS features the worst features of 
Unix are:

	1. Written in one of the suckiest languages of all time (C)
	2. Software interrupts do not work.
	3. Scheduler is a joke (and they are SO proud of it)
	4. Threads (even some of the plan 9 developers say that if
		processes on Unix worked better then they would never
		have done threads)
	5. Streams - what a horrible, evil, nasty, slow, heavyweight
		way to do something that should be simple, pure and 
		beautiful. Streams alone should deter anyone from using
		unix. Again - they are SO PROUD OF IT - gag.

OTOH - Pipes (and the pipe paradigm) are pretty cool.

NT is just a bunch of ripped off ideas running on a PC. Plug and Play is
a nice idea though. So are DLLs but Tops-20 had those in the works when the
plug got pulled.

DOS and Windows do not count as Operating systems.

I believe that if Tops-20 had been ported to a different architecture then
we would not be using Unix or NT today.

The TOPS-20 TCP implementation we used (BBN?) did something like this.

Basically, the problem is all the possible options, like is your
/dev/tcp/25 example a server or client open? Right there it begins to
go down the rathole.

Put another way, there's been absolutely nothing stopping someone from
putting together a library which implements the above sort of
thing. As I remember people have tried from time to time these past 15
or thereabouts years and it always went down a rathole, but I wouldn't
discourage someone from trying again (well, maybe I just did, a
little, but hey.)

Anyone remember the TOPS-20 TCP I'm referring to well enough to
generate a reasonably common but hairy example? I remember you'd often
put things like timeout values into the "filename" string. In the end
it becomes just a sort of interpreter that happened to pass through
the OPEN call, but really didn't have a lot to do with the file
system, it may as well have been lisp code (hey there you go,

 open("/dev/lisp/(connect (socket :TCP) ((getservbyname "telnet") :port))",
	O_RDWR);

 :-)

And, this is something that can get into UNIX or NT to a degree,
without breaking stuff.  The big problem with UNIX is that you can't
change it too much or people scream and yell and programs break.  I
remember when shared libraries were considered just a silly thing Sun
was doing and ran into people that were strongly opposed to them.
But a file system could change and not break too much; except of course
if the semantics change to be non-POSIX...  A big reason to have a new
OS; NT could be it, but they've got their own baggage.

>	2. Paging (really 1 and 2 are the same thing - on T-20 that 
>		is the beauty)

Yep.  It had the hardware too.  Much of the problems with UNIX
paging come from it being designed on computers with some missing
features (VAXen had a lot of VM support in hardware, but oddly no
LRU, which if present would have eliminated the need for the clock
algorithm). 

>	3. Software interrupt system (Unix has tried to get this right 
>		at least twice with no success)

I never liked this either, and I'm a big UNIX fan.  (am I the only
UNIX fan that even sees UNIX flaws?)  VMS's AST system was so much
cleaner and easier to work with; NT has this, but in a limited
form with caveats in the docs (I'd much rather use an AST than
wait on an event).  And the UNIX signal rules aren't too constant
(at least if you want portability with older non-POSIX) as well
as being somewhat byzantine at times.  

>	4. Processes paradigm (if other OSs used processes like T-20
>		then threads would never have been invented)

Hmm, I always liked these, because they seemd *fast*.  But that
was relative, because I could compare them to VMS processes which
were dog slow.  With UNIX  you could have 1 process per command,
but with VMS they had to be shared (a UNIX style shell from
DEC had to save processes and reuse them as well, as the fork/exec
style was too slow).

On the other hand, the Amiga had nice tasks/processes.  They were
essentially threads, but that term wasn't in vogue like it is now.
Theoretically, "threads" can all be done from the user level, it
needn't be the kernel's concern (heretical I know, marketting people
will be upset at me).  If they're done at the kernel level, then VM
and processes should be divorced (ie, you turn a thread into a
processes by giving it a new address space).  Fork() naturally fits
with the thread paradigm, and that's what fork() should create.
Of course, UNIX baggage says this will never happen in UNIX.

>	4. Threads (even some of the plan 9 developers say that if
>		processes on Unix worked better then they would never
>		have done threads)

Actually, I don't personally put threads into the UNIX category, since
they're non standard (ie, they may be in a standard, but each UNIX
system I use does threads differently, making them impractical to
use).

This was System V.  Berkeley people thought streams sucked too.
Here on the west coast, streams aren't considered UNIX, they're
just a vendor enhancement that didn't work out.  You don't blame
all of UNIX for something Sun or HP added that didn't work out,
so don't blame all of UNIX for an ATT feature.

"Plug and Play" and "DLL's" are old ideas, and commonly implemented
ideas.  Windows didn't even make them popular, they already were
popular!  Just use their real names - auto configuring devices and
shared library modules - and you'll find lots of other systems that
have them.  Even in the PC world, these were big on Macs and Amigas
when Windows was just learning to boot.

True.  Heck, at the very least, it should have been ported to the VAX!
DEC didn't understand this, even they had several OS's for the PDP-11,
they were still reluctant to separate the OS from the machine.

Tops-20 did not use a brain dead LRU algorithm. It used Peter
Denning's working sets, which are vastly superior to LRU.

It is true that working sets requires a tiny bit of hardware support,
specifically you have to be able to set an "in use" bit for the page 
after you've calculated the effective address. You already know the
page, all you need is either a bit in the page table, or a bit vector
somewhere else.

The Vaxen folks were too stuck with NIH syndrome to look at the work
that was completed just 15 miles away. And those folks brought us
VMS.2, aka NT.

It is great to see elsewhere in this thread the comment that if Unix
and NT had done processes half as well as Tops-20, we wouldn't have
to deal with threads and all the half assed implementations of
threads. When I tell people that Tops-20 had processes that let the
programmer be protected from inappropriate memory corruption but also
allowed the direct and simple sharing of data, they look at me like I
have two heads. Sigh.

I doubt if this is a great idea. After years as a '10 and '20
operating systems programmer, I moved on to other areas of software.
Then in 1991, I took up grad school at George Mason University. I was
planning on "testing out" of the required CS571 Operating Systems
class until they hired Peter Denning as CS department head. Since his
PhD thesis was the foundation for the beloved "working set" model used
by Tops-20, I decided to actually take the course from him.

Professor Denning was recognized as an expert on Operating Systems. He
wrote a text book on the topic in the early 80s. He did not use his
own book in the course. He said it was not sufficiently current to be
interesting. He assigned Goscinski's "Distributed Operating Systems,
the Logical Design" for the class. But he didn't use it much. He had
us real and analyze the classic papers on operating systems from
Djisktra, C.A.R. Hoare, etc.

    As for Tom's comments about PASCAL being the language of choice for
    TOPS-20 implementation we should rememeber that he also thinks Fortran
    is the best programming language invented by mankind.:-)

PASCAL as a systems programming language for PDP-10s suffered from many
of the same problems that C did.  The main one being a penchant for running
on byte oriented machines.  Of course, pascal would let you do evil things
in compiler-provided functions that it wouldn't permit mere programmers
to do in THEIR pascal programs (the most obvious being a variable number
of arguments.)  I did a little bit of work on the rutgers/etc pascal
compiler, and it was pretty gross inside...

Inadequacies in the languages or their implementations didn't stop many
useful systems programs from being written in either pascal or C, and you
could do some amazing things with little pieces of assembly language code
tied in (in particular, Greg Satz and I once teamed up to do a tops-10
split-screen "talk" programs (ala ITS?) in about 1980.  Greg wrote pascal
code that did most of the work, and I wrote a tiny little piece of macro to
allow to pascal jobs to talk to each other through the shareable highseg.
(ok, amateurish stuff...))


    IMHO PDP10 assembler (regardless of MACRO, MIDAS, or the one pass
    assembler whose name I forget) was the best language I ever used.

(FAIL.) They were pretty nice.  Beautiful as assemblers go, backed up by an
elegant architecture with sufficient complexity to make it fun.  (compared
to a PDP-11, which was only elegant in a minimalist sort of way.)

Sigh.

Hey guys, when I started this thread I hoped to get some ideas for
Linux development suggested and bandied about.

I was afraid it would go off in some rathole.

Reread the subject line.  Reread the Newsgroups line.  Let's take the language
holy war somewhere appropriate - Linux will not be recoded in Pascal,
Modula, Simula, or BLISS.

The MACRO-10 notes have possiblilities.  One of the great uses for its
macros were to created large, complex, interconnected data structures at
compile time.  (Once as a hack I wrote macros that took a like of
command names and created a search tree.  Those macros and about
10 instructions converted a command name to a pointer to a dispatch
table entry for the command.)  The macro expansion was immense, pretty
much as I expected, and I stuck with the command decoding in the TULIP
I/O package, pretty much as I expected.  (Tulip is in DECUS and in FTP
archives - it used the User UUOs to make an extremely nice I/O package.
Its lexical analyzer used a macros to good result to generate meta code
that drove analysis.)

I haven't thought too much about what a CPP with MACRO-10 style
macros might look like, but I was thinking the other day it would
be nice to take something like a getopt() control string and use that
to generate the appropriate C code.  It would be pretty easy to write
a MACRO-10 macro to accept extra coloration to generate code for
options that take decimal numbers, strings, or even whatnot.

Has any one tried writing yacc code for MACRO-10 macros?

Professor Per Brinch Hansen designed a language called "concurrent pascal",
where he added the necessary semantics, and also constructed a complete
operating system and development system for the PDP-11/45, the same machine
unix was running on, and I think at approximately the same time.

But the compiler was an academic completely non-optimizing 7-pass compiler
generating code for a virtual machine that was interpreted.

The name of the operating system was SOLO. I think the design can be
considered quite modern compared to the more kludgy UNIX. Maybe he
was just ahead of his time. In those days operating systems should consist
of a monolithic kernel.

Subsequently, he revised the language and ported to the IBM PC, resulting
in the "Edison" language and operating system.  It was ummm primitive, but
oh so simple.  It was along the lines of a Modula subset.  Perhaps its most
major drawback was the lack of inter-module typechecking, which was quite
enough to drive some of us bonkers.

The key feature to the language was that each module was a critical
section, and that mutual exclusion was _completely_ hidden from the
programmer.  No locking bugs at all.  

Sigh.  Oh for the next generation of true system programming
languages... but it will only happen after the current wave of OO silliness
passes.

Thanks for the reminder... I used to work at a company which did
application software for a system they had implemented, based on the
Per Brinch Hansen book, on a set of pdp-11s.  This was back in the
mid- to late-70s timeframe.

For obvious reasons, we have a lot of Stanford additions to Tops-20 in our
implementation at XKL, one of which is the PIP: device (which I think was
re-worked from the Utah code, but not exactly the same).  Dick Helliwell has
improved it to the point that the GNU utilities he's ported work right when

It only went into a rathole because someone who is versed in only one OS
decided to resurrect the old OS wars we had in those days.  I have been
horrified at some of the assessments being made.   One of the reasons that
MACRO-10 was used was because one didn't find himself wrestling with
compiler bugs in trying to debug a piece of hardware/software.  Jim would
come home with yet another gray hair just because he got fucked by a
compiler bug after spending days trying to figure out why his software
didn't work the way he wanted it to work.  So picking an appropriate
language is very important with respect to the stability of the
assembler/compiler.  Tony actually took pity on Eric and installed a
permanent patch in the TOPS10 monitor rather than force a fix in the BLISS
compiler to fix a bug discovered in Fortran.  

Another consideration of picking your tools is build procedures.  Is it
going to take days to do a build of the monitor?  These people who think
that BLISS is so great, never had to wrangle with any of the packaging
issues involved when BLISS was used; they didn't care, they didn't hear;
as long as they could write code very fast, the consequences of their
choice of implementations was completely ignored.

There!  One of my flames of my chest.  B.T.W.  If I had a nickel for every
swear I uttered in dealing with all the BLISSes, I would be richer than
B.Gates.

Just for completeness, remember that Multics (the mother of most of
the "modern" operatings sytems) is written in PL/I (beginning mid-60's).
The later work by ANSI Committee X3J1 included a Technical Report
(not quite a Standard) for real-time extensions to the various PL/I
standards.  As one who worked on this project, I continue to be amazed
at how clean the design is and how powerful, yet efficient to implement
it is.

BTW I developed the PL/I for the PDP-11. :)

EDITORIAL:
It is unfortunate how much of the prior art in our profession is "lost"
and how much effort is wasted by each new generation of programmers as
they repeat our mistakes on a larger scale but with more hype.  Anyone
dabbling in operating systems should have a thorough understanding of
Multics and its immediate successors (e.g. VMS).  A later child, UNIX, 
is the result of its authors not really understanding the many lessons 
previously learned, with many "fixes" having to be applied later.  Most 
of the PC systems are much worse designs.

There's this great videotaped talk by Alan Kay from about 10 years ago
in which he shows taped demos of the great old programs, like Sketchpad
and Engelbart's system at SRI whose name I've forgotten, and the early
Smalltalk work on the Alto, and he says "People ask me why I keep
giving the same talk over and over.  I'll stop when I can buy software
as good as this."  We aren't there yet.

As I recall, at the high water mark we (ADP Network Services) were running 
something like 80 KS-10s. These were pretty evenly split between ADP/Onsites 
running at client sites and those we ran for the client in our data center in 
Ann Arbor.

TOPS-10 certainly ran on the KS-10. How do I know? I did the portation 
myself over the winter '77-'78 at DEC's Marlboro plant (even though I was an 
ADP employee at the time). ADP's operating system WAS TOPS-10, the BASIC look 
and feel was provided by a user interface (today we'd call it a shell) called 
CL (Command Language) written by Cyphernetics before they were acquired by 
ADP. Users with high enough privileges could exit CL and get to the TOPS-10 
command interpreter.

To answer some questions posed in other postings, the DECsystem-2020 (based 
on the KS-10 processor) was introduced in 1978, at just about the same time 
as the first VAX. The systems sold directly by DEC mostly ran TOPS-20. I'm 
not sure if DEC ever directly sold any TOPS-10 machines, although all the 
ones OEMed to ADP ran TOPS-10.

According to Computer Engineering (Bell/Mudge/Mc.Namara) 1978 - it is
mentioned in the 36-bit section in passing as it appeared the year that the
book was published.

The design goal of the machine is interesting: to produce a machine with the
power of a PDP-6.

As the first 36-bitter to be planned and built based on solid-state memory,
(the book indicates that at least the initial KL-10s were core-based)  this
seems to have been a big example of missed opportunity.

While CPU speed kept increasing, the first departure from the concepts which
make big iron good came with the KL and the decision to design the machine
with the fastest-available logic *and* eliminate the advantages by replacing
transistors with microcode.

With fast 1K solid state memory in hand, eliminating the major bottleneck in
core machines (I believe even the slowest ran at least 2x faster than the
fastest core), the new technology was placed into a slower machine, again
designed to save transistors.

The approach did not work in 1967 for the PDP-8s. It did not work again a
decade later.

KS10 was the designation for the CPU itself (just like KA10, KE10 and
other option names) (trivia question, what was the KE10 option on the 
KA10 CPU?) PDP-10 systems had system designations which are not the 
same thing as the option name for a given CPU (or other) option.

I saw a number of sites where they had a 2020 as a crash and burn machine

OK, what is it? K indicates it's a processor option. My first guess was that
it was 16 words of solid-state memory, the accumulator upgrade, but the PDP-10
Refernce Handbook 2nd ed. designates that one KM10. And KT10 was the memory
protection for timesharing upgrade (now did DEC really ever sell a KA
*without* those two options?) which leaves the hardware for dual-CPU
configuration as the only other K upgrade I can think of.

You're right.  The CPU is a KS-10.  The system is a DECSYSTEM-2020,
often referred to as KS-2020.

The second 20 in 2020 is from the design goal of having a CPU that is
20% of the speed of a KL-1090, but much cheaper.

When we had a KA-10, KL-10, and KS-10 all in the same room, we found that
the KL was 6 times faster than the KA and 5 times faster than the KS.

>What is TYMCOM-X like?  Any copies floating around?

It's gone.  The last Tymshare machine was shut down in March.
It was derived from TOPS-10 5.02, had paging like TOPS-20, and a
DMA interface to the Tymnet network.

A quick history lesson. When DEC first introduced the PDP-10, marketing 
called it the DECsystem-10. There was to be a series of machines from the 
DECsystem-1010 to the -1050. The -1010 was to be a single user 
non-timesharing system. One of Tony Wachs' first jobs at DEC was writing the 
-1010 single user monitor. If memory serves me correctly the -1010, -1020, 
and -1030 never saw the light of day; but the -1040 and -1050 were sold. 

When DEC introduced the first paging -10, we needed a way to distinguish 
between the non-paging and paging processors in the monitor sources. We used 
the processor part number from the prints in our conditional assembly 
statements; IFN FTKA10, and IFN FTKI10; and began to refer to them as such. 
Since every installation received monitor sources, this quickly became the 
names by which they were known.

The next generation -10 was the one with cached memory. The engineering team 
(lead by John Leng, I seem to recall) wanted their own separate identity. 
Even though what came to be known as the DECsystem-20 began as another 
DECsystem-10, the acquisition of the TENEX operating system (along with Dan 
Murphy) from BBN, and its metamorphosis through the VIROS and SNARK stages, 
foretold the emergence of what was being touted as a new product line. The 
engineers who designed and built the thing just thought they were building 
the next generation PDP-10, hence the designation KL10.

There was actually a turf battle within DEC about whether or not TOPS-10 (as 
the PDP-10 monitor was renamed by David Stone) would ever be ported to the 
KL. Eventually sane heads prevailed.

By the time the "small -10" was being spec'ed, the designation Kx10 for 36 
bit processors was firmly established. Again, it was viewed as strictly a 
DECsystem-20, hence the 2020 designator. By this time I had left DEC and was 
working for ADP. When we were pitched the -2020 as a possible remote 
computing engine, only TOPS-20 was mentioned. It was clear that DEC only 
intended to sell it as an "orange box". We (ADP) said, "Oh yes that's all 
very nice, and we'd really like to order a hundred or so, but we're a TOPS-10 
shop."

"No worries!" says DEC. "We'll get TOPS-10 running on it in no time." Months 
later DEC is still saying "no worries" to ADP's management, while my former 
comrades in the monitor group are telling me privately that nothing's 
happening. At this point I get ADP's management to sit down with DEC's 
marketing folk and point out that since DEC doesn't seem interested in 
getting TOPS-10 up on the 2020, why not let me do it? So I get issued a 
contractors badge and move back in a couple of stalls over from my old 
office in MR-1. Since the TOPS-10/TOPS-20 war was still going on, and I was 
firmly allied with the TOPS-10 folk, I never referred to the "small -10" as 
anything other than the KS10, either verbally or in the sources or 
documentation.

So, bottom line. The DECsystem-2020 was based on the KS10 processor. I don't 
believe it was ever sold as a "DECsystem-10", even when it ran TOPS-10. It 
was certainly never called a KS-2020.

Note that the above is all only the way I remember it. I wrote my last line 
of code for the KS10 over eighteen years ago. Things could be a little fuzzy. 
I should point out that DEC did eventually assign someone to the project, 
Doug Detroy. I recall he wrote the LP20 device driver, and perhaps some other 
stuff.

   This, of course, assumes that the KL's cache is turned on. I
remember when I was at ADPNS I ran an experiment using the various
timing diags. Unfortunately, I left the printouts with ADP when I
left their employ but the diags indicated that the KL without its
cache was _slower_ than a KA!

   What is it that they say about age and treachery?

Sorry, but you're wrong.  "DECsystem-blah" didn't enter the lexicon
until very late 1968 (if not 1969).  The PDP-10 was introduced in
mid-1967; first ship was late 1967.  We called it a PDP-10 (or just "10").

John, which hindsight-historian told you this stuff?
Through 1968, the nomenclature (sales literature, manuals,
chat, listings,etc.) was PDP-10/40 and PDP-10/50.

From another post ...
Wasn't the KE-10 the "extended instructions" option (byte manipulation)?
Without the option, they trapped and were emulated in the monitor.

The systems that were delivered to Cyphernetics (later ADP) in mid
1969 still said PDP-10 on the front.  I don't remember seeing anything
that said DECsystem until the KI was announced.

All the glossy brochures described at least a 10/20 and a 10/30 (I
feel less certain about the 10/10, although I think I remember those
too).  The smaller versions were missing various options, like disks,
and seemed intended for single user and process control type uses.  I
have no idea whether any ever were sold.

Thank you ... very much.  All of that "DECsystem" chit-chat has
bugged me, reading all these "war stories" (which, like in `real life',
tend to be told the loudest by those who never really "fought").

I *knew* the word didn't exist through Nov, 1968, when I left DEC;
and, though I switched from PDP-10 marketing grunt to hacker then,
I stopped paying attention to what "they" called it.  (I just enjoyed
hacking on it.)

I didn't mean the (above) "PDP-10/40 and PDP-10/50" to be exclusive;
just that those were the two models that we commonly shipped.
Also, as I racked my brain trying to remember the distinguishing
characteristics of the 10/20 & 10/30, I blanked; I do believe
John was correct that the 10/10 was (supposed to be) a single-user
system (no prot/rel regs).  I don't believe any 10/10s ever shipped --
given that the option (KT-10 ??) was < $10K, and even a minimal
KA-10 + (1) MB-10 was > $130K, it looks like a lose.

  Gratuitous anecdote:

    During 1968, it was fairly common for a customer to visit
    Maynard while their system was going through manufacturing
    and final check-out.  A doctor from Max Planck Institute,
    in Germany, was in for a visit, and I took him out to the
    floor to see, and actually use, his machine.  It wasn't yet
    ready for anything "serious", so I fired up ELIZA [ (WORKER) HELLO ]
    and sat him down at the KSR-35 :

      10:  HOW DO YOU DO.  PLEASE STATE YOUR PROBLEM.

    Cust:  I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.

      10:  IS IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS THAT YOU CAME TO ME?

    [ We all cracked up. ]

You're all wrong.  I began working at DEC July 12, 1971 in the group
called Tape Prep.  I became head of the RUNOFF group in that organization
in '72.  That was when we had to go through all of our DECtapes and change
PDP-10 to DECSYSTEM-10.  Later we had to go back and change DECSYSTEM-10
to DECsytem10 because of a trademark infringement lawsuit brought against
us by Singer sewing machine company; I can never rememer which way it
was--with/out the dashes and I seem to remember that the capitalization
was pretty important, too.

Most of the specs in the Notebook set were typed in RUNOFF.  Tape Prep
kept these specs on DECtape.  There was a set of DECtapes that had the
latest edit on them and a set of DECtapes that had the previous edit on
them.  Some of you "old" guys should talk about the black tapes.

One day the fire alarm rang.  This was in the mill which had been
saturated with lanolin in the days when it processed wool.  We always were
concerned about having a real fire and how fast the mill would go up in
smoke with all that oil in the wood.  Anyway, this was a real alarm (not a
planned fire drill);  I looked at those 50 tapes and decided that I really
didn't want to have to type them all in again, dumped my garbage can, and
put all the tapes in the can and carried it out the building with me. 
What didn't fit in the can, I put on my arms.  DECtapes were really the
best kind of media because I could "store" 10 on each arm like bracelets.

 I was criticized of making a spectacle of myself in front of KO (our
offices were next door to each other).  Later there came a little edict
down from on high about what we were doing about off-site preservation of
our bits.

I'm glad that /BAH spoke up, as my history with these beasts starts with a -20.

I have in my position a 1971 average-phonebook-sized document with the title

        [d] [i] [g] [i] [t] [a] [l]
                   pdp10
                 reference
                  handbook

on the spine, with the year 1971 at the bottom.  (The front cover, and a couple
of pages like the title page, are missing.)  Chapter 1 of Book 3, "Communica-
ting with the Monitor: TOPS-10 Monitor Manual", starts with the text

	The PDP-10 Timesharing System allows many independent user programs
	to share the facilities of a single PDP-10 computer.

My 1972 _decsystem10 users handbook_ still has "pdp10" on the title pages of
several sections.

A manual (or section) that I can't locate right now had a description of all 5
monitor variants, 10/10 through 10/50, in terms of minimum core needed and the
like.  I'll try to find that later.

Ok, since we're in session for history lessons.

I used to work at the University of Oslo in Norway. They purchased a
single-CPU DECsystem-10/KL10 i 1976, and upgraded to a dual KL10 SMP system in
1978. 

I seem to recall that the name used for the SMP configuration was
DECsystem-1077. Why? How many other configurations were there?

Also: It was not until after the demise of our DEC-10 ('87-ish) that I started
hearing of tri-SMP systems. How many were there of these beasts? When did they
start making them?

Grumble.  I can't seem to remember dates today.  The first TOPS10 monitor
that we shipped that supported SMP was called version 7.01.  I don't
remember our first ship date, but I don't think it was in 1978 (1980 comes
to mind but this damnable disease is affecting my recall at the moment).  

<I seem to recall that the name used for the SMP configuration was
<DECsystem-1077. Why? How many other configurations were there?

SMP is our shorthand way for Symmetric Mulit-Processing.  It was the
software design that Jim and Tony developed for TOPS10 when Jim discovered
that the current scheme of master/slave of a dual processor system really
wasn't very efficient; his DECUS slides always said that one KL + one KL =
1.8.  After implementing SMP, it became one KL + one KL = 2 minus a teensy
tiny bit because of the boot CPU tasks.  

<Also: It was not until after the demise of our DEC-10 ('87-ish) that I
started
<hearing of tri-SMP systems. How many were there of these beasts? When did
<they start making them?

Tri-SMP became a product that we supported.  It just meant that if a
customer hooked up yet another CPU to his system, there were none of those
infinitely complicated support issues that marketing seemed to get us in
trouble.  Just as a note to those of you who weren't privy to the inside
poop.  There was no coding changes involved to announce Tri-SMP.  We had
designed the 7.01 ship so that the only changes required to support
Tri-SMP was the generation of the SPD and an edit of exactly two words in
the beware file from dual to multi.  It took Jim 9 months of frustration
to get this done and available to our customers.  I believe that that was
when certain groups of people became labelled with the term
"product-prevention".

I have a poster that is the configuration of one of our customers.  They
bought a lot of hardware; so, when they wanted to put 5 CPUs together to
run TOPS10, marketing ignored the support issue.  Just as a side note, the
limitation of the number of CPUs supported was memory.  This 5-CPU system
used Ampax (sp?) memory which allowed all CPUs to port into each box.  DEC
did not manufacture memory (they had cancelled the memory project when the
first wave of "no more TOPS10" sentiments graced our lives) that would
port to all the CPUs.

We did run SMP on the KI but I don't remember if we supported it.  By the
time we shipped 7.01, there was no more manufacture of KIs--the KLs had
been out for years.

Ampex. We upgraded from 1Mw core memory (I think - I seem to remember four
banks of 256Kw each) to 2Mw Ampex transistor memory in '84.

Peter Lthberg (sp?) from Stacken Computer Club in Stockholm, Sweden, once set
up a hybrid KI/KL Tri-SMP system. Rumor has it that it required a bit of
hardware trickery, but I'm unclear on how much work it was.

I worked on the port of Tymshare's OS (Son of Tops-10) to
the KS10.  Grubbing back into an old resume, this was in
late 1977/early 1978.  I'm not certain at what point a 2020
actually arrived;  we may have been coding from manual
descriptions for some time.

As someone who spent many hours working on -10s and -20s in the 70s and
80s, I am very heartened to find out that there are still a few enthusiasts
out there keeping the legacy of these systems (and software) alive. A few
questions:

Are there any -10s or -20s out there capable of reading old Dectapes?
What is the likelihood that are still readable?

Is the KLH emulator real? What happened to the author? Has anyone looked at
creating an emulator that mapped UUOs and JSYSs to the appropriate windows
or unix calls, thus eliminating the need to recreate that base level
hardware I/O emulations? (that way you could run an old TECO under a
contemporary os within the emulator and feed it already existing files
directly.)

I do find the question of 10/20 emulation somewhat ironic since I wrote
8008/8080/8086 emulators for the 10, and this is basically the reverse.....

Is there another source for the old 10/20 Decus tapes on the net besides
the one on ftp://ftp.dbit.com/pub/pdp10 ? The files are protected.....

Thanks in advance....

PS: I have had a chance to try loggin on to an XKL system and it appears to

   There was only one version of microcode for the KS-10; it was the same for
   TOPS-10 and TOPS-20.

True.  But...

Certainly the same microcode image was used for both Tops-10 and -20, but
there was a mode-bit somewhere that selected which of two totally separate
microcode routines handled the fault.  So in some sense, there -was- some
Tops-10 specific microcode hackery.  (Eventually, microcode space got so
tight that DEC introduced a microcode assembly-time switch so that they
could select which kinds of paging were supported -- I don't know which
possible images were actually used.)

I used the Tops-10 page refill microcode as my model when I wrote the ITS
page refill microcode.  It was a real lifesaver that it was so separate
from the Tops-20 microcode -- it meant that I could see what gyrations I
had to make the micromachine perform without first having to understand all
about Tops-20 paging!

   If it's of any assistance, an original DECsystem10 nameplate I have
hanging in my kitchen says: "DECsystem10". No spaces, no hyphens.

   Singer's argument was about the SYSTEM-10, which they had trademarked
previously to DEC's use of the DECSYSTEM moniker. Sounds a little like
DEC and its 32-bit line and the British manufacturer of vacuum cleaners.

    Peter Lthberg (sp?) from Stacken Computer Club in Stockholm,
    Sweden, once set up a hybrid KI/KL Tri-SMP system. Rumor has it that it
    required a bit of hardware trickery, but I'm unclear on how much work
    it was. 
    
Peter says that the KL was running as a KI, so it was three KI's.  This was
preferred as it gave more blinking lights.

   It was Ampex memory, the same folks who made (make?) industrial-
strength videotape equipment. It had 8 ports available on each box. Of
course, so did the MG- and MH-10s but the third-party memory may have
been cheaper.

   If large enough memory boxes were used _and_ 4-way interleaved only
one K-bus from each KL (yech) needed to connect to any given memory. The
caveat in this is that each of the "boxes" had to be of identical size,
and if a bank in one had to be cut-out, the same bank in all _four_ would
have to go. Obviously, data-channel lines had to connect through all the
memory. It was a slick configuration.

   At ADP in 1983, if I recall correctly, we configured a quad KI system
around the 7.01 monitor in which two of the CPUs had active I/O busses.
It was a lovely system!

This implies that the montior folks named the machines KA10 and KI10.
Perhaps there was internal dither over what letter to use in the
Kx10 name, but I would have expected that to have been set early on.
(Then again, I wasn't there when the KI10 was being designed.)
The KL10 was the KL from the outset, same with KS10:

KA10	discrete transistors 'A' because it was the first.
KI10	I for Integrated circuits
KL10	L for ECL logic
KS10	S for small

Core boxes did a better job sticking to the alphabet.  (MA10 to MH10 or
whatever?)

No, that's not what I meant to imply at all. I'm writing this without benefit 
of a net (I haven't had access to any PDP-10 documentation for years; 
evidence my DECsystem-10 confusion) but DEC marketing wanted the systems 
referred to as the 10/10, 10/20, 10/30, 10/40, and 10/50 for the original 
PDP-10; and 10/70 for the follow-on paged, integrated circuit -10. In 
conditionalizing the monitor sources we could have gone with IFN FT1050, and 
IFN FT1070, but instead as unreconstructed techies we chose IFN FTKA10, and 
IFN FTKI10 because that's what the prints said. Until the KI10 was introduced 
the machine was just called the PDP-10. It just turns out that over time the 
"techie name" prevailed in common usage, else we'd be talking about 10/50s, 
10/70, and 10/90s.

As I typed the above all of a sudden the FT1070 started to look familiar. Can 
anyone refresh my memory? Did we also use FT1070 and FT1077 to distinguish 
between single and multi-processor configurations? About the only 
regular poster here who might remember is JMFBAH, although Bob Clements 
sometimes lurks.

My KA10 (sn 9) was called a PDP-10 - it had the manuals for the 
10/30 monitor and the 10/50 monitor.  The terms "Decsystem, DECsystem
and Tops" were all introduced a little later.  

I might still have some of that doc around - if I ever find it, I will
let people know.  It is pretty cool to look at the really ancient stuff.

No, the KA series was sold as Decsystem 10's also, but perhaps not
until the time when the KA and KI were both being marketed. I have
(somewhere) a book that shows photos (taken in what looks like a gymnasium)
of Decsystem-1030, 1040, 1050, 1055 (master/slave dual CPU), 
1070 and 1077 (KI based, 1 and 2 CPU).

Don't forget that a 2040 with a model-A backplane was limited to
a single section, yet used TOPS-20 style page pointers.  That version of
the KL was incapable of doing extended addressing.  Same for the 2020.

My point is: TOPS-10 without extended addressing and TOPS-20 without extended
addressing are two totally different page table layouts.

Anyway, here is where I picked up the nomenclature:

	     DECsystem-10
	     DECSYSTEM-20
	Processor Reference Manual
	     AA-H391A-TK
	      July 1980

Page 3-21, Figure 3.2: TOPS-10 Process Table Configuration (KL)
  Section 0 is UPT+000 to UPT+377 (512 halfwords)
  Funny Space (Exec pages 340-377) are UPT+400 to UPT+417

Page 3-30, Figure 3.4: Extended TOPS-20 Page Table Configuration
  Sections 0-37 are UPT+540 to UPT+577

Page 3-31, Figure 3.5: Single-section TOPS-20 Page Table Configuration
  Section 0 is UPT+540 only, MUUO and Page Fail are different

Page 4-13, Figure 4.2: TOPS-10 Process Table Configuration (KS)
  Section 0 is UPT+000 to UPT+377 (512 halfwords)
  Funny Space (Exec pages 340-377) are UPT+400 to UPT+417

Page 4-18, Figure 4.3: TOPS-20 Process Table Configuration (KS)
  Section 0 is UPT+540 only, MUUO and Page Fail same as extended KL

Page 5-19, Figure 5.2: Process Table Configuration (KI, TOPS-10)
  Small User is UPT+000 to UPT+017 and UPT+200 to UPT+217
  Section 0 is UPT+000 to UPT+377 (512 halfwords)
  Funny Space (Exec pages 340-377) are UPT+400 to UPT+417

I believe that the chronological order was:

KA with two-seg relocation and protection
KA with BBN pager running TENEX
KI paging, TOPS-10
KL, single section paging, TOPS-20 (MUUO and Page Fail keep changing)
KL, with KI style paging, TOPS-10
KL, extended addressing, TOPS-20
KS, single section, TOPS-20
KS, with KI style paging, TOPS-10
KL, extended addressing for TOPS-10

>It was called extended addressing...NOT TOPS20 style paging.

You're right.  DEC called it "TOPS-10 with extended addressing" in the
software product descriptions.  And a lot of TOPS-20 people would talk about
"KI paging" versus "KL paging", but owners of KLs with KI paging saw
the distinction as "TOPS-10 paging" versus "TOPS-20 paging".

Especially during the period of time when Exec mode was extended but User mode
wasn't.  In our case, we did not have DECnet, the entire exec virtual address
space was still all in section zero, user mode programs were restricted to
section zero, yet the UPT and EPT were changed to the TOPS-20 style without us
getting real extended addressing.

When TOPS-10 was later upgraded to support user programs in non-zero sections,
then we could finally call it "extended addressing".

I guess you can tell I logged more tops-10 time than tops-20...

>How come your -10's were black? Did DEC deliver them that way?

KA based machines were in tall black cabs - more like the PDP11
racks than what most people think of as dec10/20 racks.  They were
really very well built, weighed a lot! (I have moved enough of them
over the years!) KI10 was in the same cabs I think, and maybe one 
of the models of the KL...

Good question to the dec guys here; when DID they stop painting them 
black?  I had some blue doors kicking around, so I know that the tall
cabs went blue at some point; I think that I had a DN87 or DN76 that
had blue doors on it... but I guarantee that my DC10 has black doors ;-)

I believe they were done very, very carefully.  I'm not a monitor
internals programming type (although I participated in a lot of the
design/architecture from 1978-the-end discussions).  When calling UUOs
from UUOs went wrong, they went very wrong; although I seem to remember
that TW/JMF had a lot of fun looking at the crashes and debugging them.

I think these calls were done in user context but I can't for the life of
me remember anybody talking about doing these calls in exec mode.

I saw Bob at Alan Kotok's retirement party.  He only speaks here when us
young things really screw up.  [a smiling emoticon here]  I don't remember
him being on 5-5 and that was when I remember the KI developement
beginning.  Unfortunately, one of the precious things that I had to give
up when I became head of the RUNOFF group was editing the monitor every
Tuesday.  In other words, I didn't have any real contact with the code
when the KI came around. FTMP was used.  FT1070 does seem familiar.  The
only one I can think who may remember is Alan Frantz; I may also still
have the old slides that documented what JMF and TW did to 6.04 sources to
implement SMP.  We dumped a lot of feature test switches that had been
crying to be deleted for years.  

As an aside, 1055 meant dual KA and 1077 meant dual KI; back then it was
only master/slave.

I don't know.

But I _do_ know that on my copy of AA-H391-TK, dated June 1982, the title is

		      DECsystem-10
		      DECSYSTEM-20
		Processor Reference Manual


I also notice that my BLISS REFERENCE MANUAL from CMU (dated January 1970) has
no mention whatsoever of "DECsystem-10" - it only speaks about the PDP-10.

But then, so does my BCPL manuals from the University of Essex, even though
they are dated May 1980. (However, BCPL was first ported to the -10 in 1970,
that may explain the choice of terms used in this newer revision of the
manual.)

The KC10 was the processor designation for the Jupiter.

Marketing got into theis one also:  I have a number of binders in my office
(one from Mark Lottor at the 1988 DEC-20 Day celebration, the others from Joe
Dempster) that read "DECsystem-4050 Sales Training Seminar."

I keep a lot of Toad-1 docs in them.  ;->

The LIRICS KA-10 was the victim of one of the most misguided, insane, evil
projects committed by Suffolk County (LI) BOCES, the program sponsor - it was
handed over to a program for the retarded to "teach them how to de-solder"
after several bids from LIRICS lovers were rejected as "too small."

The PDP-8/I that ran the DCA-680 communications processor did apparently
mysteriously fall off the manifest, though I was never able to determine its
final location. Jerry had a chunk of KA-10 backplane tacked to his wall the
last time I dropped by (1986?)

Jerry is *not* ex-DEC. A high-school teacher for something going on forever,
he got involved in the original Son of Huntington Project (BOCES Instructional
Computer Center) and managed the operation back when it was a 1 1/2-person
shop, the other being the infamous Karen Pepe, secretary, reportedly the first
person to ever hang a Chiquita Banana poster on a computer (The ICC's -8) and
compose "meaningful" poetry with a computer theme <slightly better than Vogon
literature>

No idea where Jerry is these days, let alone Bruce Maier or the rest of the
LIRICS gang....

Memory had nothing to do with it.

The KL10 had a limit of 4MW (16 mobies) of physical memory.  Actually, 4MW
minus one page.  Let's see how many people remember why "minus one
page"... ;-)

I'm not sure, but there may have been such a thing as a 2040 based upon a
model B CPU.  The main thing about the 2040 was that it didn't have a
cache and thus was S-L-O-W.

The main difference between the 2050 and the 2060 was that the 2060 was a
model B CPU.  There was also the business about MOS vs. core memory, but I
can assure you from firsthand experience that there was such a thing as a
2060 with core.

A model B CPU had a virtual address space of 8MW (32 mobies) however the
physical address space was still 4MW.

The 2065 was an end-of-life CPU upgrade, and a surprisingly big win.  The
CPU wasn't any faster, but it doubled the size of the hardware page table
and added a "keep bit".

The hardware page table cached mapping between virtual and physical pages
so that the pager didn't have to go to the page tables for each memory
reference (causing 2-3 memory references per virtual reference).  It was
big enough to hold the full map for an 18-bit kernel and user process. 
But when the kernel and user processes started using extended addressing,
they started getting hardware page table conflict hits, which caused the
entire hpt to be zapped.  I remember that Chuck Hedrick's ELISP had mucho
performance problems until he shuffled memory usage around to avoid this.

The keep bit allowed the kernel to mark its permanent resident pages as
"keep in hpt" so a CLRPT instruction (normally done at each context switch
to clear the hpt) would leave those pages in the hpt.

Together, these two changes made a noticable performance improvement on
TOPS-20.

                  Notes

1. KL10-PA     A basic ECL processor with slots for cache and internal
  (Model A)    channels. Unofficially, this processor is refeeered to as
               the Model A machine.

2. KL10-PV     A KL10-PA that has been modified to include extended
  (Model B)    addressing, more extensive microcode, and a faster clock.
               Unofficially, this processor variation is referred to as
               the Model B machine.

3. KL10-PW     A KL10-PV that has been modified to enable support of
               MCA25.



As has already been mentioned, 1050 is a KA10 system, 1055 KA10
Master/Slave, 1070 KI10 and 1077 KI10 Master/Slave (and maybe even
SMP with TOPS-10 7.00, although not officially). I was talking to
Chuck O'Toole yesterday, and he mentioned that he recalls a 1057
system running (KA10/KI10) master/slave.

As I had mentioned before, my most favorite job at DEC was doing the
TOPS10 monitor edit on Tuesdays.  This was in 1971-72.

The procedure was:

During the week the monitor guys would mark up the listings of the
monitor, and indicate these mark-ups with a monitor change indicator card
on the left hand side of the blue binder (IBM punch cards).  A group of
Tape Prep girls (only their best editors) would go up to 3-5, collect all
the binders that had cards in them, mount the Black Tape that had the
source on it, copy it to disk, edit it, and then do a test assembly for
the obvious errors--undefined, multiply defined, etc.  Back then I think
the command phrase was F+S+module name.  As an edit indication was done, 
the card was reinserted into the listing, only on the right hand side of
the binder.

If everything was determined to be OK, a CREFed listing was generated, the
old listing was put into the "previous edit" binder, and the new listing
put into the "current edit" binder.  These binders were also color coded. 
I think the new listings were dark blue cardboard binders, the old
listings were light blue cardboard binders.  Eventually, when those [UGH!]
plastic binders became the rage,  the "current edit" binders became [of
course] black.  I didn't like the plastic binders because they slipped all
over and couldn't be stacked in a static manner.  

These edits were fun. Especially at the beginning of a implementation
cycle.  After the edit was done, Alan Frantz and Alan Pommer (RAP)  would
take over and do monitor builds.  And the cycle would start all over
again.  

This procedure was followed until I had to stop working with all the minor
changes that had to do with hardware.  For instance, the Black DECtapes
became Black Packs, the number of modules increased,  we didn't have to
type F+S+... anymore.  But a lot of things remained the same.  IBM cards
were still used.  The builds were still done on Tuesdays.  

If the edit was real hairy, it could spill over into Wednesday. 
Sometimes, the monitor guys would request that we do a special edit.  I
think it was because they had so many changes they wanted to work with
up-to-date listings.

There were other times when we would be asked to do an edit of a
previously released monitor (although for the life of me I can't remember
what the hell we called it).  Well, this crud is getting to my memory
recall so I'll have to stop now.

In 71-72 that would be: Tom Hastings, Don Black, Tony Wachs, Jim Flemming, 
John Everett, and Rich Krasin(Manager). At least those are the names I 
recall.

On the left to indicate "still left to do".

I can only remember two, Barbara Huizenga and Margaret (Maggie) (can't 
remember her last name, but I do recall she sold potter's slip as a home 
business).

This isn't the way I remember it. The new listing was just put into the front 
of the binder. A binder could only hold two or three versions of large 
modules like COMMON, but a real edit history could pile up in the binders of 
small modules like CDRSER. I had a real screaming match one day with Alan 
Pommer when he unilaterally decided that each binder would contain just three 
revisions, and threw out literally years of history on some of the small and 
infrequently edited modules I was responsible for.

Some of the special edits were because we were doing large developments in 
privately built monitors, then needed to get the changes back into the 
"official" sources. I don't recall whether this was in 71-72, could have been 
earlier, but Don Black was making the "two segment monitor" at the same time 
I was implementing Extended RIBs. Getting those two development streams back 
together was a herculean effort as I recall.

My (sometimes fuzzy) memory tells me we called them the SOUP listings. On the

SOUP release.

Your posting brought back a memory about the origin of the Black Packs. As 
you mentioned, before the packs there were the Black Tapes; but there were 
tapes of other colors also which I believe identified Production Sources and 
Maintenance Sources in addition to the Development Sources (Black Tapes). I 
remember Alan Pommer carrying around a big piece of cardboard (in which he 
had cut holes and mounted a bunch of empty DECtape reels) and some cans of 
Krylon spray paint. I asked him what he was up to and he said he had decided 
to color code the monitor tapes so people wouldn't pick them up and use them 
as scratch.

Can you remember _why_ you called them the SOUP listings?

Reason I ask is that a former colleague of mine (Tore Haraldsen) in the late
70's wrote a software maintenance tool for the -10 called SOUPE. In SOUPE you
created software decks, sort of like Unix tar archives with builtin revision
histories, ie. you stored the original source code(s) and then the following
revisions as incrementals to the base deck.

We kept all monitor, CUSP and locally developed sources in SOUPE decks, so I
got to use it quite a bit. I never understood the reason for the name "SOUPE",
and never got around to asking Tore.

[SOUPE was written in MACRO-10. In the mid-80s, Tore went on to write a
second-generation SOUPE, renamed SMT - Software Maintenance Tool - in FORTRAN.
I think that was ported to a number of different platforms.]

Soup was the name (I can't rememberwhat it stood for, perhaps SOurce
UPdate) for a system that was used to compare and merge different
successor files of the same file. There were two programs involved, CAM
(Compare And Merge) and FED. 

Having worked with and in the Monitor group in 1974/1975, I know that
this tool was used by TW/JMF. I don't go far enough back to know about
the SOUP tapes/listings that Barb is refering too.

Just a wildass guess; SOUPE was probably "SOUP Extended", after DEC's SOUP 
(SOftware UPdate) suite of programs. SOUP was a series of programs used to 
merge divergant development streams from a common father. DEC released 
maintenance updates in SOUP format, thus the name SOUP releases.

As I recall the SOUP suite consisted of:

CAM -    Compared a "father" and "son" source and produced an edit file.
COMERG - Merged two edit files derived from a common "father" and identified 
         areas of conflict.
FED -    Applied the merged and "conflict resolved" edit file to the "father" 
         producing a "grandson" file.

There were also a couple of variations on CAM which had larger buffers (and 
used more core) one of which was called COMP10 and the other COMP50 (I seem 
to recall).

The real skill in using SOUP was in TECOing the merged edit file to resolve 
the conflicts. The programmer needed to know what each edit was trying to 
accomplish, how to successfully create the code to accomplish both 
objectives, and how FED worked so that the edit file would be applied 
successfully.

The origins of SOUP are lost in the misty haze of PDP-10 history (at least to 
me). Folklore has (had) it that SOUP was written in FORTRAN at some customer 
site, but somehow the sources were lost. For over twenty years DEC and its 
customer sites depended upon SOUP for the successful development and 
maintenance of TOPS-10 software, yet there was no way SOUP itself could be 
maintained. I think it's an interesting commentary on the integrity of the 
operating environment the TOPS-10 system provided over the years that the 
same SOUP executables that were running in the late '60s were still running 
when I left the DEC-10 world in 1988. They may have even begun life as .SAV 
files and transitioned through the .HGH, .LOW and .SHR days to emerge as 
.EXE files. My guess is that SOUP is still successfully running somewhere.

You're right about SOUP; we referred to it as a SOUP edit.  I seem to

Rich Krasin earned a very special place in my heart.

One day we went up to edit the monitor and there was a card in just about
every page of COMMON.  Nanette started to do the COMMON edit.  In those
days, the very first modules edited had to be MONGEN, F, S, COMMON because
they were used in the compilations of all the other modules.  She never
got done with that edit.

The monitor guys had decided that COMMON was just too big and wanted to
split it up into 3 *.MAC files, calling them COMMON, COMDEV, COMMOD.  It
was a horrendous edit.  I took over the edit and still had not finished by
10P.M. that night.  One of the largest problems was that Tom Hastings had
marked up the macro expansions, not the real ASCII bits that were in the
original COMMON.MAC file.  I had to call upon Alan Frantz at least once/15
minutes to decipher what Tom had in mind.  At 10 P.M. Alan had had enough
and took me home (the deal was that I would stay and finish the edit if
someone would provide a ride home).  I think that I spent 10-12 hours
editing that file; that was first and last for me--I never spent that much
time on a single edit.

A couple weeks later, Rich Krasin wrote a memo to my management expressing
appreciation to all the people who had helped in splitting COMMON up. 
Then he spent an extra paragraph which started as "and a special rose" to
me for doing as much of the edit as I did.  Giving me a rose via memo was
precisely the dearest thing to do.  My memories of that rose carried me
through a lot of the bullshit that I was to go through later.  Just one of
the many reasons the TOPS10 Monitor Group was so special.

Yes!! That was the name of the utility I was trying to remember.

Does anyone else remember this: The sources to the CUSPs (DDT, PIP,
FUDGE2, GLOB, etc) came on DECtapes.  Patches to them came on paper tape.
The SOUP program would read the paper tape, locate the appropriate source
file, patch it, and write it back out.

When I put changes into the TOPS-10 monitor at CSM, I had a MIC file that
created FILCOM diffs and SOUPR files.  I used that mechanism to my changes
with the changes from DEC during beta testing.

Ok folks, here's a funny story to tag on to the statement:

>>  The only difference between a 2060 with an I/O bus and a 1091 is the
color of the paint (orange versus blue).  <<

About 1977 I sold a 2050 to a customer in Los Angeles.  Being in the media
business, they wanted to paint the air conditioning equipment and other
stuff in the computer room the same color as the DEC20, that orange.

I called LCG.  "No can do.  We can't sell it.  Talk to manufacturing."
I called manufacturing.  "Oh we buy that from the sombody paint company,
purchasing can give you the number.  Ask for DEC part number mumble.
I called the paint company.  "Sure how many 100 gallons do you want?" 
"Er," my customer needs maybe one gallon."  "Ha, ha.  Can't sell less than
a tank car full."
I called Final Assembly and Test in Marlboro and got the supervisor.  "Do
you have some spare DEC20 orange paint that you use to fix scratches and
dings before shipment that I could give to my customer who just bought a
half million dollar system from us?"  "Sure we got it in spray cans.  But,
even easier, go to the local Toyota dealer and ask for Toyota Truck
Orange--it's what we use.

I never really understood what the lawsuit was about.  All I remember is
that I had to go through all the on-line documentation and change
references to DECsystem-10 at least twice.  I don't remember the
progression of changes; all I remember is that it had to do with the
capitalization and the the dash.

Going through all the on-line documentation was no small feat and I was
real good [if not the best] w.r.t. editing production.  

At that time, there wasn't very much on-line.  Most of the manuals were
produced by typing with a typewriter on paper.  However, all the specs
that were in the TOPS-10 Notebook set were on-line.  The way we had them
stored was on a set of DECtapes which were referred to as the RUNOFF Black
tapes.  There was also a backup set of DECtapes which contained the
previous edit of each file.  I don't remember how many files there were. 
The procedure to edit a file was to mount the Black tape containing that
file, copy the file to disk, copy the file to the backup DECtape, edit the
file, run it off, check edits, correct edits, run it off, and, if correct
copy it to the Black tape.  

By the time I had to do the change yet again (I was told that the lawyers
kept changing their minds), I had the bloody edit down to a science.  It
did involve having two terminals to use that was near the console (so I
could get at the DECtape drives).  I think I always had two DECtape drives
going at a time.

Yup, As I recall, the KC was the Jupiter Aka 2080 Aka 4050. ( have a
couple of DEcsystem 4050 sales training seminar binders in my
office...

The desktop, was code named Minnow, I don't know of a model number for
it. - I don't think it got far enough through the development cycle to
get that.

[SNIP]

Well, I remember is was "soup" as in, "is it soup yet?", sort of slang for
"is it done yet?".

The actual programs were CAM and FED (don't ask me what those names stood for)
but CAM compared two sources and created a "how to create one from the other"
difference file and/or merged several CAM output files.  FED would then
put the whole mess together, starting with a grandfather edition of the file
and create a merged decendent.  This permitted multiple people to make
separate, private editions of a file and blend them back together.  Kind of
what CMS does today with varient streams and "fetch/merge=".  CAM/FED could
take quite a while and often required human help to resolve edit conflicts.
The whole process was likened to making soup, hence "is it soup yet".  I don't
actually remember a program named "soup" explicitly.

Least that's how I remember it.

Answering a previous message by John Everett:

About the time I got involved in Monitor development (circa 1974/75), there
were two listing binders for each module, one (blue) was the current version
and this was what was marked up flagged with punch cards (on the left).  The
other (forget the color, may have just been older/crufty binders) had one
previous version (with the edits checked and the cards moved to the right)
and it also contained all the "diff" file output.  These diff listings were
the history of sorts.

A separate rack held the listings for the previous release of the Monitor, I
think these were black binders.  ECOs to the released version were marked in
a similar fashion to these listings, cards in the left, in case a "letter"
release was needed.

Because of legacies from the OS on which VMS was based -- RSX-11.  This
used PPNs as well -- only they called them UICs instead.  A UIC on RSX was
a 16-bit value, expressed in octal, so they could only go to [377,377]. 
VMS UICs can go higher, since they are 32-bit quantities.  

Other Digital OSes that had their start around the same general era as
TOPS-10 also had PPNs.  RSTS/E and TSS/8 come to mind immediately.

No surprise that TSS/8 used PPNs. Don Witcraft (who co-authored TSS/8) had 
just come from the PDP-6 Monitor Group where he implemented the first 
swapping monitor. Prior to Don's work all active jobs had to be core 
resident.

How many still remember "gentleman's timesharing", where one used to shout, 
"Can anyone "CORE 0"? I need to run an assembly."

Actually, I was only refering to the racks themselves as "well
built" - the cabs that the KA CPU was built in were heavy welded
steel and very substantial.

As to the lack of a real card cage, and modules just plugged in, 
yes, it was a bit cheesy, but if you think about it, it was most
likely the only way to do it.  Adding a cage for hundreds and hundreds
of little boards would have increased the physical size a lot - the 
boards were literally touching each other in the KA, so the cage 
would have made a difference - remember, there were very few cards 
in the KA that were "KA" cards - most of them were just B or R or W
or G series flip chips (not the real flip chips, but the name hung
on for the little modules).  This was a long time before the M modules.  
There were a few (relo and prot registers, fast memory (if you had
that ;-) and some drivers that were specialized to the device, but 
for the most part if you tore apart another device (BC10, DC10, DL10,
etc) you found the same B/R/W/G logic boards.  I used to have hundreds
of the damned things in my kitchen ;-)

>I once watched some movers push a

I once had to seperate the bays of a KA10 CPU (all those damned jumpers
between the backplanes were not labeled) to get each bay into an 
elevator seperately (residential elevator - no freight available) and
then we got them back into place, no errors, perfect first time.  Not
too bad (thanks to Fred Bauer and Carl Zwanzig out there in net land
somewhere for the work on getting the KA up the 17th floor of the 
apartment building...)  I agree, not the most robust construction, and
a complete Connector Conspiracy (better applied to the KL, actually)

I think that I have seen blue KI's, but the CPU might be black, with
the other boxes in blue...  Peter Lothberg owns a few - maybe he can 
just check the warehouse?

Earlier I had talked about the procedures used as part of the TOPS10
monitor development cycle:

<As I had mentioned before, my most favorite job at DEC was doing the
<TOPS10 monitor edit on Tuesdays.  This was in 1971-72.
<
<The procedure was:

I would like to document the hardware that we used.  Back then I didn't
know a bit from a byte although I was picking up the MACRO  language from
typing it.  The system we worked on when we were editing the monitor was
System #2, a KA processor (I'm talking about the system that was on 3-5). 
We used 35s for TTYs (that is pronounced as "tittys").  I think there were
4 DECtape drives.  I have no idea about the rest of the configuration.

Later on, System #2 was coupled with System #40 (which had been the
general timesharing system for the rest of the corporation) and was run as
a dual KA system.

Although I spent a lot of time on System 2, about all I can remember is where 
it was situated in the 3-5 machine room. As you stood facing the console if 
you looked to the right you could see into building 1 out the windows. I do 
remember that for a time the CTY was a KSR37 with upper/lower case. After 
years on the PDP-6 with all upper case, everything looked so weird in lower 
case; and at 150 baud it seemed blazingly fast.

>Later on, System #2 was coupled with System #40 (which had been the

I also spent a lot of time on 2/40 which may have included debugging the 
first multiprocessor release. Whether it was 2/40 or not, I recall it being 
in the basement of building 5. It might not be widely known that the dual 
processor monitor did not originate at DEC, but from MIT's LNS (Laboratory 
for Nuclear Science) installation. Credit should go to T. Michael Church who 
really was the father of DEC-10 multiprocessor systems. We (DEC) took Mike's 
code and extended it to support up to five processors. I was responsible for 
scheduler control (SET CPU, SET RUN, etc.) which as I recall required some 
DAEMON involvement, hence my active participation in the "how to pronounce 
daemon" discussions in alt.folklore.computers.

Problem and programmer numbers were used at MIT on its 7090 batch system
in the 1960s, and also on CTSS.  (Elaine Pearlstein was the department
secretary then at the Comp Center, who handed out programmer numbers.)
Could this be the source of PPNs?

I remember distinctly that the first (and only) KI to be installed in
Portugal, which I helped run during 1975-77, had blue CPU cabinets. Some
of the other cabinets, eg. the disk controller, were all black, I think.

The KI at Whessoe, Darlington, UK definitely had blue cabinets.  We
had a 192K machine - approx 1M, with a 1MIP processor - and we could
support 20 users and provide the main computing resources for an
engineering company with 2000 employees.

"Ahh, use bits in user space" (said ala Homer Simpson).  Nothing like having
the user drag the use bit into cache on CPU1 while CPU0 is trying to set or
clear it after I/O completed for that buffer.  Just when Jim, Tony, and I
thought we'd OUCHE'd the last of these, another would popup.

Actually, putter/taker chase rings are pretty common for I/O devices these
days.  Guess it's another area where TOPS-10 was ahead of the curve.

You should explain this a little bit further just for documenting what the
real problem was:  not having a write-through cache.  Believe it or not,
there are people who think that  the SMP that you guys implemented is
partition computing.

Did Tony ever declare that God never meant for there to be a
non-write-thru cache?  Remember when he declared that God never meant for
there to be magtape?  I adapted the same sentiment when I took over the
maintenence/development for BACKUP.

TV:<<Problem and programmer numbers were used at MIT on its 7090 batch system

Could this be the source of PPNs?>>

Good one, Tom.  Yes, that is almost certainly the origin of PPNs.  
Of course, 7090 style PPNs were decimal, not octal, right?  But
CTSS was certainly the inspiration for a lot of the features in the
early monitor, especially for the PDP-6.

CTSS used to type out the date, the time, and the word "Ready" between
each command and the next.  This got old fast,  especially when it was
paper that was being wasted.  So someone wrote an application you could
run that would intercept the CTSS command processor, and issue its own 
prompt, which was very terse.

And the name of this program?  It was called "POINT".  Get the point?

Nice try, but wrong...it's Program Assembly Language

PAL-8 - The original PDP-8 paper tape based assembler
PAL-D - The first disk based PDP-8 assembler (written by John Everett)
PAL-X - The PDP-6/10 based PDP-8 assembler (written by Bob Bowering)

Bob wrote PAL-X to specs provided by Don Witcraft and me. At the time the two 
of us were busy writing TSS/8 and could never have assembled it using either 
PAL-8 or PAL-D.

I believe the reference is to my friend Bill English.  Height is closer to
6'1" than 6'4".  His friends and colleagues may be interested to know that 
he's still going strong, he's still very funny, and he's still one of the
nicest people any of us will ever meet.  If anyone wants to get in touch
with Bill e-mail me and I will supply a regular mail address.  I don't
believe Bill currently has net access.

By the way, if anyone needs some writing done, I'm pretty sure Bill would
still be interested.
