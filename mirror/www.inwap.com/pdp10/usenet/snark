TENEX had to be renamed.  (Well, I don't know if it _had_ to be, but
marketing secrecy essentially ruled here.)  VIROS was the original
codename, I think.  The trade press got wind of it and the name was
changed to SNARK.  ("They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
They pursued it with forks and hope;", see
http://home.earthlink.net/~lfdean/carroll/snark/fit8.html.)  When SNARK
escaped, we switched to KRANS (Snark spelled backward), but cooler heads
managed to get it back to SNARK.

Near the announcement time, there was a wonderful article in the trade
press that managed to merge snippets of both VAX and SNARK.  It
have referred to a 36 bit PDP-11 or something equally silly.

Well, it did keep them busy and out of the hair of the
people who were doing the real work :-)...but only for a while.

I remember watching all this and being amazed at all the 
programmer time that was spent on choosing names so that 
"they" wouldn't find out what 341 was doing.  The new name
would always leak out to a customer within a week of a
glorious renaming vote.  The only way to keep the new name
a secret (mind you, the project wasn't a secret) would have
been to duct tape marketing's mouths.

Maybe that's where Palmer got the idea that the DECsystem-1070
was a 32-bit machine.
