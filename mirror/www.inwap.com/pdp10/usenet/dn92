Since we're discussing PDP8-based peripheral controllers, did anybody
here ever use a DN92?  I came across the glossy for it one day while
cleaning out old papers bequeathed by a former boss.  It was an RJE
station and (I think) could also handle a few terminal lines.

(Before you ask:  I don't know what became of that glossy, but I don't
throw away interesting stuff so it may turn up again.)

Having seen what's at the edges of the road, I much prefer the dead armadillos.

Yes, you could say I have heard of it, as I worked on the code that
ran in the beast.  There used to be on sitting in the **MIDDLE** of
the machine room, between 1026 and 514.

The unit I used in 1980 was an RJE to a dual KI at the Air Force Avionics
Lab in Dayton. It was 8E based, had a line printer, card reader, and
several serial lines. If memory serves me right, you booted it from
the card reader; I don't remember any other periperals on it that you
could boot from.
