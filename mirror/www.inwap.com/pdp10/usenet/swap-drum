Mark, your memory is not THAT bad but a slight error.  The RC10 was the 
the controller for the RD10 (Burroughs disk) and the RM10 (Bryant Drum),  
The RC10 also required a data channel called the &*10 (DF10 - as my 
failing memory recalls).  

The RM10 had an interesting quirk about it that I have to share;  As the 
drum would "spin up", that is actually what it did.  When it finally got 
up to speed the drum (actually a cone) had moved up to the heads.  This 
was not noticeable by anyone until the unit powered down.  When the drum 
nearly stopped spinning there would be a noticeable "thud" when the drum 
actually dropped away from the heads.  This first time this happened, it 
was a bit scary because it was loud enough to sound serious.
