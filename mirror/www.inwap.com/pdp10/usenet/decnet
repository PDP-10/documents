Yes.  Bill put it in and was shipped with 7.03; that was Phase IV
DECnet.  The only thing that he didn't have time to do was to
allow the KS10 to be an endnode.

My plans were to eventually evolve TOPS-10 to end node only since
the rumor at the time was that DECnet Phase ?? would not "talk"
to previous phase routers.

Your description of the DN81 leaves me a little confused.  I don't
know of any that were directly attached to a -10.

The DN80, 81, and 82, were remote devices, not connected to the -10
directly.  CPU was an 11/40.  Sync interfaces were mostly DQ11s, which
would crank up to 400KB even if 56KB was the supported speed. 

 (Yea, Kalman Reti, Bob Houk  and I actually wired two KLs down in the
old DAS lab via a pair of front ends and DQ11s, and 400KB was the
fastest we could go, but we were only using the RS232 wire, not the
V.35 wire. Shorter wire or V.35 wire would have helped.  This from a
device that the RSX people said could never go faster than 56K.)

The DN85, and 87 were attached to the -10 via the DL10, and the DN87s
was DTE attached.  All DN20s (that I know of) were DTE attached.

If you connected a DN81 to the -10 via the DL10, I would really be a
DN85 (or 87 if it also had serial lines).  Other than that, I think
the hardware was the same.  The DL10 took care of the bootstrap rom.

IIRC, the DMR was a program (register) compatible, lower cost version
of the DMC11.  Owning a DMC got one free membership in the "ROM of the
month" club, as we got new roms just about every month to cure
problems with the device. :-)

I don't know if this one is the DMC line unit or the DMR line

cables that John McNamara and I agreed on.  The integral modem units,

The cables are triax, ie. one center conductor and two concentric
shields.

The cabinet kit has transmit in and out, plus receive in and out.  So, 4
connectors in all, but then two are always terminated for each
interface.  I do not see any indication that these were used as
multipoint.

I'll take a look at the other DN20 cabinets to see if they use the same

There was an IBM RJE product that acted as a remote

I wish I had known about your work; we could have used it
as the basis for our product instead of re-inventing
the wheel.  The DN60 series shipped around 1977 or 1978.

Oh well, we had fun.  The kernel of the DN60 was based
on an early version of the DN80 which I wrote while
consulting for Digital a couple of years previously.
The code I had written never shipped as part of the
DN80 products; it was rewritten after I returned to
Sanders.

That happened at ORNL, too.  The scientists were so used to
IBMese that it was easier to fake them out by pretended the
jobs were run on an IBM.  Instead the job was shipped to their
5-CPU system, processed, then shipped back to the IBM system
in the form that the users expected.

I can't answer your questions directly, but I can tell you that ours was
one of the few DEC-20 sites to have a DN200.  There's some talk about it
here:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/dec20.html#kermit

Ours was installed about 500 meters away from the machine room, connected
by synchronous modems (or maybe a synchronous null modem, I'm not sure),
and communicating with TOPS-20 via DECnet.  It ran a version of RSX-11, but
I can't remember which version, D maybe.  It did not have a hard disk, so
it must have booted over DECnet.

The purpose of the DN200 was to support remote access to the DEC-20.  In
our case, it was in a remote terminal room.  32 terminals (DECwriters and
CRTs) were to be connected to its serial ports, and it also had an LP20
drum printer.  In fact, we wound up not using the serial ports since we
already had something else (a Gandalf PACX IV) that worked better and more
simply, but we did use the printer.

We also had a number of DN20s, which were also PDP-11/34's.  Each DEC-20
used its own DN20 as a DECnet front end, and this is how our DEC-20s were
interconnected before the NIA20 (Ethernet) and CI came along.  We also had
connections to our departmental VMS and TOPS-20 systems, and to 8 or 10
other universities, including CMU, NYU, Case, etc, forming a large DECnet
network, complete with intersite email, "telnet" sessions, and so on,
that lasted 8 or 10 years.

A separate DN20 provided an RJE (HASP) connection to our IBM mainframe.
You could actually submit jobs in the form of virtual decks of cards (JCL
sandwiches) from the DEC-20s to the mainframe, and get the results back as
virtual 132-column printouts.  The HASP DN20 also ran a form of RSX-11.

So that's what the DN200 and DN20 were for, at least in the TOPS-20 world.
The ANF-10 was something entirely different.  It was the IMP interface,
and I don't think it had anything in common with the DN20 or 200.  It also
cost a lot more, more than $50,000.00 as I recall.  We didn't have one;
by the time our DEC-20s joined the ARPANET, it was possible to do so 
through Ethernet.

ANF-10 was NOT the IMP interface.  That was the AN10, or the AN20
(depending on the cab and it's colour).  ANF-10 (Software) was the
link state routed network code that the -10 supported before there was
DECnet.

In the pre-DECnet days, DEC's data center was full of -10s, and almost
every Manufacturing plant had a -10 for data processing.  All of them
were wired in one large network that was about 250 nodes, based out of
Parker Street (PK1). 

The AN10 had a single 1822 interface (either local or remote) and was
an I/O device connected directly to the -10 CPU.  There was one on
KL1279 and KL2102 in the marlboro lab.  It was a hand built device, as
demand was very, very low, and build by DAS manufacturing for Federal
Systems.  

Somewhere I still have my copy of the 1822 interface spec.
