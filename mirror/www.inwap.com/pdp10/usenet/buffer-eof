You're right Barb, the fragment I quoted wasn't touching a buffer use
bit (which is a public bit) - it tests the secret "this buffer hit EOF"
bit.  The code you haven't seen is what clears the use bit
(status's sign bit).

Here's the whole enchilada.  The routine runs around until it hits all
the buffers, or the buffer containing EOF (whichever comes first),
clearing all use bits along the way:

"
;Routine to clear the "use" bits of all active buffers, and
; return how many there were in T1.

%CLRBC:
CLRBCB:	SETZM	ICNT(D)			;CLEAR BUFFER CONTROL BLOCK
	HRLOI	T1,7700			;EXCEPT BYTE SIZE IN PNTR
	ANDM	T1,IPTR(D)
	MOVE	T2,CHAN(D)		;GET CHANNEL
	HRRI	T2,.FOWAT		;SETUP FOR WAIT
	MOVE	T1,[1,,T2]		;DO FILOP
	FILOP.	T1,
	 $ECALL	IOE,%ABORT

	SETZ	T1,			;CLEAR ACTIVE BUFFER COUNT
	HRRZ	T3,IBCB(D)		;GET PNTR TO BUFFER
	MOVEI	T2,(T3)			;COPY IT
FNDUSE:	MOVE	T4,-1(T3)		;GET STATUS WORD
	TLNE	T4,40			;TAPE EOF?
	 AOJA	T1,USEDON		;YES. WE'RE DONE
	MOVE	T4,(T3)			;GET THE USE WORD
	TLZE	T4,(1B0)		;TURN OFF. WAS IT ON?
	  ADDI	T1,1			;YES. ADD TO ACTIVE COUNTER
	MOVEM	T4,(T3)			;PUT IT BACK
	HRRZ	T3,(T3)			;GET WHAT IT POINTS TO
	CAIN	T2,(T3)			;POINTING TO CURRENT BUFFER?
	  POPJ	P,			;YES. WE'VE DONE IT
	JRST	FNDUSE			;AND TRY AGAIN
USEDON:	HRLOI	T4,377777		;TURN OFF USE BIT JUST IN CASE
	ANDM	T4,(T3)
	POPJ	P,
"

Strictly by coincidence, I just found that BACKUP refers to the same
secret buffer EOF bit.

From BACKRS.MAC
