Re: the Holy Day of Dec 10 and the minor festival of Dec 20....

We must note that we are coming toward the end of the first year AD (After
DEC) previous years to be numbered BC, for obvious reasons.

1 AD, like 4,7,9 and 15 AD has been/will be celebrated with 18 minor festivals
2 AD with 24 fast days
3 AD will have one major festival, though 6, 10 and 20 will each have 36 minor
5,8 and 12 AD will have 12, as will every eighth year that follows after 16 AD
(to be nammed the the Jubilee Years of S,I,L,E,M and A, though the prophets
say  24 AD <8/S> will seem to go on forever)
14 and 16 AD will be the years of honoring the Controller.

Celebrations will be marked by the ringing of Bells.

The orthodoxy prohibits any festivals in years 11 AD and requires a fast day
on Nov. 16 of that year.

The reform movement celebrates 11 AD and plans to celebrate like mad in the
12th Century AD with almost every year a festival year concluding with the
winter solstice festival of Vax. They should be shunned, the orthodox say.

High priests of the Faith shall be recognized by the large aluminum-framed
module worn as a pectoral.

Lesser clergy shall wear (from highest to lowest ranking) R,B and W flipchips
around their necks. The eldest 12-bitters shall wear S-series chips, while the
highest-ranking 36-bitters shall wear B-212s with the original resistors and
scorch marks still in place.

All adherants may wear G and M flipchips around their necks as a sign of
faith. A recent movement of tat minority of members who "go both ways" have
adopted the A-series flipchip as their symbol of faith.

The central alter of the faith shall include a round vector graphics display
and an almost-working ASR-33.

I propose that celebrations of AD events be marked by the
ringing of VT52 Bells :-)

No, no, no.  It should be a Model 35...   The VT52 is much too recent.
And the mechanical bells sound much nicer and carry much further.  I can
still remember the characteristic sound of a parity error, and, of course,
bells on the half-hour.

I think the Macintosh version of 'gzip' has a comparable bell 'snd' resource
inside of it, if you don't have a Model 35 lying around somewhere...  (Gosh,
i should extract it for LINUX once of these days.  *grin*)
