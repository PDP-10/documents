Yes. The WS78 used the 6100 and the DECMate I,II,III used the 6120
which was faster and higher integration.

They (the 6100 chips etal) were widely available in the late 70s early
80s and fairly cheap.  It didn't  take much to build a system using
the 6100 and I still have mine(operational).

Recently I brough up OS278 on a DMIII and its very interesting.

late 70s, 1976 was the introduction of the 6100 and 1981 was the
introduction of the 6120 which integrated the 6100 and the 6101.

I bought my first 6100 in early '79 for something like $12.

The part wasy available and low cost.  It was second sourced by harris
semi as well.  There are several other chips the PIE(Peripheral
interface element), MEDIC (Extended memory, DMA and timer).  

It was widely used for low power control systems in sealed cabs where
heat was a concern and the 12 bit word made it more compatable with 10
and 12bit A/D or D/A converters.  Another use was to replace larger
and harder to maintian PDP-8 system in use.

In Kilobaud Microcomputing december 1979 there was an article about
the intersil CMOS sampler package. The $49 price got you CPU, 256words
ram, 1k rom with ODT, a PIE and UART.  For $39 more an etched board it
could be put on.

I have one and I still play with it as it's extended to 3kw ram and a 
bunch of parallel ports.

From my small computer handbook.
The 685 is simply a switch which allows the 681 to be connected to any one
of 64 teletype lines.  It has the IOT's for it, a little long to type
right now, email if you need it.

Seems to have same IOT as standard console port.  Normally they were
Line IOT
1    40/41
2    42/43
3    44/45
4    46/47
5    11/12

Special model for 8/S that went inside an ASR-33 (PT08A) used
03/04 (normal console IOT).  

I have print set but it does not have programming information other than
table above.  It uses a W706/W707 which I assume is functionally the
same as the M706/M707 in an 8/I but negative bus with RTL IC's.

They were about a half row double high in a 19" rack mount.  Attached to
the external negative bus on original 8, 8/S and 8/I.  I have one but
have not tried it yet.  How many you can have is the external bus limit
on number of devices/cable length.

If you think the print set will be of use I can put it on the scan pile.

This cognoscente can't elaborate on the relationship between TSS/8 and
RTS8, but as co-author of TSS/8 I can shed some light on the origins
of that system and its supporting hardware.

During the late '60s Gordon Bell had taken a "leave" from DEC and was
a professor of computer science at Carnegie-Mellon. He had a Dutch
grad student named Adrian Van Der Goor (sp?). Somehow between the two
of them they came up with the idea that with some small hardware mods
a time-sharing system could be built for the PDP-8. Gordon and Adrian
visited Maynard sometime in 1967 or 1968 (I'm guessing) and made a
presentation to some execs and also some of us in the (tiny) PDP-8
programming group. Gordon sort of just oversaw the meeting; Adrian
made the presentation.

The proposal was to create a "time-sharing option" which would create
"user mode" and "exec mode" run states. In user mode all I/O
operations, HLT, switch register reads, etc. would cause an interrupt.
Of course at interrupt the system would switch into exec mode.

The proposed time-sharing monitor would reside in page 0, while user
images and swappable parts of the monitor would reside in extended
memory. It was proposed to give each user a 4k virtual (basic) PDP-8.
The design of the monitor (as we then called operating systems) would
be based upon a research system originally proposed (and perhaps
actually built) for a PDP-4 or PDP-7. I can't now recall where the
design came from, but it was described in detail in a computer science
text of the period.

The Time-Sharing Option was designed by a junior member of PDP-8
engineering who's name I've long since forgotten. Don Witcraft, who
had worked on the PDP-10 monitor (later to be called TOPS-10) and I
wrote TSS/8 based upon the suggestions made by Gordon and Adrian.

BTW, the system was initially to be called TS-8, a name which
persisted during most of its development. We changed it to TSS/8 when
IBM announced TSS/360. It just seemed so right!

One of the catch phrases around DEC at the time, "Man is going to the
moon, and time-sharing on the PDP-8."

It was pretty slow, since it just cranked away one operator at a time
creating and discardit array temporaries.  The reason APL\360 gained
popularity was that it was well designed for time-sharing with very
efficient context switching and monitor that let you run dozens of
users on a 360/50 with snappy response.

In later years people started doing compilation with interesting
optimizations like type and shape inference, but that wasn't until the
mid 1970s.

I wrote an APL subset to Basic compiler as a class project in 1972
(written in Trac, believe it or not) that built up Basic expressions
representing arbitrary elements of APL expressions and only generated
loops when it needed to store an array or print a value. I later
realized it was considerably ahead of the then state of the art in APL
compilers.

I'm SO GLAD you asked, since I happen to have the Functional
Characteristics manuals for the 360/67 and 360/30 here.  (I bought
them from IBM's web site a year or two ago.)

The /67 was a pretty fast machine for the mid 1960s with 32 bit
integer datapaths, 200ns cycle time, and a 60 bit adder for floating
point.  Register to register integer load or add was 650 ns,
memory-to-register load was 1.2us, add 1.4us.  Floating add from
memory 2.43us single, 2.45us double.  Floating multiply 4.4us short,
7.6us long.  Floating divide 7.3us short, 14.1us long.  Floating
compare 1.98us, conditional branch 800ns not taken, 1.1us taken.  The
dual processor machine was slightly slower, 690 ns load, to 14.33us
floating divide.

The /30, on the other hand, was really slow.  It was byte serial, 1us
cycle time and 2us memory cycle on early machines, later sped up to
750ns and 1.5us, and microcode did everything including simulating
channel I/O.  Register to register integer load was 17us, add was
22us, memory-to-register load was 24us, add 29us.  Floating add from
memory 52us single, 69us double.  Floating multiply 208us short, 472us
long.  Floating divide 301us short, 1665us long.  Floating compare
65us, conditional branch 21us not taken, 22us taken.

I'm not surprised.  The 8/e was a 12 bit machine with 1.2us memory and
hard-wired instructions that ran the memory at full speed, giving it a
head start over the /30's 1.5us memory and microcoded instruction set.
Also, the floating point package around which Focal was built was
quite well written.
