It's a bit misleading to offer C as the language that drove the
standards used for the Internet.  Many of these standards have
been inherited (often with great revision) from the early days (early
1970's) of ARPAnet, and long predate Unix or C.  Think of TENEX and
Multics and Fortran and COBOL, not of C and Unix.  C and Unix were
complete non-players in setting these standards.

The early recognition of the need to hook widely different 
computers into some grand naming scheme - had to take into
account many factors:

1.  Machines used different character sets.  Yes, ASCII was one
of those character sets, but EBCDIC, truncated versions of ASCII,
and other "proprietary" character sets were in wide use.  If you
wanted a name to be universal, it had damn well better be typable
on all the machines in the network.  And it's just plain wrong
to think of today's interpretation of ASCII, because in the late
60's and early 70's many of the ASCII codes were still
being revised by the committees.

2.  Even if a user was accessing a machine that was capable of
upper and lower case, they may be accessing through a terminal
(like a Model 33) without lower case characters.  So case sensitivity
is a no-no.

3.  Between character sets, you can count on letters, numbers,
and some *very common* punctuation being available.   The only
punctuation codes that were widely available on all machines -
when you look at what's in common between commercial and scientific
character codes - you're limited to "-", "/", ".", "$", and ",".

4.  The "variable name must begin with letter, not a number"
scheme was in use long before the 1970's.  Early Fortran (and I'm
talking early 1960's) did this, and it wouldn't surprise me if
there are earlier languages and/or assemblers that did it as well.

So why was "-" allowed, but not those other 4 characters?  I dunno.
Many technical standards were chosen not for technical reasons,
but because they were convenient or just because *something* had
to be chosen.  Why are the AC electrical systems around the world
dominately 50Hz and 60Hz?  You can go into long explanations about
gearing ratios and subdividing circles and transformer weight and
motor cooling, but the fact is that some
number had to be chosen as a standard, and those are what was agreed
on, even though they certainly weren't the only choices available,
and possibly not even good choices for some factors.

And just like many AC power frequencies haven fallen into disuse
(it wasn't that long ago that 25Hz power was used in many places), many
internetworking naming conventions have fallen out as well.  It
was only a few years ago that everybody talked about bang paths
and knew that in the UK that the endianess of the components of a name
was reversed, but you're hard pressed to find anyone remembering those
days now.  Heck, ten years ago all the major archive sites on the
Internet were PDP-10's, and today you're hard pressed to find a
FTP client that knows about TENEX mode.  Things change, and it
wouldn't surprise me if the current host naming scheme was junked
and forgotten just as quickly as those other conventions.

Oh yeah, right, the character set for DNS host names has nothing
at all to do with ARPANET names, that's why the early DNS related
RFC's contained statements like 

  The labels must follow the rules for ARPANET host names.

(Above quote appears in both RFC 1035 and RFC 883).  Come on,
Richard, if you want to put up a fight at least put one up that
isn't easily disproven by looking at the DNS RFC's.

In any event, in the mid 80's all the character-set compatibility
issues I specifically mention were still relevant.  The Internet
was still dominated by TENEX, ITS, and other non-Unix and non-C
machines. Just look at the HINFO fields from any mid-80's host database
and you'll see few (if any) Unix machines.  For instance, of the
"standard" HINFO names from RFC 883, only two were capable of running
a Unix at the time:

            PDP-11/70   C/30        C/70        VAX-11/780   
            H-316       H-516       DEC-2060    DEC-1090T    
            ALTO        IBM-PC      IBM-PC/XT   PERQ         
            IBM-360/67  IBM-370/145   

and indeed in the OS field these are the suggested
choices:                    
 
            ASP         AUGUST      BKY         CCP          
            DOS/360     ELF         EPOS        EXEC-8       
            GCOS        GPOS        ITS         INTERCOM     
            KRONOS      MCP         MOS         MPX-RT       
            MULTICS     MVT         NOS         NOS/BE       
            OS/MVS      OS/MVT      RIG         RSX11        
            RSX11M      RT11        SCOPE       SIGNAL       
            SINTRAN     TENEX       TOPS10      TOPS20       
            TSS         UNIX        VM/370      VM/CMS       
            VMS         WAITS                                   

Unix and C simply weren't major players at the time the standards
were set.  Anyone claiming otherwise is itching for a fight.
