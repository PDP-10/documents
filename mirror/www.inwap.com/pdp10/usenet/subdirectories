CTSS directories were named after your problem number and programmer
number.  Each problem number also had some "common file directories"
usable by all users on the project.  So there was a sense in which
there was a static hierarchy.. but CTSS users really wanted to make
subdirectories and organize their stuff below their home directory,
and there was no way to do this.  This feature was one of the big
selling points for Multics.
