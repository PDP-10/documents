It's real.  Rob Supnik is a VP of Digital.  He arranged this license at the
request of John Wilson and I (and probably others).

I'm volunteering to run an FTP site for PDP-10 software that people
are willing to share with other licensees:

	ftp.brouhaha.com:/pub/pdp-10/

There's nothing there yet except an incoming directory in which people can
place contributions.  If you upload something, please also upload a
something.README so I have a clue what it is.

I don't yet know whether Digital minds if I make their PDP-10 software
available for anonymous FTP.  Until I find out, I will create FTP-only
accounts for those who send a signed copy of the completed license agreement
by postal mail to:

	Eric Smith
	142 N. Milpitas Blvd. #379
	Milpitas, CA  95035
	USA

I'm requesting donations of images of DEC software distribution tapes of
TOPS-10, TOPS-20, layered software, diagnostics, and anything else
related, in source and/or object form.  If it necessary for a donor to have
proof of licensing, I'll mail out a copy of my completed license agreement.

Hi,

I also suggest collecting the old DECUS tapes and similar TOPS-10/20
software. At least DECUS does not keep them online anymore.

I am ready to offer a mirror site in Finland :)

If you are a home collector of Digital's 36b systems, you can now have
a free, personal use, non-commercial license for your existing system
software (TOPS-10, TOPS-20, and related layered products and
utilities).  Simply fill in the attached license form and return it to
Dick Greeley in Digital's Corporate Licensing Office
(rgreeley@powdml.enet.dec.com).  This license grants you a 
free, as is, non-commercial license for using 36b software on a home
system.  You must already have, or have access to, the software
itself; the license does NOT include any distribution medium,
documentation, or support.

My apologies for the email address; I borrowed a friend's account on
an ISP to post this note, because my own news server was down (and
still is).  This is a real note; Digital issued a similar license for
OS/8 about two months ago.  If you have collected a Digital 36b system
for personal use, this license allows you to use the system software
without fee on an as-is, no support basis.

Again, I'm sorry about the email address.

Do you really have to have a physical 36b system in your possession in order
to gain access to the source code?

I'd really like to be able to read through the 7.03 SCNSER and GALAXY sources
once more, although I have given up hope ever to log on to a T10 system again.

If I purchase a -20 (or -10) somewhere, I don't *need* permission from DEC to
use it as a hobby machine.  What I do need permission for, however, is to
use/copy the *software*.  Without a license, the previous owner can't legally
transfer a copy of the software to me, unless that owner somehow magically
had posession of media without having signed a license (which should never
happen).

When John and I asked Rob Supnik if he could arrange for -10 and -20 software
licenses, we specifically wanted licenses that would both allow us to
legally run any -10 and -20 software we had access to, *and* to allow us to
legally acquire the software from other licensees (commercial or otherwise).
As far as I know the hobbyist license which Rob Supnik arranged to be made
available to the entire community fills both of those requirements; I can't
find any language in it to the contrary.  Of course, I'm not a lawyer so
YMMV.

> Since they weren't covered by the standard commercial license, they
> wouldn't be covered by the hobbyist license either.

I asked Rob Supnik about the diagnostics, the microcode, and the front-end
software (which could perhaps be considered to be -11 software rather than
-10/-20 software), and he confirmed that the all of this software *is*
covered by the hobbyist license.

The customer could purchase a diagnostic license and media, but was not
required to do so.  Field Circus would use their own if the customer didn't
have one (and perhaps even if they did).  But I could easily see why the
Field Circus copy would be locked up; that would make sense even if the
customer *did* have a license.

The last time I checked (less than a year ago), the KL10 and KS10
diagnostics were still on the DEC price list!

Cheers,
Eric

Sorry, the "it" in the sentence you quote was "TOPS-20", not the PDP-10.  It
was obvious to me, at least, that that was what I meant!  ;-)

And the remainder of Eric's message demonstrates that I should have read both
the hobbyist license, and the licenses at Stanford, a lot more closely.

Sorry for raining on anyone's parade!

Licensed source *is* covered by the hobbyist license.  It is stated in
THE VERY FIRST SECTION of the license agreement that:

    SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY shall mean the sources and binaries to the TOPS-10 and
    TOPS-20 (operating systems), and associated utilities and layered products

Note that it says nothing whatsoever about "distribute".

That's one problem.  The other problem is whether or not the PDP-10
architecture is part of "DIGITAL's INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS" --
remember that the byte instructions were patented.

Last but not least, every ex-DEC employee and contractor (I am among the
latter) had other signed contracts.  The hobbyist license clearly
guarantees my right to continue possession of software that I acquired
under those contracts, and renders moot any destruction requirements;
however, there is nothing in the hobbyist license that releases me from
the other terms of those contracts.

I've seen references to the one granted in 1985 on *software*
manuals (see http://www.decdocs.org for one reference to it).
If there is a similar dispensation for other manuals that
would be something I've not seen before. Do you have a reference
to this?
