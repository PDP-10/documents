An RT-11 port of FLECS is available in the flecs* directories at

ftp://ftp.trailing-edge.com/pub/rt11freewarev2/split/sigtapes/tors84/

The manual there mentions that:
  
        At Oregon, FLECS is implemented on both the DECsystem-10 and
        the  IBM  S/360.   The manner of implementation is that of a
        preprocessor that translates  FLECS  programs  into  FORTRAN
        programs.   The  resulting FORTRAN program is then processed
        in the usual way.  The translator  also  produces  a  nicely
        formatted  listing  of  the  FLECS  program that graphically
        presents the control structures used.

It also references other versions:
