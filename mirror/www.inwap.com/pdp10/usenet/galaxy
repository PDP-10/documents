NEBULA is part of GALAXY.

GALAXY is part of the operating system, but not part of the monitor.  It is the
spooling subsystem, handling batch, printing, plotting, and card I/O.  It was
common to Tops-10 and Tops-20 (although some pieces only existed in one or the
other--I think PULSAR was Tops-10 tape-handling, for example), violating the
coding standards of both.

On Tops-20, Galaxy consists of QUASAR (the central message clearing house),
ORION (the backend part of operator communications), OPR (the operator inter-
face), MOUNTR (tape and disk handling), BATCON (the batch subsystem), and
NEBULA (communications between systems in a CI-based cluster).  These parts,
and the EXEC (the user command interface), use the Inter-Process Communications
Facility to pass messages back and forth.

QUASAR, ORION, MOUNTR, BATCON, and NEBULA run as subforks of Job 0, which is
the monitor's interface to the outside world--a number of subsidiary processes
of the monitor itself appear as subforks of Job 0.  OPR is a user-level program
used to communicate with the others to allow operators to manipulate queues,
mount and dismount tapes and disk, and so on; general user services such as
queuing a print job as taken care of by EXEC commands.

I'm sure that Tops-10 works very much the same way, modulo the difference in
user interface (no EXEC--commands are interpreted by part of the monitor, so
commands such as QUEUE are separate user programs).  Right, Barb?  Chops?

To wrap it up, MPB means "MultiProgram Batch".  It's the first-generation
spooling system on the -10 which GALAXY replaced.

But only on TOPS-20.  TOPS-10 didn't implement loosely coupled 
systems; we did SMP instead.

Coding standards or ANSI tape handling?  I suspect you  mean the
latter.

Right.  One of the strengths of GALAXY was the module GLXLIB
which was a library of routines that provided the monitor
calling interface for IPCF, memory management, etc.  CUSPs
that we wrote after GALAXY became a product would use GLXLIB.
That way, if written correctly, a lot of development time
was saved because all that difficult memory management and
IPCF didn't have to be coded again and again and again.

And on TOPS-10, when the system came up, all of the above described
as forks were [1,2] jobs.  [1,2] was the privileged user access
account.

I can't remember any commands on TOPS-10 that didn't run a user
mode program other than flavors of SAVE.  It seems to me that 
there was some command something like DUMP (but that doesn't 
sound right) that would save the user address space to a disk
file for debugging purposes but that was in the real olden
days almost before my time :-).

What's chops?

To make a short story long....

In the period from 1970 to 1973 a new batch and spooling system was
developed for the DEC10 called MPB -- Multi-programming batch -- 
designed primarily by Peter Conklin. It consisted of a bunch of programs
called QUEUE, QMANGR, BATCON, LPTSPL, CDRSTK, etc. It was a major step
forward for these types of capabilities on the -10 but it was based on
Shared Segments and disk-based queues and was very slow.

During 1973 a new memory-based interprocess communications system was
developed in TOPS10 called IPCF and also a software interupt facility.
So late in '73, Chuck O'Toole and I set out to rewrite the system from
scratch based on these new facilities. The core was QUASAR, the queue
manager and the other programs were written to talk to QUASAR -- BATCON,
SPRINT, LPTSPL->SPROUT. Etc. It was fast and worked well -- although in
subsequent years the software was stretched (by me and others) beyond
where it should have been, as is often the case.

TOPS20 was just starting around these period and we knew that it would
have to work on TOPS20 also so we tried to make it OS independent right
from the beginning. We succeeded pretty well with that and I'd say that
probably 90% of all of the software ran unmodified on both OSes. This
was due to a fair of amount of library usage and modularity.

Hope that helps.

Hmm.  I thought Don Mastrovito talked about... no, he talked about new stuff in
7.04.  Jack Wong!  Jack talked about changes in Galaxy, and I got the impres-
sion (obviously mistaken) that there was a Nebula for Tops-10 as well as for
Tops-20.  (I chaired the DECUS session in which Tops-10 7.04 and Tops-20 7.0
were announced to the world, having participated in the 7.0 field test.  Lemme
see, was that Cincinnati '88?  Or Hot-lanta '89?)

Sorry, the parenthetical comment about PULSAR et al. should be ignored to read
that right:  Galaxy was common to Tops-10 and Tops-20 and violated the coding
standards for both.

An example:  In Tops-20, the standard is to call ACs 1-4 by the names T1-T4; as
we learned here at XKL, the monitor stack pointer, called P in both OSes, is
AC1 (AC 17 in Tops-20 and in XKL's unreleased port of Tops-10).  In the Galaxy
sources, ACs 1-2 are S1-S2, and T1-T4 are ACs 3-6.

I stand by my comment regarding coding standards...

Took me a long time to understand GLXLIB internals, too.  Tops-20 doesn't *use*
the PORTAL instruction (it's just another JRST), so there were all these (to my
way of thinking) unnecessary jumps to jumps (branches to branches).  But it's
OK, I understand now ;-).

GLXLIB is impressive.

Oh, you may not be mistaken.  That bunch could have talked about
implementing TOPS-10 on the Alpha (that's how screwed up they 
got).

Ah, now I understand what you meant :-).

>I stand by my comment regarding coding standards...

Ahem....there weren't any coding standards.  There were
standards within product but there were none across products.
IIR there were reasons why the ACs that GALAXY picked were
odd like that but I don't remember specific details.  I got
to "listen over the wall" when Chuck and Larry were designing
(since Chuck's office was kitty-corner from mine) and they
did spend a lot of time talking about it.

There were reasons (although they may have been folklorish from
pre-pdp10 days, that AC 17 was picked for PDL pointer in CUSPs.
I know that I defined my ACs the way I did just because the 
CUSP listing that I was reading did it that way.  The way
one got trained on the -10 was a mentor would say, "Go read
DIRECT, and then start writing your program."  There were no
standards.  Anything that was standardized was essentially
a side-effect of how we learned to write code.  So, when I
wrote the ACTDAE (accounting daemon), I planned to use
GLXLIB for my IPCF and memory management.  The only thing I
had to standardize was my calling sequence which was to pass
arguments to GLXLIB via two specific ACs.  The rest was 
invisible to me.  To figure out how to do GLXLIB stuff, I 
asked JMF and he said, "Go read FILDAE (file daemon)".  Then
I had to something else and I was pointed at another CUSP.
When I had to add switches or something to BACKUP, I looked
at DIRECT to figure out how to use SCAN.  It was a bad choice
because the use of SCAN in DIRECT was different than the 
use of SCAN in BACKUP.  There just was no documentation on
how to code.

Chuckle.  That's what you get trying to figure out what a 
program does by $Xing through the code.

Oh, yea.  I was so glad that piece was around.  Memory management
is such a bear--I was glad to leave it to those guys to maintain
a working piece of code.  The last thing I wanted to debug was
(yet another) memory manager shuffler.

Barbara's right on with this stuff. There were really no concrete and
documented coding conventions -- just a bunch of loose agreements. We
just created our own based loosely on the other stuff that was around.
My recollection (and it was a long time ago) was that we added the S1/S2
registers to the standard convention because we were learning at the
time that the TOPS20 JSYS used these registers and we wanted to keep
them free "for arguments" in general. I haven't thought about this stuff
in 20 years and forgot all about these things but it comes back vaguely.

And yes, the best way to learn was to read somebody else's code. JMF and
TW sent me in that direction lots of times.

Rich, Larry:

Here are some Galaxy memories:

For quite some time, I was Columbia University's full-time Galaxy Guy.
From 1980 to 1988, Galaxy wouldn't print to anything but a magnetic
tape or a REAL line printer.  If you wanted to print something on a
vanilla DEC20 Galaxy, you had to have either a local printer hooked
off of the front end or you had to spring for a DN20, put up DECnet
and take your chances with a DN200 or do something DN60'ish.  All were
expensive alternatives, except that one usually worked and others
didn't.

As the university had chaotic cash flow and a need for many systems to
print to many different printers, I wound up doing a lot of Galaxy
surgery.  I hacked ours to allow LPTSPL to user serial printers on
DH11's (a trivial piece of work, *everybody* did this) and to allow
LPTSPL to spool print requests between our six DEC20's.

That was a little more work; I wrote a server program that used DECnet
to make a DEC20 look like a DN200 workstation.  After the server (LSRV)
on one 20 gobbled up all the output from a client 20 that thought it
was talking to a DN200, the server went and submitted a print request
to Quasar by crafting an IPCF page using symbolic offsets from GLXMAC.
Pretty ugly, but it worked.

Anyway, during all those years, Columbia maintained a full-time Galaxy
Guy (me), one to two Exec people and one to two to three Monitor
people, depending on how many staff we had floating around.

I wound up with Galaxy because I had Tops-10 experience which everyone
(myself included--silly me!) assumed would enable me to understand
Galaxy better.  We needed all these people to maintain all our hacks
which we had to have in order to provide reasonable service and keep
our students from clobbering the machines.  In terms of how Galaxy
communicated, it was nothing like MPB (thank God).  MPB...  Well,
older Tops-10 people can rave about that better than I can...

It's not surprising that PJRST confused you at first; PORTAL doesn't
do much under Tops-20, although there was some talk of actually have
it be functional at some point.  GLXLIB *is* impressive, but not for
what it did under Tops-20!

Under Tops-20, a great deal of GLXLIB didn't even assemble.  For
example, the entire GLXPFH file which contains the Tops-10 page fault
handler code for GLXLIB is unnecessary under Tops-20 (Yea!).  Then
there's GLXSCN which handles COMND% type thingies; it compiles very
little code under Tops-20.  But...

What really makes GLXLIB impressive to me is that it did one hack of a
job of making Tops-10 do lots of fun Tops-20'ish things.  Go look at
all the code in GLXSCN to do automatic nice things for parsing.  Go
look at how GLXPFH is integrated with GLXMEM to provide a very nice
paging subsystem.  Then there was all the file handling stuff in
GLXFIL to shield you from having to worry about Tops-10 buffers.
Great stuff!

However, this produced some pretty odd looking conditional code and
control flow in certain modules because they had to be coded to work
under Tops-10 and thus couldn't take advantage of some of Tops-20's
advanced features.  One example was the use of an RPACS% loop in
M%INIT in GLXMEM.  I wound up replacing the entire thing with a single
XRMAP% call; but that broke compatibility with Tops-10.

The bottom line was that you could be a DEC20 user and just go over
and run a Galaxy program under Tops-10 and things acted like you
expected them to.  That meant less retraining.  To people who really
understood what kind of bit-banging and munching was going on under
the hood, it was just kind of--well--pretty cool, I guess.


Larry--speaking as somebody who cut his teeth on some of this stuff, I
really have to tell you that Galaxy was one heck of a job!  It took me
about three months to understand the Quasar failsoft file format.
Once I did and got the idea of how headers were kept in memory while
the bulk of a request were on disk, I remember having the
following reaction: My eyes blinked, I sat back in my office chair and
smirked for about 5 minutes.  "Wow...  Neat...  Cool..."

I've been waiting since 1981 to know who to say that too...

Anyway, I have a question that I've been mulling over from time to
time for a few decades that I thought I would never get to ask!  Here
is the background: IPCF messages flowed between Quasar, Orion
and lots of OPR programs running around.  When IPCF messages were
received in Orion, an interrupt would happen on a software channel 23.
The interrupt routine would wake up and break Orion out of a sleep so
it would go do something.

Under conditions of prolonged high system load, the GLXIPC IPCF
interrupt handler would break in a very, VERY strange way.

GLXINT kept the base of the interupt handler routines in a global
system variable called BASINT and would reference this variable to
figure out what to do when it got an interupt.  Well, when things had
been really busy for a long time this variable would get smashed!
Once it got smashed, Orion would only process messages once a minute.
Since it was responsible for sending certain responses to users, when
it wedged, a lot of IPCF space could get used up and the system would
crash once it ran out of IPCF free space.

I searched for years and I could never find out what blasted this
variable...  I tried really hard to get it, too.  I poured over
GLXINT, GLXIPC, Orion and friends and and...  Well, you can see how
well I remember this after 15+ years...

Once time, I wrote a program that CFORK%ed Orion, PMAP%ed the page
holding BASINT and then set an ADBRK% on that location for the Orion
fork.  I figured I'd get an interrupt when the code in Orion that
stomped BASINT ran and simply recorded every value and PC.

Well, guess what?  The system ran out of IPCF free space and when I
checked my program, it only caught the case where BASINT was loaded at
GLXINT initialization.  It never found the code that stomped the
value!!!  Wierd!

I never found it, so I recoded Orion not to sleep so long (1 second
instead of a minute) and to fix BASINT up if it got clobbered.  It
always annoyed me that I never found the bug...  So...  Any ideas?  I
still find myself wondering what it could be after all this time.  Who
knows, maybe if we find it, we'll be able to do XKL a favor in
advance...

Tom, I appreciate the compliments and the "digs" but there is no way I
can help you with your questions. We started working on QUASAR early in
1974. Chuck went on to work on other things sometime around 76-77 and I
moved to a new project (finally) in 1979. At that time I can assure you
that GLXLIB assembled on both operating systems :)..... ORION had just
been released and PULSAR was still under development.

Bottom line is that it is quite likely that I had nothing to do with the
code that was causing you problems and even if I did, it is "at least"
20 years ago and I make it a policy to forget any bugs that I create
after 10 years (Statute of Limitations!).

Regards/lss

The fact that it didn't assemble makes me think that he wasn't working
with a field image copy (although I never packaged anything for the
-20).  If the sources were the -10 distributon, I assure [generic]
you that things at least assembled with the conclusion that no known
errors were detected :-).

Chuckle.  IIRC, you weren't as bad as TW who forgot what he did
the day before :-))).

Yes, I'm one of the 'Everybodies'. Even brought the code to DEC in USA, but it
never made it into the mainstream.

Has anybody every duplicated EXEC's functionalty?
I did use some of Columbia University's Kermit code to implement the command
line scanner.

Barb, Larry,

We were a Tops-20 source site and had access to some Tops-10 monitor sources.
In fact, we alway built off of the standard DEC distribution base!  That
meant that whenever we got a new tape, we would have to FILCOM the new
Digital source with the old Digital source, see what the changes were and
then merge those back into our running source.	This was quite a chore,
particularly for the 4.2 Galaxy.  I cracked 300 CPU minutes in one week
assembling everything multi- tudinous times making sure I hadn't broken
anything.

I should clarify what I mean by XRMAP% broke things.  I mean that there was
no equivalent Tops-10 UUO (that I was aware of as of a 5.04 KA Monitor, the
last time I did anything under Tops-10 besides run INITIA).  We would have
NEVER sacrificed the ability to compile under both Tops-10 and Tops-20!  This
is because we had this silly feeling of being able to convince DEC to take
some of our changes and fixes.

We always kept this hope in mind.  So, yes, I used XRMAP%, but I made sure
that the Tops-10 code still compiled and still worked by using PA1050 and
verifying that the pager code would still do the right thing.

All of this was kind of silly considering Columbia didn't have a Tops-10
system anywhere on any campus.	It may have come in handy once we DECnet'ed
with Steven's.	I can't remember if they still had their DEC-10 by then or if
they ever looked at any of our stuff.  The only place were our Galaxy did
have any sort of a compatibility issue was that I changed some of the decimal
output routines in LPTSPL and GLXTXT to use the KL-10 CVTBDO instruction. 
That would have broken them on a KA.

Of course, even when I did SPR things with a FILCOM of the differences, our
changes STILL didn't make it into the sources.  Remind me to tell you about
a QSRADM time bug in I$AGE that is *still* in the sources even though I SPR'ed
it in 1983!

It's not the BASINT bug that gets me after all these years, it's the fact
that no matter *WHAT* I did, I couldn't find it.  Believe me, I used every
trick in the book!  I tried making the page that it was on be read-only and
catching all write references to the page.  I never caught a write refernce
to the BASINT offset and it was still stomped...  I used ADBRK% to catch any
write references to the field.	It *still* got stomped.  And this only
happened when the system was really loaded for a few hours...  Grr...

I'd love to know what, on Tops-20, could have blasted a field that I had so
heavily instrumented...

Uh, are you sure that address break or page protection would necessarily fire
if the store was from another user process with the page mapped (or the
monitor)?  The page may not have even *intended* to be shared; if it were
adjacent to a shared page, a fencepost error when setting up the sharing could
do it...

It was neat-o.  But common code backfired at least once.  I recall a
howling bug in DN87S.  The '10-side code would start up just fine, and
run until the first bit of data came up the wire, then -- boom!  At
the time we were running TOPS-10 on one orange box and TOPS-20 on the
other, and it only blew up on the TOPS-10 system.  I eventually
tracked it down to a byte pointer form that was undefined by the
TOPS-10 microcode.

(left-handed compliment:  I dunno what my employers thought of DN87S,
but I enjoyed it because there were just enough interesting things to
be fixed or extended.  By the time we said goodbye to our last KL, my
dirty boot-prints were all over the DN87 code on both the '10 and '11
sides of the fence.  I'd done *very* little on PDP11s and *nothing* on
communication front-ends, so I learned a lot!)

I think I owe many of the very sick things I did with MACRO later on,
to trying to figure out how GALAXY components worked and all the
techniques I learned along the way.

You can count me as one of the many souls who hacked LPTSPL.  I remember
spending Christmas week in 1980 at Fordham University groking GALAXY so I
could add a card punch spooler (yes, Fordham still _taught_ using cards) an=
d
emulating DECNET so the Lincoln Center campus RJE station could be
incorporated as a separate node as far as TOPS-20 was concerned.  

I have to confess that I have never found a batch system quite like GALAXY
since them.  A glass of wine with you, Larry!
