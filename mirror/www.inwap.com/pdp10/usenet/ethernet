Your assumption is correct.  There was a Tops-20 program that set things up so
that the front-end filesystem was accessible as device FE:, for transferring
things back and forth; I expect that something similar existed on Tops-10.

DEC didn't provide a native Ethernet controller until after the Jupiter
cancellation, when they brought out the NI-20.  This was the same as the CI-20,
with different microcode and a different network interface.  Both used up *two*
RH20 slots.

Long before DEC had an Ethernet interface, you could get a MEIS (MASSBUSS-
Ethernet Interface Subsystem) from Stanford's Computer Science Deaprtment
computer Facility, later also available from cisco Systems.  This is an
interesting device, which resided in the -11 cabinet in the KL for power, but
lived on an RH20.  Looked much like a tape device to the operating system.

The NI-20 could not listen to itself, which made loopback debugging very
difficult; the MEIS had double buffers and worked much better than the DEC
device.

I admit that I'm biased--I know the guy who designed the MEIS, and the guy who
implemented it, and used both in my days at Stanford.
