Add Rapidata to the list of SA-10 users.  IIRC, we had up to 8 systems
with IBM disks and tapes attached at the peak (after National Data Corp
brought down a few systems from a couple of their previous acquisitions
in Massachusetts to New Jersey.)  I think we started with Itel 3330 type
disks and real IBM tapes drives.  One fun story around the installation
was Stewart Nelson? making a field modification without prints to get things
going.  The systems type who told this story was almost as impressed by the
fact the SA-10 cabinet was mostly empty.

Space would definitely have been a consideration in addition to cost.

It was cost! The CalComps were only used in the old First Data facility in 
Waltham. Ann Arbor (Cyphernetics) used Memorex. Well, actually Ann Arbor also 
used CalComps after we closed the Waltham facility and moved all the systems 
to AA.

Also mostly(?) empty was the space for the SA-10 front panel. Systems Concepts 
kept promising they would produce front panels complete with indicator lights. 
In fact they actually produced a prototype which was delivered to one of the 
companies (Cyphernetics, First Data, TSL, etc.) which made up ADP's Network 
Services Division. For years it resided in the office of someone at ADP, but 
now I can't remember who's. I do recall that the owner told me it was the only 
SA-10 front panel I'd be likely to ever see. As I type this I'm thinking I'll 
email some old ADP'ers and see if I can get the straight story.

I've actually located what is probably the only extant SA-10 front panel in the 
world, currently residing in Brisbane, Oz. I've been offered a jpeg. If there's 
any interest I could post it here, even though this is not an "alt.binaries" 
group. Alternatively I could post it on my web site.

The person who owns the SA-10 front panel also owns a KA-10 front panel, which he 
used to keep in his office when he worked in the States. Whenever I visited I 
always tried to leave the switches reading 254000,,407.

I worked at Applied Logic (aka "Defies Logic") in Boston from 77 to 79.
Four of the KA10s from the old New Jersey Applied Logic (36, 71, 57, and 69)
were assembled in the old computer room of the Boston Stock Exchange at 53
State St.

The KAs were not completely stock, having been fitted with lamp test
switches and other less useful hacks. There was a large assortment of home
built hardware, like the "10-8 Channel" allowed up to 8 PDP-8s to have a DMA
channel from/to 10 memory - the straight 8's were used to serve up terminals
and the used to also connect to huge black boxes which were rumored to be 40
meg disks.

Along with two "normal" SA10s, we also had what was described by Fred Wright
(?) of SC as an "SA10A".

The SA10A was distinguished from the run of the mill SA10B by having only
two IBM selector channels, no mode for tape drives, and (here's the point) a
Front Panel.

The panel had a quaint home built appearance with about 45 lights and one
huge rotary knob, which looked like it came off of a 1950s Philco radio.
The knob was supposed to select the display for the lights.  The rest of the
panel was blank - there were no legends or descriptions.

It wasn't all that great of an enhancement. Most of the lights didn't work
at all - they may have just been burnt out. If you tried to move the knob
from the "normal" 1-o'clock setting, you would sometimes be rewarded with a
crash.  I think our hardware guy unplugged the rotary switch sometime in the
winter of 77, as its size and prominence invited random twirling by the
operations staff.

The SA10A also required some minor code hacks in the SA10 device driver
package, but I forget what they were... I think there was an FTSA10A switch
or something like that. (Hey, this was 20+ years ago.)

The SA10A was attached to System A (36/71) along with about 12 ME10s and
some TU30s which were salvaged from the First Data fire. Keeping ME10s
running was a real challenge for the hardware guys... when one of them
broke, reconfiguring was fun because a fair number of the address switches
were flaky, and some were soldered to the "1" or "0" position. System A ran
a string of Memorex RP06-style drives on the SA10A.

System B (57/69) had ME10s and 128K of Cambridge Memory and a normal SA10,
on which we ran a couple strings of the Memorex drives, a string of STC
tapes (OEM TU70s), and an IBM 1440 line printer.

Later we got a real KL10 (system 1235), all fitted with a real RP06 and two
PDP11s.  Another SA10 was acquired somehow along with a bunch of Memorex
drives and a port kit for the STC tapes. The RP06 became DSKB, the CFE ran
KLDCP, and the other 11 just sat there cause we used DCA's Smart-8s for
terminals.

I left the Boston area in 79 (returning in 86 to work in MRO1). I'm not sure
what happened to Applied Logic or the SA10-A, but it very well could have
gone to Brisbane.

Ahh, the memories.

I had a number of friends working at Defies Logic back in the late '70s, and 
visited the facility on numerous occasions. What a mess!

The SA-10 panel I've located is not in Brisbane after all, but residing in 
Conway, New Hampshire. Bob Christiansen, the owner, will be in the States this 
summer (ours) and has promised a picture when he gets to his NH place. This is 
not the Defies Logic unit (which I didn't know existed), but the one from Time 
Sharing Limited (TSL) in London. Bob wrote the front panel driver code for 
TOPS-10 and was awarded the front panel when the SA-10s were retired.

Bob will probably be surprised to find that another front panel existed. I'll 
have to try to get in touch with Ben Vaughn to see what he knows about its 
history.

System A, a stunning number of ME10s, and the ex-FDC TU30s were in one room.
The big room held the rest of A (SA10A, a couple of 10-8 channels), all of
the comm junk, and all of System B. For some reason the floor was pretty
new, and when I got there the big room was so empty in there that the
operators used to have races on roller skates and indoor hockey.

Wow, it must be a whole different beast than the one on the SA10A.  It would
have been really cool to have lights somewhere... but since the things
pretty much never broke, you didn't really need them.  Besides,
since the SA10A was so wierd and almost a prototype, I don't think its front
panel was much more than a prototype debugging tool.

That was a cool system, with the FDC TU30s showing flame marks on them, and
two big lines of ME10s facing each other.  Late at night, if I was bored or
waiting for a build or something, you could play "repeat examine next".
Since it was a dual-KA (DECsystem-1055) with 256K (a full 18 bits of
memory), you could go to the OPSER terminal, :SET RUN NO CPU1, walk over to
the slave, press HALT, examine some random location, then select REPEAT and
EXAMINE NEXT.  When the address would get to 777777 it would wrap to zero
and you would just go around and around. The ME10s would flash away,
depending on how they were interleaved. It was fun to watch.  When you are
done, just start the slave at 407 (or was it 403?), then walk over to OPSER
and :SET RUN CPU1

Hey MRO guys! Remember when the tri-SMP 10 in Marlboro (1026/1042/1322) was
running backups, the light show was just awesome? KL1026 was the TOPS-10
development system and it had about one oddball device of everything on it,
whole bunches of all kinds of disks, including a big box of Ampex memory and
two strings of TU70/72/73s.

OBTW, as far as I know 1042 was the last real 10 that ran as KL1026, in NIO.
Even though it was a KL10D (with the big tall cabs), it had 4 meg of
internal KL10E memory and a NIA20 wedged into it. Nice, tidy little package.
At the end, it had something like 4 RP06s on it. It also booted up as gidney
for the random -20 stuff.  Fitting that system would be the last one in
"Engineering". (I know, cause I shut the lights off over there.)

Oh yes Ben worked on that thing, he will remember it. Ben spent many long
nights at Defies Logic keeping that senior hardware running.

One day I came in and System B was down. Ben had diagnosed the problem as a
bad chip on the SA10. Components just plugged in to a wirewrap kinda
backplane, so it ought to be a 10 second job to plug in another chip. The
chip was something like a 16 input NAND gate. Ben looked all around trying
to find this part, which should be common enough. Unfortunately SC had the
world's supply of whatever this rare chip was.  At this time Defies Logic
wasn't paying any SC bills (not paying bills was a way of life there), and
SC wouldn't give us the chip till we had paid for a couple SA10s, the latest
Fred Wright code, and some other stuff.  Meanwhile the main revenue
producing system was DOWN. Finally, Ron wired SC the cash, SC set us a 32
cent chip, and we were back on the air.

That place was nuts, but it was also a lot of fun.

Barb, the Ampex may have been installed you left. F-S eventually supported
Ampex ARM10 memory, and the 1026/1042/1322 ran from that one box with 4 meg
in it. It had a translucent front cover with lots of lights inside.

F-S ditched the old MF10 boxes, which had labels like "S/N PROTO" and "S/N
BREAD" just after official support was obtained for Ampex.

KL1026 of that era featured RH10/DF10C and RH20s for the RP0x, DX20s talking
to RP20s and dual ported TX02/03/TU70/72/73s.  The light show was featured
on the Ampex, on the SELECT A B lights on the drives, and the TU7x drives.

Yeah I remember seeing a card punch on 1026, never mind one of every kinda
front end, ANF10 included.

Well the code was a little different for 7 track tapes, so it wasn't
unreasonable to have one (I think it was designated a TU71, but I may be
wrong).

I think that 5 CPU customer was Oak Ridge National Labs.  Five KL10s.

We also had ARM20 Ampex memory at Energy Enterprises, and it worked very
well, once you got the SBUS card timing set properly.

LCG certainly depended on having loyal customers, that's for sure.  I was
one of them... when I worked at Energy Enterprises in Denver, I had to
educate our sales droid on the entire 36 bit product line.  This wouldn't be
so bad, cause you would get a free lunch. When it came time to order stuff,
it helped if you got ahold of the real part numbers then helped the
salesdummy fill out the paperwork. (You could always call folks in Marlboro
to get those numbers.)  The problem really was that all of the good sales
people left after they had a bit of experience to work somewhere where they
were on commission.  I don't blame them, but it could be frustrating putting
up with them.

They all came with RH20s, but some idiot manager decided to make some
money bo selling the "unused" hardware.

The PDP-10s got hand-me-down disks and tapes from the IBM/MVS systems.
Fully functional disks at zero cost and the hardware maintenance guys
were already familiar with the devices.

Only the St. Louis data center inside of McDonnell Douglas had real
IBM disks.  All the others had Calcomp or Memorex plug-compatible disks.

Their billing was always "casual". In the case I mentioned, Applied Logic
never paid them a dime and yet we had three SA10s and one trip from Fred
Wright.

SC seemed to be a pretty casual company.

I think I heard something similar about them forgetting to charge Datability

You run the Tops-10 that you obtained with your PDP-10, having added the SC
mods to the sources.  You had to call SC rather than DEC/Digital for software
support if you couldn't fix it yourself; Fred Wright was pretty good.

The general thought was that you had probably executed step 1+2 (you couldn't
get the hardware without the OS, any more than you could get the OS without the
hardware) sometime in the 1970s, and wanted to go faster in the 1980s or 1990s.

>What  is an SC30?

It was SC's first model of PDP-10 clone, roughly 2.4 times as fast as a KL10 on
an average job mix.  It came with an SA channel, an MI channel (Massbuss), a CI
channel, and an EI channel (NIA-20 workalike, down to the bad design decisions)
for I/O; up to 8MW of memory, although they didn't get Tops-20 to use more than
4MW as long as I had a machine--the changes done by S** G******* were lost in a
head crash on an unbacked-up disk on their KI, and no one could re-create them.

It was technically an SC-30M, intended to be a multiprocessor box; the same
processor was used in the SC-25 (uniprocessor) and SC-20 (slowed clock uniCPU).
The SC-40 was the follow-on, with screaming floating-point.

Probably not, just some mods to KLSER if necessary--SC did a *real* KL clone,
as far as possible, unlike XKL:  They wanted old *system* software to run
without a re-compile if at all possible, so did their best to duplicate the
behaviour of a KL.

(We re-implemented the PDP-10 architecture with enhancements like hardware
support for the whole 30-bit extended address range, and changed the IO
instructions to support our backplane model and our peripherals, so we're a
PDP-10 clone rather than a KL clone.)

Nope.  System Concepts prided themselves in the fact that their machines were
bug-for-bug compatible with KLs.  You could run an unmodified TOPS-20
MONITR.EXE on their machines.  The SC30 hardware emulated having one or more
DTE interfaces.  The -10 software could speak primary and secondary protocol
to the emulated PDP-11 console front end.

Also the case at ADP. At one time we probably had the largest collection of 
SA-10s in the world, and perhaps half of them were actually paid for. We were 
convinced that whenever Mike and Stew noticed that the coffers were a little 
low they'd issue a few invoices. I think eventually things got straightened 
out, at least to the satisfaction of OUR auditors.

That wasn't always the case.  I ported SA10 support (as I recall, the code
was ISI's), and wrote FA10 support, for the SC30M during the 3 months that
I worked at SC in late summer/early fall of 1984.  The FA10 was for disks,
the SA10 was for tapes.  The FA10 went through a port selector device
called something like "IU10".

I was supposed to hack Fred Wright's TOPS-10 code and plop it into
TOPS-20.  That made no sense at all, at least not if I was going to use
PHYSIO, and I certainly wasn't going to write a standalone disk driver
that didn't use PHYSIO.

But then came up all these other problems, such as how to set up the
PHYSIO device type tables, not to mention the startup device probes (the
IU didn't like having non-existant device addresses accessed).  "You're
supposed to configure that at MONGEN time."  Right.  They were still
thinking of in the days when you rebuilt the monitor when you reconfigured
your hardware.

I ended up wiring in the parameters for the Memorex drive (essentially, an
RP06) that the prototype SC30M used.

SC was very surprised when Stanford told them "no sale unless it runs an
unmodified MONITR.EXE, including exact emulation of RH20 and NIA20".  I
don't think that SC ever sold an SC30M using SA10/FA10.

I didn't know that it was our requirement!

However, the box we took delivery of came with no MI or CI to start with, so
we had to use a spare string of single-density IBM 3380 disks for a while.  We
always used a pair of STC tape drives on the SA channel, much faster than the
TU-78s on our KLs (though all that pneumatic stuff was a bitch to keep going).
Once the MI channel was running, we started using an RP07 instead of a 3380,
and put the box into production when it could join the CFS cluster with the
success of the CI channel.

So we *did* use SA10, just not for disks in production.

Mark speaks from experience.  I realize now that I misspoke.

My statement above was based on a sale pitch we (Tymshare/McDonnel Douglas)
received while visiting the facilities.  They said they could run "your
monitor" (TOPS-10 and/or TYMCOM-X) and did not actually say "TOPS-20" to us.
But TYMCOM-X does all of its terminal I/O via DMA from a Tymnet Engine.  We
did not believe they could emulate the Engine properly in the time frame they
mentioned, and therefore did not buy any CPUs from Systems Concepts.
