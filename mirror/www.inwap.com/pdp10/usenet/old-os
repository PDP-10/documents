my first experience was with monitor was 1401 MPIO (i believe stood
for multiprogram input/output) ... it was card deck that booted into
1401 and handled the unit record spooling for 709 ibsys (card->tape,
tape->printer/punch); i.e. 709 ibsys ran fortan jobs tape<->tape.

summer job i got as undergraduate (after taking a 2hr semester intro
to programming class) was to recreate the 1401 MPIO monitor on 360/30
... so the 2540/1403 unit record gear could be switched to the 30
... and the 30 could be used for both 360 testing and still provide
front-end functions for the 709.

i designed and implemented my own interrupt handler, device drivers,
i/o supervisor, multi-tasking supervisor, error recovery, operator
interface, memory manager, etc. ,,, it had to support all of the 1401
MPIO functions ... including being able to distinquish between
bcd/ecbdic and column binary cards (i.e. had to seperately feed & read
... since if not bcd ... would have to reread in column binary) ...
was able to concurrently overlap card->tape and tape->print/punch
using dynamic buffering of all available memory on the 30.

i used a BPS loader to read monitor into 360/30 and take over all
functions of the machine. when MPIO wasn't running ... 360/30 booted
OS and was used for OS testing (and/or recompiling my program).
