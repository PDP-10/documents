I spent some time reading some of the limited docs I kept (treasures, not
for sale) trying to jog some memories loose about how to do that.

My experience is with KL10A and 6/7 pre 7.03 monitors.

There was a diagnostic on the "KLAD" disk pack that we used to format
the disks (rp04 rp06).  A copy of the "KLAD" distribution would be a good
thing to try and recover - it was a field service thing.

Having made a formatted pack you could boot the initial monitor tape.  I
have dim memories of starting the monitor and selecting a particular option
and entering the "once" dialog.  

That dialog was sort of a stand alone disk initializer that partially prepared 
(it was called "refresh") the disk.  After booting the monitor you may have
had to run a second user-level program called "twice" to do other file system 
things.  I believe the "once dialog" was used to put the bootstrap on the
disk, set up the swap file, the crash dump file, etc.

One of the documents that I still have (tops-10 7.01 update document
EY-CD139-SG-001) pulls a little more out of the old memory -

the monitor reached a "STARTUP OPTION:" prompt and you can use /HELP
there to see the "once" commands.  /STANDALONE boots in standalone :-)

You have to define a "SDL" or "system dump list" which is a series of
disks that a crash dump will try to be written to.

It doesn't sound like you are getting far enough to receive the
"STARTUP OPTION:" prompt, so you are probably not dealing with a problem
related to the initialization of "disk packs" yet.  I bet you are getting
caught by some device initialization code prior to the disks, although
it is possible that the monitor is trying to see which disks are "spun up"
prior to displaying "STARTUP OPTION:".

After once/twice you'd boot and run mongen, turn on/off various feature test
switches, assemble your monitor, put it out there and boot it!  

By the way I also have DEC-10/20 Processor Reference Manual AA-H391A-TK,
a very old copy of "PDP-10 Reference Handbook order code AIW (1969!!),
and for some bizarre reason I also kept the March 1982 CMCO software
dispatch.  I now realize I did not keep any documents for how to set up a
system!

There is a reference to "tops-10 monitor installation guide" with the
SDC number of AA-5056B-TB in the 7.01 update document.

Good luck to all emulator hackers, software distribution recoverers, and
manual recoverers!

Frankly we may need to build a monitor that meets the emulator half way.  We
can cut out vast chunks of code that support devices we would be insane to
try and emulate (and are probably causing your emulator to wig out).

No, no, no!!!  Don't use the KLAD!!!!

<snip more advice assuming too much>

What he needs to do is find a MIGnnn.MEM.  I have no idea
how he would find one.  Maybe Eric or Tim has one of them
on their disks.  What is really, really important is that
he use a MIG (Monitor Installation Guide) that _matches_

AND I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH

the monitor.  Thus if your monitor is V7.03x, then you have
to use the MIG703.MEM.  I can't remember if I won the battle
of putting this file on the Monitor Distribution Tape.

Well, it looked very strange that he typed in /TM03 but
received the "source" message that the monitor was loaded from
DSKB:SYSTEM.EXE[1,4].  That's not right.

Yes, but he can't do this yet.  That why he was asking for 
a cross-assembler.

It should be a file called MIGnnn.MEM.

Well, we went through this discussion a couple of months ago.
And I was soundly trashed by purists :-).

I don't think there is any such file there.  Or anything matching
MIG*.*, for that matter.  I've looked through the filenames, and
I've searched through the text for "Installation Guide" and haven't
turned up anything promising.

The closest we come are some of the *.BWR (Beware) files, which
did contain some updates to the printed Installation Guide notes.

The 7.04 Beware file, at

http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/pdp-10/TOPS10_704_MONITORANF_BB-X140C-SB/704.BWR

simply refers you to:

  3.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

  For normal installation, refer to the  TOPS-10  Software  Installation
  Guide.

Without a printed copy of the Installation Guide, we pretty much have
to stick to people's memories and the sources for guidance, it seems!

Tim.

Yea, there was a dependence.  When you take your break, you might
want to take a look at the MCO file that should have been shipped
on the Monitor tape.  It contains all of the publishable changes
to the monitor and we wrote an MCO for just about each and every
change.  MCO stands for Monitor Change Order.  

The filename should be something like 704.MCO or some combination
of the letters MCO and the version number of the release.

In that file, should be a description of why the change
caused these versions of BOOT and the monitor to be tied
together.  A perusal of the edit history of the file BOOT.MAC
should also give you a clue.  Tony Dzedzic would have done
most of those changes, although it might be under DPM's name.

I was not allowed to ship sources, so this is not good advice.
If there's way to do wildcarding, look for MIG70?.???.
I don't remember review a MIG704, nor do I remember arrangements
for having a Token Dummy do an installation.  Although all
of shit went on with that 7.04 release.

Sigh!  There had to be if the installation procedures 
were changed.

No, no, no.  A beware file would not have mentioned anything
about installation procedures.  I guarantee you that since
I was the one who farted around with them all.

However, it's a good point about pointing him at the beware
files...and I mean _every_ beware file.  For the CUSP tape,
I combined all of the beware files into one, CUSP.BWR, when
I redesigned the tape format into SFDs. 

>(i.e. you might find a mig700.mem in the 7.0 distribution and then
>any changes from that would be in a ???704.bwr file on the 7.04 tape)

No, NO, NOOO.  The mig700 would have no bearing on a V7.04 installation.

Things changed drastically between the ships of V7.00 and V7.04.
Think DECnet, HSCs, RP07s, TU78s, etc.

Well, we won't even tell him that all the processors gave
different results when zero was divided by zero.  Jim
"discovered" this based on an SPR.  The SPR only talked
about one processor but Jim got curious about the other
processor.  He got different results (but I don't remember
what they were :-(((  ) for a KA, KI, and KL.  The KS
didn't exist at the time.  He chuckled for a week.
