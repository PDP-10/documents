Tuesday night the Computer History Center had a lecture by
four LRL old timers about the computer hardware history of
the lab.  One of them, Bob Wyman, worked at Digital for a
while in the 60s.  He designed the DF10 data channel and RC10
controller for the RD10 fixed head Burroughs disk.

When as a college senior I interviewed at Digital in December
1967 he as PDP-10 engineering manager was the only person
outside personnel that interviewed me.  By the time I joined
the PDP-10 group the following June he had decided to leave
Digital to get a PhD from UC Davis and had given up the
group.  We hadn't seen each other since August 1968 when he
left Digital.

Among other things mentioned at the lecture were:

* A pair of PDP-6 used as the center of the Octopus each with
  256K of Digital, Lockheed, and Ampex memory with in-house
  designed and built interfaces.  They were interfaced to
  CDC-6600, CDC-3600, IBM 7030, and several IBM 7090s via an
  in-house designed and built 12-bit asynchronous interface
  that copied the CDC-3600 I/O system with point-to-point
  differential twisted pair several hundred feet long in
  cases.
* PDP-8s used as terminal concentrators for over 500 ASR-33s
* Univac
* One of two LARCs built
* One of five 7030 Stretch machines built
* 7090 with $1 per bit core memory
* Two of three IBM terabyte photo stores ever built
* The only 30,000 lpm dot matrix printer ever built
* Five Information International FR-80s producing 12 million
  line printer pages of microfiche and 3 million frames of
  graphics per month with a 24 x 7 photo lab developing the
  film

One of the stories he told was about his infamous fiasco with the Wyman Clock.

All of the computers had different ideas on the time of day.  The TOD hardware
used stepper motors driving gears and switches.  They were unreliable and the
discrepency between them was on the order of several minutes.  (On some IBM
computers, the reading of the bits from this clock/calender was done by doing
input from the lineprinter.)

Bob built a centralized source of TOD bits, and distributed them in parallel
(using individual coax cables for each bit and repeaters at each interface)
to all of the mainframe computers in the lab.  The OS of each machine was
modified to "CALL WYMAN" to get the date.

This was all fine and good until a flicker developed in one of the high-order
bits.  Each of the computers decided it was suddenly a date far in the future
and started the automatic purge of "old" files.  Oops.

	==============

On a different subject, memory back then cost $1.00 per bit.  A memory stack
of 64 Kbytes would cost $512,000.  "Memory was so precious that we couldn't
afford to store all four digits of the year, such as '1960'.  We stored just
the last two digits.  Oh, you've heard of that problem!"  (audience laughs)

Memories tend to get fuzzy with age, but I don't remember either Peter 
Conklin or David Stone being with DEC at the time the RIM10B loader was 
created. Let me throw out a few other names as possibilities: Dave Plummer, 
Don Witcraft, Dick Gruen. Dave (or RCC)?

I once had to write a 16 word program to reboot ITS
(MIT's operating system for DEC 36 bit machines)
It had to reside in some bizarre place like locations 20
through 37  (octal),  because 17 was the last AC and 40
was the first location of the UUO handler.

Well,  all I really had to do was load a one block secondary 
boot program,  but what with including a channel program,
and doing an I/O reset and all,...

Well I remember it was the tightest coding I'd ever done.

Not necessarily the best coding,  If you get my drift.

Regards,
    Dave

That was me.  You should never underestimate the feelings

produced was something very special and only those who
participated in the building (not the destruction) 
understand the depth of the tragedy that we have watched
over the last two decades.

Yup.  I remember talking until I was blue in the face about that
subject.  There were not many people who considered the notion
that the software we were developing was key to more sales;
this was during the time the KL was still fairly new.
And, in the mid 80s, when I suggested that a user should be
allowed to choose his user interface to the computer system, 
I got really weird looks.

   This, of course, is sad news; it's also old news. DEC have (or,
more to the point, the Wall Street vermin running DEC) been looking
for a buyout for at least three years.

   I'll miss DEC. They gave us some great machines and many great
moments. It's sad that they're now yet another fallen flag.

   Thanks for the PDPs, DEC - we'll miss you.

    What we produced was something very special and only those who
    participated in the building (not the destruction) understand the
    depth of the tragedy that we have watched over the last two decades.

Seems to me that the world has ceased to have interest in things that are
"very special."  The artistically and lovingly hand-crafted mainframes (and
minis, I guess) of yesterday (SAIL, ITS, etc, etc) have given way to rooms
full of identical off-the-shelf microcomputers running indentical
off-the-shelf software.

I suppose it had to happen, but it's still sad.

This goes for us old customers too.  One of the really special things
about DEC, for me, was that the team spirit of the company seemed to
encompass us, too.  We were all working *together* to make wonderful
things happen.  If I filed a well-researched SPR I knew I could expect
to be treated like a fellow developer, not a lesser being trying to
gain the attention of the gods.  If I needed something that wasn't
quite a product, I wasn't SOL.  (Anyone remember DAS79?)  I knew that
at least one salesperson out there really seemed to care whether my
company could do what it needed to do.  (Our last sales rep. still drops
in occasionally even though it's beyond the call of duty, and still
seems to know a lot about what we're doing.  I don't forget a thing like
that.)

I would certainly think so.  Too bad you can't scan them; I'd donate space on
XKL's website for the pictures.

Did Jim have a 25th Anniversary shirt?  We didn't make many of them, but I
think some of the [younger] 36-bit folks ordered them.  (Dave Braithwaite?

The *old* DEC even treated folks who weren't exactly immediate customers well.

I was a high school freshman involved in the BOCES ICC (Son of Huntington
Project) when my teacher got us an invitation to tour the Mill.

When ICC became LIRICS (Long Island Regional Instructional Computer Service)
in '71 and ordered a PDP-10, DEC kept us (the individual students) supplied
with manuals, code, advice, etc. mostly free of charge.

Later, even when things started to change,  DEC folks funeled a ton of dead
equipment our way (at one point, I had a PDP-7,8,9,15 collection, reduced now
due to space and P2C2E to a different single Straight-8) with labels that
officially made them either DEC property taken off the books or gifts or near
gifts from institutions (actually individuals) who wanted to see their
children maintained and studied rather than scrapped.

These days, (make it those days, I assume the situation is even worse now) I
can't get anyone at DEC to dig up the mechanicals for the PDP-8 desktop cradle
and module covers or the PDP-8 ECO Log fiches, even by offering money.

Now DEC folks were "smart" in building a loyal customer base, much as Apple
did by giving away all those 2es to elementary schools.

But the attitude I always got from them was the opposite of mercenary. They
actually cared that someone was interested in the beauty of the guts of their
software and hardware.

It started at the top - I remember when I made my first trip to what became
The Computer Museum Historical Collection (someone please adaquately fund this
thing and slam shut the pathetic CompUSA-style showroom TCA in Boston!) at the
MR complex, presented them with the accumulator from a PDP-5 (I got to the
owners a week too late to salvage anything more), got to play with the Bell
family's Enigma machines, etc. and, while walking across the campus ran into
KO, who I did not recognize for a full 15 minutes until after he stopped me,
told me "dont believe anything in there" (the praise to the corporation PR I
was reading) and took off down the path.

(I guess my brain was definitely not in gear that day)

But at that point, things were already changing.

There was a dual-processor KI awaiting scrapping, and the folks who owned it
wanted to donate it to LIRICS to replace the KA. Without any authority from
anyone (but knowing they'd jump at the offer) I cut a tentative deal, OK by
them, and the next day called Gerry Damm at LIRICS and told him I'd better get
the KA out of the deal when it went through.

Called my local power company and started pricing more juice for my parent's
basement.

All was set until DEC Huntington Service went crazy and said it would not take
on maintenance of the KI because it had not been under service contract since
its manufacture and had been in the hands of DEC design engineers.

A DEC in the hands of a few dedicated people interested in turning out a full
range of computers from micro to small mainframe could have survived and
prospered.

But first betting the company on a single scalable (to a degree) 16-bit
architecture, followed by a single 32-bit architecture, followed by a chip -
as well as putting profits ahead of people destroyed something beautiful -
gradually, long before the final deal went down.

Okay, here's what I remember.  DAS78 was a BiSync RJE package for
communicating with IBM mainframes and we had this too -- it later
evolved into the mainstream DN87S product (and we later had one of
those, significantly hacked by me toward the end).  DAS79 was a similar
beast but was used to RJE to Control Data systems.  My recollection is
that DAS79 never became a mainstream product, and we very likely had
the only one in existence.  Somewhere I have a brochure on it but I
can't lay hands on it right now.

(Somebody help me out -- Digital Advanced Systems later metamorphosed
into Customer Special Systems, right?  Or did I.U. just come along at
the right moment to volunteer as guinea pig for something that was
brewing anyway?)

Our sister campus in Bloomington, IN had a CDC 6600 (and later a Cyber
180) for research and an IBM 370/158 (later a 3084(?), currently an
Amdahl 5??) for administrative computing, and we had a number of
clients in Indianapolis who used them heavily.  One could send files
as card deck images, and receive print and (from the 6600) plot
output.

From some point until the RJE link to the CDC gear was removed, I had
the dubious distinction of maintaining the tables that mapped between
ASCII and CDC Display Code.  CDC was always tinkering with Display
Code and there were a dozen variants.  Since their gear was 60 bits
wide, DC bytes were six bits, and to get reasonably complete ASCII a
number of characters had to be two-byte escape sequences.

IU Bloomington had an extensive RJE network throughout the state, and
I also got to maintain the routing tables for our campus so that one
could use the 6600 as a server for remote printing.  We built somewhat
user-friendly frontend software to make complex job submission and
remote printing easier.  (One set of RJE job-preparation programs was
written in BLISS-10 -- reading that was an adventure for a relatively
junior hacker like me.)  Like Display Code, only more so, the route
table was in constant flux, and often I only became aware of changes
when someone called to ask why site X didn't work anymore or hadn't
yet been made available.

As you might expect, the DAS79 hardware was a PDP11 hooked to the DL10
adaptor.  I *think* that both DAS78 and DAS79 used the huge DS11
Multiple Line Synchronous Interface that (with its attendant '11)
occupied a complete highboy cabinet.  (At least, I have a DS11 Maintenance
Manual Vol. 1 (DEC-00-DS11-DB) and I can't imagine what else we would
have done with one.)  The DS11 was so fast, it could run up to 16 Bell
303 modems, but we only had the two lines and I think that (since they
were run by separate FE software) each must have had its own DS11.

Aside from the joys of Display Code I don't recall much about the
DAS79 -- it just ran and ran and ran.  I *do* recall one amusing thing
about our particular DAS78 setup, though -- in addition to the stock
command for job submission, some wag had added an alias to the command
table so that you could FLUSH your job to Bloomington.  (We had no
MK10 so we couldn't provide appropriate sound effects, thank
goodness!)  The stock command was something totally uncool, like
SUBMIT.  I recall one professor who was delighted to learn about the
alternative command!

If I can find the DAS79 brochure or user's manual, and there is interest,
I'll post some more.  I don't have any DAS78 material that I can
recall, alas.

<Sniped a bunch of other notes, added a bunch of random memory.>

The DAS systems and the DN (ANF-10) code were totally different.  They may have
shared the hardware, but the software was not the same.  The code base for the
DAS78 later moved to the DN60? series systems for RJE connections to the IBM
world.  The code remained totally independent.  Marlynn ??, Kalman Reti, John
Sauter (wore the same suit every day, used to sit on the floor of the lab), and
Lou ??(just cant remember any more), Bob Houk, Dana Lajoie, etc.  worked on the
DAS stuff and the "Federal" stuff, and (Early) Dave McClure, Ric Werme, myself,
(later) Todd Matson, and Bob South worked on the DN80 (ANF-10) stuff.  The
DAS/Federal group worked for Tomas Lufgren, (it later was merged with CSS from
Burroughs Plaza when they moved to MR) while the ANF folks worked for Fred
Howell, along with the entire KL Front End team (Roland Belinger, Tom Porcher,
Steve Midell (had a 924 (does it float like other volkswagens??), etc).  It
wasn't until the very early 80's that the two groups were joined, but we all
used to party together at the Gray Cape Lounge.

Ric is still around (he posts here and there every so often,) but most of the
others have gone their various ways.

DC76 code ran on the same gear, too, but it was yet another code base.

The DS11 was (IIRC) a 16 line bit banger interface, where you had exactly 1 bit
time to read the input, or the data was lost.  It was built by DAS, and was not
an option for the -11s of the day.  You had to have a -10 to get one.  The
ANF-10 driver could deal with 2 lines at 9600, Full duplex, but not three
(running on a PDP-11/10) (we had one on 514/546 in the lab on MR1-2).  One line
at 19.2 was close to the edge. If you insisted on having all 16 lines going,
then it could do 1200 baud, full duplex.  On a good day.  

If the wind was right.  

And it wasn't a full moon.

And you were swinging a rubber chicken over your head.

ANF was known for being able to drive the hardware a LOT harder than the -11
people would ever admit it could go.  I remember driving a DQ-11 (which the RSX
people said could barely do 64K/Sec) at over 400,000 bps, full duplex, with a
pair of DN87's.  If I could have gotten my hands on a shorter set of wires, it
could have gone faster.  We used to drive the DU11-s directly faster than the
special RSX COMIO/P controller could with all its fancy (and slow) microcode.
RSX said 2 DU-11s with COMIO/P at 9600 was the max, we were running three at
19.2, on the same base 11 system.  We also supported a LOT more lines that
anyone would ever want (at the time).  We actually tested this.  We made the
entire support organization use a single DN82, with 64 terminals, a line
printer, a card reader, and a fast serial line as their connection to KL1026.

Wow, does this go back to ancient history. The term "pink scheduling mode" 
was coined by Bill Cohen (I may need some help here; I know his first name 
was Bill, he was short,  and he was #2 to Larry Portner in the Programming 
Department) in 1966 or 1967, to describe a PDP-6 syndrome. Note, this was 
well before the PDP-10. As I recall the PI7 light glowed "pink" when this 
situation occurred, indicating that much too much time was being spent 
thrashing at PI7 level.

Note that this term survived into the PDP-10 era, even though the KA's lights 
were more yellow that those on the PDP-6; thus, strictly speaking, didn't 
glow pink.

In my original posting on Pink Scheduling Mode I put "pink" in quotations for 
a reason. While Bill Segal might have thought the barely glowing PI7 light on 
the PDP-6 looked pink, I never really did. In any case, "Pink Scheduling 
Mode" had a certain ring to it, and the term persisted.

Alright - That cleared up a lot.  There's still some grey areas though...

Having never seen ITS before except bits and pieces of the 1990 AI stuff,
this is a little confusing, but curiosity drives me further :)
I have all (I think...) of the binaries but no source.  I don't know how
AI was configured, so I don't know if this is useable...

I know someone with a KS-10, and we'd love to have ITS on it, but neither
of us could find it.  We already bothered MIT.
I almost had a KS, but when they said system, they meant disk packs, not
hardware.  I'd love having one, it'd go nice with my 11/44... :)

Anyway:

From the MFD:
MDNUM	Ascending dir # - Do I increment this when I add a directory, or
	is it always zero?

From the TUT:
QTUTP	 Free space pointer to track area.  Advance by cylinders.
	This is supposed to always point at the last available track?
LTIBLK	Bytes mapping the disk start here.
	How do these work?

From the UFD:

If A is relative location of MFD entry, user dir is located in track numbered
(A-2000+2*MDNUDS)/2	(See QFL2)

A is relative to what?

	UFD DESCRIPTORS:
	0=FREE, 1-UDTKMX = Take next N
	UDTKMX+1 thru UDWPH-1 = Skip N-UDTKMX and take one
	UDTWPH = Write-Place-Holder
	40 bit set = load address.  Lower 5 bits plus next NXLBYT (2)
	chars (17 bits in all)
	40 bit & 20 bit set = "Funny" block if DMDSK.  What is this, anyway?
	End by 0.
	
	What is N?  Which block the file is in?

UDSKMX	# of blocks that can be skipped
	What do they mean by that?

Other stuff:
I'm told it was DSKDMP's job to bring ITS into a running state.  How was
this done?  Did DSKDMP have a loader in the bootblock, or was it on a
paper tape?  (That makes no sense - Did a KS have paper tape?)

I have the file from info; that says how to turn the 9th floor at MIT off.
(That must have been incredibly useful!  Was it just left around, so any
random person could shut things off?)
How was the opposite done - How did ITS come up?

I generally knew the syndrome as "PI7 glow".  The scheduler runs at Priority
Interrupt level 7, which was unused by hardware, but it ran once a tick.  I
guess I forget the details or never understood them, as the scheduler was
the largest piece of the system I didn't modify much.  Basically the
system got into that state when it really needed to swap someone out to
let someone else in, but all the good candidates were stuck in I/O wait
and couldn't be swapped until the DMA completed.  Sometimes other programs
could run, but generally a disk drive or tape drive had failed (or
OS software had failed^*) and more and more programs would be stuck.
As this happened, the scheduler spent more and more time looking for
something it could do, and the PI7 indicator gradually brightened.  Sometimes
you could see the quantum steps it made.

[*]As I recall, there was race with the magtape driver that occasionally
hung a program talking to the tape drive.  It took years before that was
finally tracked down.

That was the (in)famous MTREQ goes to -2 problem, and it did take years to 
find and fix. One of the reasons it hung around so long was that it was easy 
to fix on the fly, all you had to do was poke MTREQ to -1, and the MTAs were 
unhung.

During that era I was responsible for MTASER and its multiple magtape 
controller decendent, MTXSER. At some point I'd finally had enough of the 
MTREQ hang, and dedicated myself to a 100% effort to finally put a stake 
through its heart. Since it was a particular problem on one of the 
"corporate" machines at the Parker Street (Maynard) facility, I was given 
permission to put patch traps on that system at my discretion. It took about 
two weeks to eventually track it down to a ten (or so) instruction window 
where if a magtape interrupt occurred and MTREQ was decremented during the 
interrupt, it then got decremented again upon interrupt dismissal.

I put in a CONO PI,PION/CONO PI,PIOFF pair around the window, thus solving 
the problem. This was MCO #1595. You could look it up. :-)

Don't know -- but there's a good discussion of them in

One interesting reference is "Where wizards stay up late" which details
how the first IMPs were installed.

I own a Honeywell 316, and if you have any questions I can look through
the docs.

Subject: Re: Internet History

    I recall some great war stories which appeared on this list back when
    we were all struggling to bring up Kevin Paetzold's new code with
    assorted patches and help from Bill Westfield and so many others who's
    names continue to slowly fade...

Well, thank you.  However, my contributions to tops20 internals came along
well after the "tcp/ip transition" (1/1/83) (or, looking at it another way,
the transition lasted a very long time.)

Looking back, it's amazing how early that transition was compared to other
networking "milestones."  Few places had real ethernets (and certainly not
on 20s.)  Cutting edge sites might have had some 3mb ethernet.  SRI had
"SRIIMPs" - little LSI-11s that pretended to be IMPS running NCP, while
actually communicating via (Xerox) PUP over 3Mb ethernet.  Stanford had a
lot of PUP, but I'm not sure how their 20's participated in those days.

At the time of the transition, most 20s (that spoke tcp) were running the
BBN TCP.  There were additional mini-transitions when the DEC SW and
interface (NI) came out, when DNS went in, and/or if you got a
Stanford/cisco MEIS.  My own tcp contributions happened when we noticed that
file transfers didn't go any faster of the MEIS than over the IMP, and that
trying to switch the Stanford terminal servers to tcp (for ~100 sessions per
20) didn't work very well.  These "improvements" continued pretty much up to
the time that most of the stanford 20 crew (that remained) went full-time to
cisco in 1987 or so (with occasional patches thereafter, since cisco used a
dec-20 for some time.)

How "original"?!  Anything with an 1822 interface on one side and BBN
mysteries on the other side, or do you want to talk about the differences
between 316, 516, and (uh?) C30 IMPS, TIPs and TACs, pluribus mumblefrotzes,
and the (software?) upgrades from NCP 32 bit leaders to NCP 96 bit leaders,
to TCP (and somewhere after (?) that there was DDN X.25 as a cheaper (ha?!)
alternative to 1822, and miscellaneous changes in the backbone side protocol
as well (?  Those were pretty invisible to young host programmers.)

I have a copy of BBN report 1822 somewhere.  IIRC, it has some pictures of
IMPs (pre C30), and I could try to xerox/scan and mail/email/wwwize them.

It's been a busy 20 years...

I did find my copy of BBN1822, and it does indeed have photos of 316, 516,
and Pluribus IMPS (based on Honeywell 316 and 516 minis (?) and a BBN
multiprocessor design, respectively.)  And I'll try to scan them - but
they're pretty boring looking.  (The 316 and 516 come with a teletype.  The
pluribus has a (gasp!) CRT!)

Having just worked on cisco's as5800 "access server", designed to handle two
T3s worth of dialin users (~1500 users at 56k v.90 speeds), I found the
photo of the large TIP ("pluribus TIP configuration supporting 362 users")
especially amusing.  It's about 6 full-heighr racks worth of equipment (and
this was 1978, so those are almost certainly 300bps modems.)  Cisco's box is
about 2/3 of one rack, and it not really particularly dense compared to some
of its competition (including other cisco products.)

I wonder which aspect of computing has changed most, numerically speaking.
I'd think I'd place my bets on disk space per cubic foot, but there are some
other areas that probably come close...

Greetings,

I realize that this may not be the proper forum, but like many of you,
the PDP-10 family is firmly linked in my mind with the Mill.  And though
I looked, I couldn't find any answers to my questions online.

It was only late last year that I heard that DEC had sold the Mill, and
only earlier this year that I confirmed that sad fact with DEC
representatives at a job fair (coincidentally, this was just days before
the Compaq sale was announced.)  I'd like to satisfy my curiousity and
hence the following questions:

o  When did DEC put the Mill up for sale, and when was it sold?

o  What was the official explanation given for the decision?

o  Who owns it now, and who are the current tenants?

Any other comments, references, articles that people would care to post
regarding this would be appreciated... I realize this is hardly breaking
news, but I'm thousands of miles away and haven't heard anything about
this.

Regards,

Fall of 1992.

I forget, but there were still many layoffs and whatnot going on, and
the company had more than plenty of space.  The real reason was probably
that the Mill didn't match Bob Palmer's suits.  Corporate headquarters
were in Building 12, the first piece Ken Olson rented.

While I had returned to DEC in '92, I was a contractor so couldn't go
down for a final walk through.  It would have been classy if DEC held a
open house for people who had worked in the Mill.

>o  Who owns it now, and who are the current tenants?

It was to be converted to elder housing, which struck me as rather odd
since all similar projects I'm aware of were much, much smaller.  I think
that effort failed, I don't know if anyone is in it now.  I don't
get down to Maynard often.

1973, you say?  I was under the impression that the DATE75
patches - and the general conversion to a 15-bit date format -
didn't occur until late 1974, but the appearance of a 15-bit date
format in the 1973 books means that the work began long before 
that.

Can somebody educate me about when the DATE75 issues began to 
be dealt with inside DEC?

I just checked my 1971, blue pdp10 reference handbook, second
edition, ppg 3-247 to 3-249, and there is only the reference to
the 12-bit date... so we have it bracketed (at least in terms
of when it was published).

The problem is, it costs DEC money just to *think* about stuff like this at
any "official" level, and they're certainly under no obligation to anyone
to do anything.  Considering all that, it's amazingly nice of them to have
issued hobbyist licenses at all!  So I think a bit more patience would be a
good thing, once a bunch of time has elapsed to show that DEC's sky didn't
fall as a result of the freeby licenses being written it will be easier for
them to accept the idea of allowing actual kits to float around the net.

Of course it began long before that.  It wasn't a trivial
change.  Among other things, it changed the format of the
RIBs (I can't remember if this was the cause of the invention
of the extended RIB).

The first time I encounted the phrase was when I typed up the
functional specification for the TOPS10 Notebook set.  The
spec was written by Rick Corbin.  I typed it up in RUNOFF
format in 1972.  So I suspect that the spec was shipped to
the customers as an update to the Notebook set in late '72
or early '73.  

When I began working for CS/2, DEC's internal Computer Services
group, one of my jobs was collecting the system usage data
from all the -10s used for timesharing.  One of those -10s
was System 514/546 up on ML5-5.  The system usage data was
collected in files named FACT.SYS.  There was a program 
called FACTPR.SAV that converted the mixed mode data in 
those files into SIXBIT records.  

To test all the TOPS10 software for DATE75 bugs, the TOPS10
Monitor group brought their systems up with dates of a decade 
later.  So, on the day of 11Dec1973, the system was really
brought up with a date of 11Dec1983.  There was a problem..
picture an emoticon here renewing the swearing tirades that
were produced by this problem.  1984 happened to be a leap
year (1974 was not).  Thus, when I ran the FACTPR program
on data produced after 28Feb1974, the sortable Julian dates
were wrong.  The cross billing programs who read this data
got really, really screwed up.

Another problem was that the FACT files' format also changed to
store the date in a full word.  To signify that this was a
new FACT file datum, the type code of the entry was bumped up
a bit.  For instance, a LOGIN entry of the old date format style
had the code 100, left justified in word one.  If the LOGIN entry
had the new date style, then the type code was 101.  Don Lewine
put up the LOGIN program that wrote the new data entires.  He
didn't bump the type code.  That was when I became quite proficient
editing binary mixed mode data using FILDDT.SAV.  I was _not_
allowed to mess with any code that Don Lewine wrote (and neither
was anybody else) so I got to do all that editing for a 
number of months.

I might be able to remember a few more stories but I'm all
sworn out :-).

The proper name for the caret, was the caret.  But what really happened was
that the ascii code for the caret (^) was an up arrow and it was changed!
The model 33 and 35 teletypes that we used actually did have an up-arrow,
which meant that it all matched the documentation, since in many cases the
developers of the PDP-10 used these machines to develop everything.  The
33's and 35's were also upper case only
machines, as was the LA30 (or was it 35), the original Decwriter.  The LA36
had lower case.

And remember that SHIFT-O was originally a backwards pointing arrow, then
later changed to an underscore. Thus many commands that originally looked
like:

  PIP FOO <- BAR

(where <- was a single character) ended up being typed as

  PIP FOO _ BAR

which lacks the same semantic impact.

For the terminally young, "proper" means that's how it printed on a 1964
vintage Model 35 Teletype.  This may actually be  one of the differences
between the 1962(?) and 1968(?) [I probably have the years wrong] ASCII
standards.

I remember that.  It was used in several languages available on the 10 as an

I thought no swearing was allowed :-).  IIR, backarrow was also
used in MACRO-10 as a bit shift operator.

Backarrow was also the character used to separate the input and
output phrases on a command line (it was later replace by equal
sign).  For instance, in the olden days, to copy a file from
one place to another one would type:

R PIP
FOO.OUT_FOO.IN
^C

That underscore really should be a backarrow.  I mourned the day
that character was lost because I used it to teach newbies how
to figure out which side was the output side.

Was the horrible Altmode confusion part of the ASCII spec, or was
it Teletype Corp's fault?  Originally Altmode (which had its own key,
I think it corresponds to } in the new ASCII although it may have varied)
was different from Escape (CTRL/SHIFT/K), which meant that TECO had to be

For some reason, I though Altmode corresponded with what is
now ~ (tilde).

Looking this up in the TECO-11 V40 manual, I see that we're
both right - it's a floor wax *and* a dessert topping! :

  Some older terminals may have no ESCape key, but instead
  a key labelled ALTMODE or PREFIX which sends TECO a character
  whose ASCII value is 175 or 176.  In such a case, TECO 
  will treat these characters as if they were typed in as an
  ESCape (octal 33), provided lower to upper case conversion is 
  enabled.

Note that many newer DEC terminals - those using DEC LK201
descended keyboards - don't have a proper escape key, but
that the tilde key is easily pressed into operation as a
substitute with TECO.

Ah hah!  So that's where the Hazeltine-2000 terminal (worshipped by all
us high school hackers in the mid-70s) got the idea to use tilde as the
lead-in character for cursor positioning and such!

	[Hazeltine-2000]

	    _Worshipped_?!? How? Did you sacrifice a goat to them
    daily. That's about what it took to keep those ^&%*& things
    running :-) Or maybe U.C. Berkeley just got a really bad batch.

Heh.  I do recall they had quite a bit of electronics in there.
At LIRICS, there were no PTYS available to "us", so we used to
do tricks with the "transmit screen" capability.  There was a "game"
called a can-war, where students (who all shared a PPN per school) would
try to cancel each other jobs (REALLY frowned upon if not pre-arranged!)
I wrote a macro hack that would find the other jobs logged in (there was
a UUO for this, IIRC), display it on the screen together with the CANCEL
comamnd and a "continue", start the transmit screen, and exit.  It was
a cute hack.  We lost, once, which was very impressive...

In the original ASCII specification (see CACM, August, 1963) ESC was
the position now occupied by ~ (for compatibility with an existing
Department of Defense 8-bit code), and the character now used for ESC
was S3 (one of eight information separators, S0...S7).  The other
control characters in the upper positions were ACK (now |), an
unassigned control function (now }), and DEL (still DEL).  The revision
of ASCII could have maintained compatibility with the old ESC by
leaving out a punctuation mark, and one of the proposed revisions did
work this way (see CACM, April, 1965), but in the end ESC was moved,
apparently so that non-English languages could replace punctuation with
letters and still have a contiguous range of characters assigned to the
alphabet.

There have been some really wierd terminal designs running around the
industry.  One of the odder ones was used in the HDS ("Human Designed
System") series that used the concepts of APL as its design base, including
the ability to store a latent expression that was executed whenever
the terminal was powered on.  The documentation warned about the dangers
of setting the latent expression to a string that disabled the interfaces.

I'm not sure if it used core or not; my manual for it is long gone.

Oh yes -- the documentation used the term "latent expression"; it isn't
my invention.

And for the APL-challenged readership, in an APL workspace you could
define an APL string that was executed whenever the workspace was
loaded, somewhat analogous to the "AutoOpen" macro in MS Office documents.
This was called the "latent expression".

Are you really sure, Barb?  Right around the time I left Digital (June
'95), Tim Litt (anyone remember him?) was starting an on-the-side project
to archive the then-still-online sources to TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 on CD-ROM. 
He ended up with the care and feeding of the last KL that ran as KL1026 and
as GIDNEY, depending on what color OS was desired.

As far as I know, he did get that done.

He's still in DEC/Compaq, and I bet he knows exactly where the software is.

Larry Sendlosky, who's also still there, probably has some knowledge as well.

I've been half-tempted to write a TECO FAQ, but I think
that the fact that I'm only familiar with the DEC TECO's would
quickly earn me some enemies.  ITS-derived TECO's should be
included to be fair :-).

That said, most of the DECish information that might go into a FAQ
is already on-line.  The most convenient source of information
is Pete Siemsen's DECUS tape which picks off a lot of useful
TECO stuff from previous DECUS contributions and symposium tapes; a
broken-out copy of this tape is available online
from

RCC lurks here but NEVER posts, so in his defence and to set the record 
straight; Bob had absolutely nothing to do with the RCC stopcd. After a 
spell in the Monitor Group during which he was responsible for SCNSER, Bob 
returned to PDP-10 Hardware Engineering. Don Lewine took over SCNSER support 
and decided as a "tribute" to Bob to create an RCC stopcd. I was in the 
group meeting where we kicked around possibilities and came up with "Range 
Check Chunk". While I wasn't a big fan, it was the one Don chose to 
implement.

In the vein of stopcodes named after people, wasn't stopcode WEM (which
IIRC was in the Monitor's ANF-10 code), there to "honor" William E. Matson?

What I think would be an extremely interesting document to see surface --
especially from the "folklore" viewpoint -- would be a copy of the MCO
database.  

This file, which is the recorded history of every change that went into the
Monitor that was discussed at the weekly Monitor meeting, has some of the
best examples of hacker humor I have ever encountered in my life.  

It also contains great insights into the design decisions that took place,
the tradeoffs involved, and the developers' ingenuity in solving the
problems.

It might also give people developing emulators and the like insights into
how the hardware and software _actually_ behaved, as opposed to how it was
_documented_ as behaving.

There were parallel databases -- TCOs for TOPS-20 monitor changes, GCOs for
Galaxy-10/20 changes -- that would be just as interesting from those points
of view.

I think they collectively represent a piece of PDP-10 folklore that should
be preserved.

Just my $0.02...

That's one of the items that's gone AFAICT.  Note that the MCO file
shipped on the TOPS-10 Monitor tape is _not_ the interesting file;
it was heavily edited before we shipped it.

> Let me guess: the same one is also in ITS?

If I understand what you're asking, the answer is no.

ITS is pretty different from TOPS-20 in many ways; remember, they're entirely
unrelated programs with no common code base or ancestry or anything.
(ITS is also in no way related to TOPS-10, or anything else, for that matter.)

ITS implements opcodes 40-47 as monitor calls; they all trap to location 40.
The desired system call is selected by the decoding of some combination of
the opcode, AC, and address fields in the UUO.

Originally, all system services in ITS were through UUOs.
Later, most of them were functionally replaced by a single UUO that took
a function name as its argument in a variable call block.  These new "symbolic"
system calls often had additional features lacking in the corresponding old UUOs.

For example, there was both the original .OPEN UUO and a symbolic "OPEN".  
Most code used the new symbolic OPEN call, but some old code used .OPEN.  
The old way (.OPEN UUO) took the directory name from a "user variable"
(which would have been set by another UUO), rather than passing it as
an argument in a system call block.  The new way passed the directory
name in the .CALL argument block.  (If you were opening a device that
did not have directories, you might use the old or new way, but for
disk files the new way was a clear winner.)

There was an even newer OPEN call, SOPEN, which took an ASCIZ string
or an AOBJN list of strings, so that you could have long filenames.
This was useful if you wanted to be able to open a file that lived on
some foreign operating system elsewhere on the net.  Very few programs
were written or bothered to be updated to use SOPEN instead of OPEN.

Most code used a mixture of both UUOs and the .CALL UUO.

For one thing, the .LOSE UUO was often used as the (non-skip) failure
instruction after any .CALL (system call) UUO.  There was also a .CALL
symbolic version of LOSE, and it provided more functionality.  
But the new functionality was only needed when implementing fancy
error-handling routines, so people would just write a .LOSE instead.

There were some UUOs that did not have symbolic counterparts and vice versa.

Nobody really used micro-tapes by the time of the symbolic calls regime,
so there was no symbolic version of .UINIT or .UBLAT.  There was no
need to make a symbolic version of the .SWAP UUO whose purpose was to
invoke a debugging test of the system's swapping routine.  
On the other hand, the scheduling UUOs .SLEEP and .HANG were commonly
used in programs, and there was just no symbolic counterpart for them.

Here's some typical code to read in a file directory:

Background: file names in ITS are sixbit and have four parts: device,
directory, filename1 and filename2, such as "DSK:CSTACY;INDEX HTML".
That's a whole 'nother story.  Also, directories are not hierarchical.
Anyway, to read a directory, open the magic file named ".FILE. (DIR)".

OPENER:	.CALL [	SETZ ? SIXBIT/OPEN/
		[.BII,,INCHAN]
		[SIXBIT/DSK/]
		[SIXBIT/.FILE./]
		[SIXBIT/(DIR)/]
		SETZ SNAME]			;SNAME has name of the directory.
	 .LOSE %LSFIL
READIT:	MOVE TT,[-2000,,DIR]			;1K will be read into DIR
	.IOT INCHAN,TT
	.CLOSE INCHAN,

Usually people wrote some standard macro for doing .CALLs, like this:

DEFINE SYSCAL OPER,ARGS
	.CALL [SETZ ? SIXBIT /OPER/ ? ARGS ((SETZ))]
TERMIN

Note the use of .IOT in the previous code fragment, 
even though they could have written it all this way:

READIT:	MOVE T,[444400,,DIR]			;BP to where to read.
	MOVEI TT,2000				;All dirs fit in 1K.
	SYSCAL SIOT,[%CLIMM,,INCHAN ? T ? TT]
	  .LOSE %LSFIL
	.CLOSE INCHAN,


Cheers,
Chris

I am the one-person customer advocacy department at XKL (provides all of sales
support, pre-sales customer support, and post-sales technical support) as well
as the senior systems administrator (a recent addition to my responsibilities).
I think that qualifies me as a reader who works for XKL! ;->

We licensed the sources for all 36-bit products and diagnostics from Digital
(after a long series of false starts in which those with whom we negotiated
often stopped having anything to do with the 36-bit world) through the Office
of Technology Licensing (I think that was the name; it's not on any of the
correspondence in my files).  I have not heard anything from our contact there
since before the Compaq take-over.

However, we licensed these products for the purpose of providing them to our
hardware customers, and the contracts we signed with Digital reflect that:  We
can provide anything needed to someone who has purchased an XKL Toad-1 system,
but we cannot provide sources or binaries to anyone who has not.

Congratulations!  Er... or, my condolances, whichever you prefer ;)  Quite a

Ah, I see. However, this at least tells us that if one is interested
enough in taking on the herculean task of tracking down the right
contact at Digital, and coordinating with you fellows, and arranging
the legal stuff, then he might THEORETICALLY be able to obtain
permission and licenses to obtain the actual physical distribution.

At least this is significantly better than hearing "No, noone has any 
contact with 36-bit stuff anymore, and noone has any idea where to
find it.  We think Compaq burned it all in a dumpster somewhere."

The Stevens VM/TS KL1282 running TOPS-10 that others have mentioned was a
dual-controller system: DTA0: through DTA3: and DTB0: through DTB3:.  Six
tapes could be seeking and two could be doing I/O simultaneously.  The DECtape
hardware (controllers and tape units) came from Stevens T/S KA101 and I don't
recall hearing about any special hardware to interface them to the KL.

Saying that TOPS-20 "never completely embraced the Internet" is somewhat
like saying Darwin never completely embraced the theory of evolution.

The original implementations of the TCP/IP protocol and the basic
applications (DNS, TELNET, FTP, SMTP, POP, IMAP, etc.) were developed on
TOPS-20 (and Tenex, the immediate precessor to TOPS-20).  I confess to
have written some of these, on TOPS-20 and on other PDP-10 operating
systems.  UNIX was very much a johnny-come-lately.

For a long time, the root DNS servers were all TOPS-20, because BIND
at that time wasn't up to the task.

The command interface of UNIX telnet and ftp was copied from the TOPS-20
programs.  Not very well, though; it's enough to look bizarre to a UNIX
hacker yet it omits all the benefits of that interface.

And, goddamn it, I *hate* brain-damaged UNIX sockets and the piece of
garbage C library resolver routines!!  How I miss the ability to redirect
standard input/output to a TCP filespec on the command line (I can't
believe that UNIX geeks haven't hacked this into the shell yet) not to
mention the wonderful Chives resolver.

TOPS-20 died a slow and agonizing death *because* it was so net-friendly.  
It would have vanished in a flash otherwise, given the determined efforts
of its sole vendor to kill it.

> Have you completely forgotten SIMTEL20 :-)?

Thanks for the memories, Tim.  I had something to do with that system
too...  ;-)

Yup.  I'm rather amazed to see announcements of "newly developed
techniques" that were well-known to us old farts of the 1970s.

For all intents and purposes, there was only one vendor of TOPS-20 and the
PDP-10 hardware which ran it (Foonly and SC don't count).  In order to
promote its other product line (the VAX), that vendor did its damnedest
for several years prior to 1983 to discourage people from buying PDP-10
systems in the hope that customers would give up on it on their own.  When
that failed, the vendor killed the entire PDP-10 product line in 1983.

Nonetheless, it still took *years* for the PDP-10 to die.  PDP-10 systems
remained the center of the Internet until the late 1980s.  There was a
*huge* resistance against moving to VMS (stab me in the back one, shame on
you; stab me in the back twice, shame on me); but there was an equal
reluctance to move to UNIX.  In the end, UNIX won because it was the
only game in town; it wasn't VMS, and it had enough features that it could
be made tolerable.

There were new user tutorials, quick references, FAQs, etc.  Most of this
has been destroyed.

Nothing could have been further from the truth.

One of the excuses given for getting rid of PDP-10 systems was that they
encouraged too many students to hack instead of doing their classwork.

Yes.  On the one hand, it's normal for people to clean out what they no
longer need.  On the other hand, there was an aggressive effort to toss
out anything that could have reminded people that there was once something
better.

That's right.  I know all about that behavior.  I wrote the standard
implementations of Telnet for ITS, SAIL, and TOPS-20 successively; and my
Telnets had that interface.

    >Saying that TOPS-20 "never completely embraced the Internet" is somewhat
    >like saying Darwin never completely embraced the theory of evolution.

    Yes, I understand that (from reading some of the older RFCs).

    But I still think there's a difference in philosophy, especially
    concerning the distribution of programs and information.  If TOPS-20
    really used the 'net to its advantage, shouldn't we see lots of software
    and documentation around?  (I realize the OS itself was never
    redistributed, of course.)  Now it's possible that the documentation was
    so good that there was no need for any "new user" tutorials, quick
    references, FAQs, etc.  It's also possible that the philosophy of the
    Internet went against distributing information that everyone knew, or it
    was distributed but has since been erased, or I'm just not looking in
    the right place.

All of this is true.  The non-funded use of the arpanet WAS kept "low
profile".  The actual NUMBER of applications was small, and users were
typically TAUGHT to use them in classes.  In addition, you have to
remember that there were several orders of magnitudes FEWER tops users
than there are currently mac or windows or even amiga users.  Computing
was DIFFERENT in those days.  You also need to understand that TOPS died
well before those orders of magnitudes worth of people showed up, and
LONG before "Internet" became a household word (Let's see.  The DEC 36
bit line was canceled in 83 with a 10-year "migration" plan.  The first
MAC came out in 84.  Cisco started selling internet stuff about 87, but
hardly anyone knew what it was.  Clinton/Gore were elected in 92, and
helped push the internet along.  I don't recall exactly when "commercial
use" of the internet became acceptable - I was too busy writing code.
Windows-95 included tcp/ip support, but the browser wars started well
after that.  So, "the web" as we know it is no more than 5 years old,
and came about AFTER TOPS was gone (except for fanatics.)

Note that simtel-20 pretty much ran on freeware (as well as distributing
it.)  Mail system by Crispin at stanford, X/YModem by Westfield at SRI,
choice of assorted FTP and FTP Servers, Operating system hacks by people
all over.


    And they may relegate games to "after hours" unofficial programming.
    The same may have been true of TOPS at MIT, Stanford, etc.

Mainframe mentality, common wherever resources are more limitted than
"all uses" would need.  You can still see this today in anyplace with
less than one computer per user, or over network resources.


    DECWARS?  The version of SITBOL that someone wanted?  It's all just
    *gone*, as far as I can tell.

Yep, probably.  More accurately, it's probably sitting on a bunch of 9track
magtapes that would cost more to get read than it's worth.  OTOH, I have
email archives that go back to about 1980 and are still readable (using the
same mail system I use for todays mail.)  Part of that is always having had
"friendly" job changes, so that I could take things with me.  I've got most
of tops20 on a mac disk, too.  Don't tell Compaq.


    Wasn't the Ctrl-] character originally Ctrl-^?  (I'm thinking of "The
    Telnet Song" here.)  Actually, the behavior in the song doesn't seem to
    work these days.

Ctrl-^ on most 36bit systems.  Unix had to be different.  It's still ctrl-^
on cisco gear, and the song still works...


    >Yup.  I'm rather amazed to see announcements of "newly developed
    >techniques" that were well-known to us old farts of the 1970s.

    You would think that with all the fundamental developments in the 70's,
    when people finally started to understand compilers, operating systems,
    software architecture, how to build good systems that work together as
    systems, debuggers, object-oriented programming, and a bunch of other
    stuff, that our software would be vastly better.  Unfortunately it's
    almost worse.  That's the main reason I don't like the direction that
    research and the industry are going in.

IMHO, nearly ALL of the effort since then has gone into improving usability
by "the masses."  That way, you can sell MORE computers.  If you implement
it badly enough, to can sell the same people a NEW computer every couple of
years, cause their old one won't be big or fast I.  I am unable to resolve
whether I believe this is a good thing or not. :-(

(The flip side of this is that many of the "important issues" from those
days just AREN'T any more.  I mean, I worked on the stanford newswire
software that packed some of its data storage files into 5bit bytes so that
they could fit 7 characters in a word and conserve disk space.  Stuff that
used to need fancy database algorithms (say, finding a particular email in
a 40 MByte archive) can now be done faster using a linear text searchs.)

Prof. Knuth is among the truly elite, those who, by choice, are *not* at
the beck and call of anyone who can figure out an email address.  Even in
the early 1980s, email for him went to his secretary unless you knew the
secret alias that was his real mailbox.

I envy and admire his bold pioneering spirit.  I intend to undertake that
step myself someday.

His explanation included, roughly, "Email is great for keeping on top
of things; I like to get to the bottom of things." My understanding is
that he just wants to work on his books with no interruptions, and
figures that important messages will get through. See his Web page at
<http://www-cs-faculty.Stanford.EDU/~knuth/index.html> for the real
story.

The IMAP protocol is the direct descendant of MM, and Pine can justly be
called MM's successor.  MM was an outstanding program in its day, but

    TOPS-20 (and Tenex, the immediate precessor to TOPS-20).  I confess to
    have written some of these, on TOPS-20 and on other PDP-10 operating
    systems.  UNIX was very much a johnny-come-lately.
								-- MRC

Excuse me!?! I ran a network UNIX for the Berkeley Speech Research group,
one of only three or four UNIX systems on the 'Net at that time.  And
that was with a VDH interface, no less!  [Hint: That was before BSD meant
anything...]  Why hack an '11?  Heck, i wanted access to/from the PDP-10 
at Stanford!!   Now i won't disagree with you about modern networking;  
if anything, i continue to be surprised how little UNIX has chanced since
1975 when i wrote its first pseudo-teletype driver (patterned off the
SAIL version, of course).  And, yes, that lowly PDP-11/40 ran EDDT.  Do
you think i wanted to deal with 'core' files??  And the attached GT40 had
Spacewar as well (ableit it *really* needed button boxes).  I don't know
how many times i replaced the darn deflection transistors on that thing.

Of course, UNIX went somewhere else from there;  but apparently 'pty.c' 
survives to this day in various forms.  I recognized it a dozen years
later on a Symbolics distribution tape for UNIX support, by the MACRO-10/
FAIL style comments in it!

Don't forget the "tenex" command built into some FTP clients.
It was needed to interface 8-bit computers (CP/M, MS-DOS, PDP-11, UNIX)
with 36-bit ones (TOPS-10/TOPS-20/TENEX).

When an 8-bit binary file is stored on a TOPS-20 system with a file
byte size of 8, then four bytes are stored per word on the -20, and the
remaining 4 bits in the 36-bit word are wasted.

In BINARY mode, the TOPS-20 FTP server would send or receive a stream of
bits.  This meant that four and a half bytes would be stored the the first
36-bit word, and the second 36-bit word would have the second half-byte
and four more for a total of nine bytes (72 bits) per two 36-bit words.

The 'tenex' command built into 8-bit oriented FTP clients tells the
remote TOPS-20 FTP server to switch to 8-bit mode, overriding the 36-bit
byte size in the remote file's info block.

I've also seen a TENEX.COM program; it was used to recover data when you
FTPed a file from a TENEX/TOPS-20 system and forgot to use the 'tenex'
command on the client side.  It would read the partially corrupted file
nine bytes at a time, clean them up, and write eight bytes at a time to
the output file.

the days before we (DEC) got "professional" with documentation.
We had a section in the Notebooks that contained the internal
specs; I don't know if those specs got shipped in bits way
back then--I suspect they did.  One of my ongoing battles was
getting useful documentation shipped on our tapes and eliminating
worthless bits.  I ususally lost in both aspects.

I don't see an entry for STORS, a PDP-10 used by Storage Systems in the Mill.
And I *still* don't see an entry for MRFORT.

However, since 2263 was Orange Blossom, I figure it had to run Tops-20; the
list didn't know that until now.

I had accounts on KL2263, and KL1031, they were really nice systems.
Then the accounts moved to the lame Barnum and Bailey 11/780 VAX Cluster.
System Admin could never figure out how to tune the Cluster, it was
always going down. I missed the KL's.

Nope.  That was the system the TOPS10 monitor group used.
My first encounter was on 3-5 and was later moved to 5-5.

>  28	TOPS-10	DEC (then, a customer)	Maynard, MA	KA10

I don't remember this system at all.

Nope.  This was the system that CS/2 had; it was the timesharing
system for the rest of DEC and was in 5-B.  Later it got transfered 
to the TOPS10 monitor group when CS/2 got their KI.  The systems 2
and 40 were combined for the dual KA test bed for the -10 monitor
group in Marlboro.

I don't remember these two machines.

> 514	TOPS-10 Development		DEC, Marlboro	KI10
> 546	TOPS-10 Development		DEC, Marlboro	KI10

These two machines belonged to the -10 monitor group and were used
for the KI dual processor development and testing in Maynard 5-5.

Sarr, would I count among those "other folks"? Actually I spent my entire 
time at ADP Network Services in Management, so never delved into the guts of 
the Communications KA-10s ("CKAs", later "CKIs").

Because of the nature of Cyphernetics' (acquired by ADP to become the kernal 
of ADPNS) business, many of the problems later solved in more "standard" 
ways by the telecommunications industry were addressed in unique ways. The 
need for bridge/routers was solved by using KA-10s as "front ends" to the 
timesharing systems through shared memory interfaces. Using Cyphernetics' 
proprietary peer-to-peer protocol, the CKAs were treated as just another 
node on the network. All remote communication found it's way to the "central 
systems" through the CKAs. A serendipitous by-product was a very high speed 
path between central systems.

Nick Carter (probably the best programmer I ever worked with) took advantage 
of this capability by creating a system (and set of protocols that pre-dates 
ftp) called MOVER that became the basis for all intersystem file exchanges. 
Within a very short time MOVER became an integral and essential component of 
the company's ability to conduct business. All software distribution and 
accounting data collection was done via MOVER. At its zenith ADPNS was 
supporting something like 30+ KI and/or KL central systems at three data 
centers (Ann Arbor, MI; Waltham, MA; and London, UK) and something like 100 
KS-10 based, remotely operated "ADP/Onsites". I think we were even 
supporting a pair of remote KIs at Jaguar at one time.

To paraphrase something I came across recently, "Everything in computing was 
invented in the '60s."

Well, now I know who to thank for the useful stuff that *did* get
out.  We customers appreciated very much being let in on what was
really happening inside our systems and how to use them effectively.
Other vendors may hold other opinions, though, because you trained a
lot of us to expect that kind of treatment and they hate and fear us
too much to give it.

Now that I've had time to recollect, I think I did see LEVELD.MEM.  I
didn't think it remarkable at the time, though, because 5.something
was the first TOPS-10 version I ever saw and, by the time I found the
.MEM, I'd already been trained to think such things were normal and
expected.  (Of course, things like having enough ACs to dedicate some
to particular uses meant another kind of culture shock when I was
forced to deal with microprocessors....)

Here is a story sent to me by  RDH.  CDO in my SMP story
wrote a FORTRAN program that took the SYSDPY data
and did something with it.  If somebody could give
CDO a kick or two to describe what he did, I'll be able
to include it in my final copy of the story.

[Begin RDH story]

I pretty clearly recall talking with JMF about 1+1 ranging from 0.95
to roughly 2.3 (man was he *proud* of that 2.3!). What do you want me
to prove, I can write a benchmark to display it . . .

Also, I think this was after Jim spent all those hours staring at
SYSDPY output, but I put a lot of effort into enhancing SYSDPY's
output, cramming a lot of info into a mere 24x40 display (the other
24x40 was reserved for *jobs* -- SYSDPY's forte, after all). I still
remember "discovering" that the KL had this perf board -- an ENTIRE PC
BOARD dedicated to just measuring things. And noone seemed to know
about it, let alone use it for something! Mine! All Mine! Remember
SYSDPY with all those RH20 channels and PI usages columns . . .  (I
was like a kid in a candy store!) That got me on a roll, and I kept
pestering those guys (the Jim and Tony show!) to give me numbers. Disk
blocks transferred. Paging calls. Since I was at least semi-defacto
owner of SCNSER by then, I "was free" to put in my own tty numbers;
ditto NETSER and network numbers. I still remember Tony's
not-quite-sure-what-to-do-with-me looks when I would pester him for
per-disk str numbers "so I can display them".  I eventually won him
over. He liked it, even! (HIGH praise, then, fer sur!).

I remember my first introduction to Jim. I was still very new then
(probably just a months or two...), and I was absolutely revelling in
the ability to just walk into the lab and pull down a honest-to-god
real-life SOURCE LISTING and just read it. Like I belonged, there,
even! Anyway, there I was, poring over lines of cabalist ritual, and I
came across this "CONO P1,PIOFF" instruction. Duh??? I spent *ages*
looking at that instruction, going back to the hardware reference
manual, back to the listing, back and forth. I finally gave up in
utter frustration and defeat: I just don't understand what this
instruction is supposed to do.  I asked Mike Gilbert about it, and he
couldn't figure it out either, so as Jim walked by, he asked him about
it. Jim glanced at it, pulled his pencil out, and scrawled in a "PI"
for the "P1", tagged the listing with one of those ever-present cards,
and went on about his business. Wow! MY FIRST MONITOR BUG, found just
by inspection . . . (Well, OK, in a previous life as a starving college
student, I found a fair amount of interesting system bugs...but this
was different.)

Yup.  That improved somewhat after I started making him eat 
vegetables but his lack of motor control never really went 
away.  At least he wrote large letters...unlike Kalman.
