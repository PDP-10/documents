Yes to one.  No to two.  However, I would hardly call it a DECsystem-10.
It is 10 architecture hardware running on a custom opsys which has
as an ancestor a very very early version of TOPS-10.

No.  CSNI (Compu-Serv Network Incorporated, their name at the time)
had a Tuscon facility which was building a 10-look-alike.  It was
cancelled before it could be completed.  It was cancelled before
the Jupiter.

C$ now uses Systems Concepts' 10 look-alikes, I think.  I left a long
time ago but that is what I think I heard from friends who now run much 
of the company.

This is correct:  Mike Leavitt and Stewart Nelson of SC could not manufacturer
their boxes fast enough to satisfy the demand from CIS, so they licensed the
design for a hefty (40% of purchase price) fee for each one CIS built.

However, CIS stopped using any PDP-10 architecture in December 1996, laying off
all but one of their PDP-10 systems personnel to force a move to NT that had
been "lagging" (from a management perspective) for a long time.

This is covered in the Jargon file, under "Mars".  Nothing there about
CIS buying a license, though:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
:Mars: n.  A legendary tragic failure, the archetypal Hacker
   Dream Gone Wrong.  Mars was the code name for a family of PDP-10
   compatible computers built by Systems Concepts (now, The SC Group):
   the multi-processor SC-30M, the small uniprocessor SC-25M, and the
   never-built superprocessor SC-40M.  These machines were marvels of
   engineering design; although not much slower than the unique
   {Foonly} F-1, they were physically smaller and consumed less
   power than the much slower DEC KS10 or Foonly F-2, F-3, or F-4
   machines.  They were also completely compatible with the DEC KL10,
   and ran all KL10 binaries (including the operating system) with no
   modifications at about 2--3 times faster than a KL10.

   When DEC cancelled the Jupiter project in 1983, Systems Concepts
   should have made a bundle selling their machine into shops with a
   lot of software investment in PDP-10s, and in fact their spring
   1984 announcement generated a great deal of excitement in the
   PDP-10 world.  TOPS-10 was running on the Mars by the summer of
   1984, and TOPS-20 by early fall.  Unfortunately, the hackers
   running Systems Concepts were much better at designing machines
   than at mass producing or selling them; the company allowed itself
   to be sidetracked by a bout of perfectionism into continually
   improving the design, and lost credibility as delivery dates
   continued to slip.  They also overpriced the product ridiculously;
   they believed they were competing with the KL10 and VAX 8600 and
   failed to reckon with the likes of Sun Microsystems and other
   hungry startups building workstations with power comparable to the
   KL10 at a fraction of the price.  By the time SC shipped the first
   SC-30M to Stanford in late 1985, most customers had already made
   the traumatic decision to abandon the PDP-10, usually for VMS or
   Unix boxes.  Most of the Mars computers built ended up being
   purchased by CompuServe.

   This tale and the related saga of {Foonly} hold a lesson for
   hackers: if you want to play in the {Real World}, you need to
   learn Real World moves.

Compuserve did a lot of PDP10 hacking, and it would not surprise me if
they had licensed the design from SC as Rich Stated (and Rich was intimately
involved with Stanford's SC30, so he might know!)

My favorite hack was replacing the linear power supplies in the (dec) KL-10
with modern switching power supply technology.  That changed the efficiency
from ~30% to ~85% or so, saving enough $$$ in power and airconditioning to
buy surplussed CPUs every couple of months...

Mostly just wanted to note that the SC-40 (not "M", which was the designation
for a never-delivered multiprocessor configuration) was eventually delivered,
in 1993.  Compuserve built those once they were available.

The model numbers at SC were SC-30M (a 5ft x 30in x 30in cabinet with LOTS of
empty space inside), the prototype to which was delivered to LOTS the day
before Hallowe'en, 1985*; the SC-25, which was the SC-30M processor in a BA23
cabinet; the SC-20 which was an SC-25 with the clock speed cut in half; and the
SC-40, which was much faster than the SC-30M.

I tried to buy an SC-20 for cisco Systems when I worked there briefly (1993);
Mike wouldn't even send me a quote because he was afraid that the box would end
up in Len's hands--even though Len parted ways with cisco in 1990.  We settled
for storing a KL with Bruce Kennard.

*I still have pictures, of Ralph Gorin in costume, of me next to the beast, and

Thanks, the Jargon File entry had the tone of describing a long-gone
organization; it had not occurred to me that they might still exist.
A bit of web searching turns up <http://www.scgroup.com/>, though.
They're still selling the SC-40.  Maybe....  There's a description
of the SC-40 at <http://www.scgroup.com/sc40.html>, which seems
to be their only product, and their home page says "Our SC-40 is
still very much alive".  They also apparently still provide TOPS-10
updates (though you need a password to get at them), and they seem 
to think that CIS still uses their hardware.

Exploring their web pages does give the impression that Sumo wrestling
is their primary interest these days.

Compu$erve stopped using KL-10's running their highly modified version of 4S72
about 10 years ago, when they ported the OS to the Systems Concepts SC-25 (and
later SC-40) clone.  They got rid of all the KL's then.  (NB:  They never ran
Tops-20.)

About 5 years ago, they decided to move their business to Windows NT servers.
This appears to have killed them, or at least weakened them to the point that
AOL eventually bought Compuserve Information Services.

Compuserve Networking Services (a different part of the whole business) went
instead to WorldCom.  They were trying to get off their few remaining SC boxes
a while back...

Computer Corporation of America (http://www.cca-int.com/) still
lists 1032.  I think but am not sure Compuserve held onto 1022
when it sold 1032 to CCA since the PDP-10 based software was
built around 1022.  If my memory is correct, I guess that means
AOL has the rights now.  A check with CCA might be in order.

The license check was very tricky with code scattered all over
the place.  I forget what it was even looking for other than
date so just changing the date won't be enough.

I may even have a manual buried in a box somewhere.  I think it
was also included on the distribution tape which would be
better than trying to scan it.

PS	That reminds me.  The folks in RI might want to see if
	they can score a power supply for the KL from what
	is left of Compuserve.  Much less power hungry and
	gives off less heat.  They sold a few to other sites
	as well but couldn't quite work out a deal with DEC.
	Probably not enough to keep it running full time but
	maybe more often than with the original unit.

You're both right:  The Compuserve OS spun off from Tops-10 v. 4 (I think 4S72)
and went its own way.  Most of this was done with "negative CALLI's", that is,
system calls whose selector value had bit 18 set; the WAITS operating system at
Stanford AI Lab did the same sort of thing to a v. 3 monitor.

In addition to the OS mods, the CIS folks changed the microcode to get a larger
address space (unrelated to KL "extended addressing").
