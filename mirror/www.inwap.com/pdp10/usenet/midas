The MIDAS that ran on ITS (and thus was used to compile ITS) is not the
same as the MIDAS that ran on TOPS-10 and TOPS-20.  I don't think that
anyone has ever compiled ITS on a TOPS-20 system before.  Don't forget
that there are completely different system called used for I/O, different
basic symbol table entries, etc.

To increase MIDAS' stack size, change the definition of LPDL:

IFNDEF LPDL,LPDL==1500.		;LENGTH OF PDL

Try 2000. or 2500.  Note that the trailing period is MIDAS' way of saying
decimal; e.g. ^D1500 in MACRO.

[BAH]
Yes, yes.  But he was using MACRO to assemble it.  When
people wrote assembler, they usually made enough stack to
get past the assembly stage.  Or was there
a very different assembler for ITS, too?

[J_Sauter]
As I read the original post, Daniel is attempting to
use the MIDAS assembler on TOPS-20 to assemble NSALV.  
He is not using the MACRO assembler at all.

...

[BAH]
The reason I'm questioning this in the first place is to
verify that an emulator bug hasn't been tripped over.
It should be at that phase where all the obscure nits
are going to show up.

[J_Sauter]
Possibly the version of MIDAS that runs on TOPS-20
was not intended for something as large as NSALV.
I imagine that the distributors of MIDAS felt that
_real_ programming would be done using ITS.

No, he was using MIDAS.  There is not a snowball's chance in hell of
getting ITS to assemble with MACRO.

The stack overflow happened in the assembler and was reported by the
assembler.  It happened because he used TOPS-20 MIDAS to assemble ITS,
something that nobody had ever done before.  ITS was always assembled with
ITS MIDAS, in the ITS environment.

Note that ITS sources have a label "RESET" which is a perfectly valid
label on an operating system which doesn't have a "RESET" system call.

Frankly, I'm surprised that the assembly even got as far as it did.

Yes.  ITS was built with MIDAS.  WAITS was built with FAIL.  Both of these
were quite superior to MACRO.
