I just found the following post from Sept. 2002 from Tim Shoppa:
"The RT-11 Historical Overview states:

  The year 1971 was an exciting time...A popular operating system
  for the PDP-8, called OS/8, was the design model for the new PDP-11
  operating system, tentatively called OS-11...

  ...in the fall of 1972...the groundwork was laid to make OS-11
  compatible with OS/8 and TOPS-10...

  OS-11 was renamed first to RTPS-11 (Real-Time Programming System),
  then to RT-11 (Real Time).  Version 1 of RT-11 was completed in the
  fall of 1973."

I've got a book here which says:

OS-11		1972
RT11 V1		1973
RT11 V2		1974
RT11 V2C	1976
RT11 V3		1977
RT11 V5.1	1984
RT11 V5.2	1985
RT11 V5.3	1986
RT11 V5.4	1987

I seem to recall some discussions of an "OS-11" code name inside DEC
fpr RT11, which was initially often thought of and spoken of as
"OS-8 with the interrupts on".

DOS-11 existed from the earliest pdp11s,  starting maybe 1971 or so
and by 1976 it was up to V10, used a variant of the RSX11D taskbuilder
as its linker, and had a fair bit of software in the DECUS library to
do interesting stuff with it. It was used to boot early RSTS and some 
other pdp11 OSs and its internals had somewhat in common with RSX11C and 
later RSX11B. (RSX11A was an entirely different animal.)
The main problem DOS had was that it used .read and .write calls for 
most of its I/O. While its low level I/O was reasonably fast, .read and 
.write did at least scores if not hundreds of instructions per byte in 
formatting and checking for all the funny options those services had. As 
a result when RT11 came along, and had apps do their own I/O, it looked 
blindingly faster. A decent record system in DOS would of course have 
equalized this.

I sometimes think of RMS when recalling this.
