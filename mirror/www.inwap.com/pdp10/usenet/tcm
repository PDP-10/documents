 I've just seen the recent messages on alt.sys.pdp10 and a few on 
 alt.folklore.computers about The Computer Museum (TCM) in Boston, their 
 collection activities, plans, etc.  I'd like to respond.  I'm sorry for 
 the length of this message, but it's important.
 
 First:  I'm not an employee of TCM, just a volunteer.  I joined the 
 Board of Overseers of the museum a few months ago specifically to help 
 them start a project for a west coast computer history center and 
 museum, which I'll talk about in a while.  I was motivated to do this 
 by teaching a graduate EE/CS course in computer architecture at 
 Stanford, and it suddently struck me as outrageous that there was no 
 place for my students to see the machines built out of the 
 show-and-tell items I was bringing in: vacuum tube modules, core 
 memories, etc.   I've been in the business for a while.  I wrote my 
 first computer program in 1963 for an IBM 650.
 
 As a result of that epiphany while teaching I went both to the 
 Smithsonian and to TCM to see what they were about and was 
 disappointed, to an extent, to see that much of their apparent charter 
 is educating schoolkids about current computer technology.  That's good 
 stuff, but not want I wanted to see.
 
 Eventually I spoke to Gwen and Gordon Bell, who, with Ken Olsen, 
 started TCM back when it was inside DEC and was much more historical. 
 I was delighted to discover that they, too, were interested in 
 re-establishing the historical display, and even to do it in Silicon 
 Valley, which cinched my participation because I now live and work 
 here.
 
 TCM's facility in Boston evolved to what it is in part because it 
 needed to become financially self-sufficient after leaving the DEC 
 womb.  They get 150,000 paying visitors a year and corporate grants for 
 educating children.  They would simply not have survived, a decade ago, 
 had they kept the historical focus.
 
 But the times have changed, or so we're hoping.  More people, as 
 evidenced in part by the traffic on a.f.c and a.sys.pdp10, are 
 concerned about preserving the history of computers.  Other recent 
 organizations, like Kip Crosby's Computer History Association of 
 California (CHAC) are lobbying for the same ends.  There *may* now be 
 enough individual and corporate support to allow a history-centered 
 museum to survive.
 
 In the 15 years since the start, however, TCM has never wavered in its 
 mission to have the world's best collection of significant computer 
 artifacts.  It is the personal passion of Gwen and Gordon Bell, who 
 have donated years of effort and millions of dollars personally, as 
 well as using all the industry contacts they can.
 
 It *is* the best collection in the world, and sadly most of it is 
 not on display.  It's in the back storerooms of TCM in Boston, in 
 rented warehouses in Boston, and recent acquisitions are being 
 stored in Silicon Valley.  We (I) intend to fix that and make it 
 accessible.
 
 Now, on the issue of selling artifacts:  When I first got into this 
 venture, I had what Gwen calls the "naive collector's view" that 
 absolutely *everything* has to be preserved.  How can you possibly let 
 a single Bendex G-15 module, or a 6600 logic card, or a core plane, 
 slip away?
 
 The reality is that you have to.  You just can't -- no museum can -- 
 afford to keep everything.  TCM works from a written collection policy 
 that tries to help with the decisions, but ultimately it requires a 
 judgement call.  Sometimes duplicates (or more) are kept.  But when an 
 item can't be kept, it is far better to sell or auction it to a 
 collector who values it rather than see it become landfill, which is 
 what would otherwise have been the fate of many of the items had TCM 
 not been involved.
 
 Small example:  The museum already has two Gavilan notebook computers, 
 which was an example of an early failed entrant into that field.  (The 
 collection policy covers, among other things, both "firsts" and 
 "significant failures".)  We have just been offered two more by 
 someone whose wife is demanding that he throw them out of the garage.  
 Do we take them?  Answer:  Yes, but for the auction.  Benefits:  Donor 
 gets a tax deduction, TCM gets some income, and the items are 
 preserved by some collector rather than being trashed.  Seems like a 
 good solution to me.
 
 It pains me to read some of the recent comments about TCM's collection 
 policy.  I can't answer any of the complaints about specific items, 
 because I wasn't involved.  I do know, and this comes mostly from 
 getting to know the Bells, that preserving computers in the context of a 
 financially sound organization that can survive our lifetimes is their 
 main priority.
 
 So: what are we up to now?  Plans are still in flux, so I can only 
 describe our current vision.  We would like to establish a "Computer 
 History Center" which is a combination museum and study/research center. 
 We will populate it with the bulk of TCM's current collection, and it 
 then becomes the center of all future collection activities.  There are 
 multiple spaces for formally-presented exhibits, and "accessible 
 storage" for more.  In addition to physical computers and parts thereof, 
 it includes documentation, books, photographs, videos, audiotapes, and 
 software, all of which are currently part of the collection.  The 
 primary target audience, unlike the Boston facility, is adults, not 
 children.
 
 In addition, we would like it to be an academically-oriented research 
 institute whose charter is the preservation and study of the evolution 
 of computer technology.  We are getting an enthusiastic reaction from 
 some of the people at Stanford, where there are already a number of 
 related research and preservation projects.  They will be a likely 
 collaborator.
 
 Physically, the long-term plan is to secure a donated site on which to 
 build a dedicated facility of, say, 60,000 square feet.  We are also 
 mulling over various interim plans.
 
 Financially, we don't expect that this institute can survive by 
 generating earned income.  TCM earns about 60% of its expenses, which 
 is extraordinarily high by museum standards.  This subsidiary will 
 probably earn 15%.  We must therefore raise both building costs and an 
 endowment by fundraising.  These are big bucks, folks:  we're targeting 
 the initial push for something like $15M for the building and another 
 $15M for half the endowment.  It will come (it must come or this 
 project is doomed) primarily from individuals and companies in our 
 industry.  The fact that the IPO stock market has been kind to the 
 computer business in recent years is part of the reason why we're 
 making the push right now.
 
 Why on the west coast?  Well, for starters, I don't think you can do 
 this in more then one place;  it's going to be difficult enough to get 
 the financing for one.  Besides, many of the significant pieces are 
 unique.  And the truth is that there are simply more computer 
 companies, engineers, technology students, and sympathetic 
 organizations per square mile here in Silicon Valley than anywhere else 
 in the world.  That's hard for me, a born-and-bred east-coaster, to 
 say, but there it is.  We think we will have the best shot at it here.
 
 There's lots more to talk about, but I've already made this too long. 
 (For example: running vs non-running machines, complete machines vs. 
 parts, how to preserve software, why there isn't a comp.history 
 newsgroup, etc. etc.) I just wanted to say why I'm working with TCM and 
 what we're trying to do, and I hope we get your support for this effort. 
  Right now we're talking to as many potential large donors as possible 
 to see if this thing will be financially feasible, because without the 
 bucks it's doomed.  But it will also fail without the grassroots support 
 of the people who care, and that's you.
 
 Thanks for reading.

Please don't apologise - it's 100% on-topic, and it needs to be said. I 
should be apologising for some of the things I said about the TCM.

Exactly. And I think that's what the main moan was about. The Computer 
Museum seemed to be claiming that preserving one module was as good as 
preserving the entire machine. That's not the case, and never will be the 
case.

I've given talks to student computer societies on computer history, and I 
always try to have at least one working machine there that can be 
demonstrated. There's a big difference between hearing a talk about a 
machine and actually seeing it in operation, or even better trying it for 
yourself.

I'm not sure that the 'walk through PC' is any more educational than a 
normal-sized PC with the cover removed. It certainly wouldn't be to me.

I don't think you can apply the word 'best' to the collection. I am quite
sure I can name a machine that you don't have, and that at least one
other collection does. But that's not really important. The fact that _any_
historic computers are being preserved is the important thing.

It is almost certainly a very impressive collection, and I'd love to see 
as much of it as possible.

I'd like to present my naive collector's view - I've been a naive 
collector for 10 year :-). It goes like this 'Everything should be 
preserved, but not necessarily by me'. For example, I've often been 
offered a number of identical machines, and as I can't possibly run them 
all, I find other enthusiasts or museums who would like the others. But I 
don't strip them for spares and I don't give them to just anybody.

Indeed. I have no problem with machines being given or sold to 
enthusiasts. In fact in my experience, giving a duplicate machine to such 
an enthusiast is a good way to ensure you have somebody capable of 
maintaining the museum's machine. 

I have a big problem with stripping down a machine and selling the 
modules to the general public who have no idea what they are used for, 
and who will never try to use them electronically ever again.

But even that's preferable to them going in the landfill, I guess.

That's an excellent solution, and I've obtained machines in that way 
myself. But you are talking here about selling a complete machine _as a 
complete machine_. That's fine.

I will stand by my comment that any musuem that dismantles and sells off 
the last of a particular artifact is not fit to be called a museum. It 
now appears that the Boston Computer Museum is not doing that, so I 
hereby apologise to them for any implication that they did. I understand 
that the PDP-6 that started this discussion is still in one piece :-)

I am very pleased that somebody has had the sense to realise the value of 
documentation - particularly technical documentation. A lot of that would 
be lost forever otherwise.

I'd like to hear your views on those subjects - they'll disagree with 
mine almost certainly, but hopefully not too majorly. Here are my views, 
briefly : 

running vs non-running machines. Machines should be kept in running 
condition if at all possible, and knowledge of operation and repair 
techniques should be passed on to the next generation. However, it may 
not be practical to run the machines all the time, particularly for the 
older machines (parts are hard to find, and poor design practices may 
mean that they need full-time attention).

complete machines vs parts. It's obviously better to keep complete 
machines in working condition. IMHO, parts should be kept either by the 
museum or by known enthusiasts, so that they can be used for future 
repairs or restorations. It may be a good idea to have parts on show to 
the public (particularly if you're aiming the collection at 
technically-minded people), but not at the expense of working machines.

Software preservation. I'd be very interested to hear of methods for 
doing this, as it's a lot more difficult IMHO than hardware preservation. 
What are people doing about this ? 

a comp.history newsgroup. Yes, why isn't there one ? It would be very 
useful.
