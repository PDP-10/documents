The 8080 can't do *anything* in two cycles.

On the 6502, if you have a pointer to a memory location in a zero-page
address, you can load the contents of that location into the accumulator
in four cycles.

The 6502 may not have had a very friendly instruction set, but it could
do more work in fewer clock cycles than any 8-bitter of its time except
the 6809.  For most purposes a 1 MHz 6502 was about as fast as a 4 MHz
Z-80.  But back in 1977 you could buy 3 MHz 6502s, whereas 4 MHz was the
fastest Z-80 of the time.

Later they introduced the 6 MHz Z-80, and much later 8 MHz.  They didn't
get much faster until Hitachi redesigned the core in CMOS.

From the comp.os.cpm FAQ:

   The Z180 was not an outgrowth of the Z800.  It was a joint effort
   between Zilog and Hitachi.  The first two versions of the HD64180
   were slightly different from the current Z180.  The current HD64180
   and Z180 are identical, and both have flags in one of the control
   registers to emulate the earlier versions.  The changes are mostly
   bus timing, as the HD64180 was designed to interface with Motorola
   6800 style peripherals as well as Intel and Zilog, which wasn't too
   strange since Hitachi second sources some Motorola 6800 series
   products.

8080 and Z80 cycles are 4 or 5 clocks. 5 clocks for instruction
fetches, 4 for all others. The first processor I ever programmed was
a Z80.

6502 was introduced 1976 at 1MHz, later (first half 1980s) there were
2 and 4MHz around.

8080 AFAIK started somewhere 1-2MHz in 1984. Went up to about 5MHz (or
was that already its 8085 version?).

Z80 started with 2.5MHz in 1976, then 4MHz (Z80A), then 6MHz (Z80B),
then 8MHz (Z80H) in the same time frame.

About 1978 for the first VAX (11/780).

2 and 3 MHz were readily available in 1977.  4 MHz was scarce until 1979.

Bang!


Z80: LD A,(1234)     3A 34 12    13 Tstates, 3.25us @ 4MHz
Actually 8080 could also do that.

6502: LDA 1234       AD 34 12    4 clocks, 2us @ 2HMz
Seems to be the same thing, just a bit faster.

Direct loads from memory were actually one of the 6502s strenghts.

Now anything that required address registers... [1]


[1] For non-6502-programmers: it had no address registers. You had to
use pairs of 8bit memory words in the bottom 256 bytes of memory,
addresed by an 8bit constant in the instruction. A bit like PDP-8
needing to used its in-instruction constant to address an low-memory
word with the actual address in it.


And yes, Z80 and 6502 are both little-endian, not just bit numbering,
but actual memory arrangement of 16 data. Read low 8 bits first,
process, then get high 8 bits. Done so because of address calculation
carry.

>    6502 .eqv. 8080? Pshaw! 8008, more like.

Actually fairly equivlent in effect. Missing instruction power made up
with efficent memory access and so less clock cycles.


P.S. I learned Assembler in the row: Z80, 6809, 6502, 68000, 8088
Of all the 8bit ones 6809 was the nicest, roughly PDP-11 level.

The 6502 (NMOS) did NOT have a zero page indirect non-indexed mode.
It had:

   zero page (non-indirect, non-indexed)       LDA VAR
   zero page indexed                           LDA VAR,X  or  LDA VAR,Y
   zero page indexed indirect                  LDA (VAR,X)
   zero page indirect indexed                  LDA (VAR),Y

The CMOS 6502 added:

   zero page indirect                          LDA (VAR)

All above examples requiring that the address of VAR be in the range
$0000..$00ff.  Also, note that with ZP indexed and ZP indexed indirect,
the indexing will not wrap to the high byte of the address.  In other
words, for "LDA VAR,X" if VAR is $CA and X contains $7E, the effective
address is $0048, not $0148.  Similarly, for "LDA (VAR,X) under the
same circumstances, the effective address is the contents of locations
$0048 and $0049.

Also, for all ZP indirect modes, if the base ZP address is $00FF, the
indirect address comes from $00FF and $0000, not $00FF and $0100.

On the NMOS 6502, the same problem (no carry from low to high byte of
address) also happens for the absolute indirect address mode, e.g.,
LDA ($45FF) will fetch the EA from $45FF and $4500.  On the CMOS 6502
this was changed for absolute indirect (but not ZP indirect), so that
example would fetch the EA from $45FF and $4600.

And it did go far, if you count embedded variants including
the Super Nintendo game system.
