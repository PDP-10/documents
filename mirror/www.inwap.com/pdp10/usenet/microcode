The KL microcode sources and assembler used to be downloadable from MIT-MC.
I remember asking Don Lewine why DEC didn't freak out and sue MIT for leaving
what was then a $25,000 DEC product lying around where anyone could copy it,
and I liked his answer -- the $25,000 price tag is actually paying for the
right to gripe to DEC about the micromachine bugs that a user would surely run
into when trying to run something other than DEC's own microcode.  DEC didn't
have to pay any attention to bug reports from pirates, and as piracy goes,
stealing the microcode isn't such a big deal, since it's only useful if you
have a KL10 anyway and $25K is small change compared to what you paid for that.

Thanks for the info.

Or the KL10-PW, right?

But the 96-bit width is correct, then?

The KL10-PW is functionally very nearly the same as the KL10-PV, so most
of the "model B" docs apply.  There are some details that are changed,
though, and they aren't documented in the System Reference Manual.  :-(
I do have a doc somewhere that describes the changes visible to the
system programmer; I'll try to get it scanned soon.

I don't have the docs handy at the moment, but that sounds right.

The KL10-PW is the CPU of the 1095 and 2065; that is what distinguishes
them from the 1091 and 2060.  Earlier "model B" CPUs (KL10-PV) could
be upgraded to the KL10-PW by replacing some CPU modules (about seven of
them, IIRC), and making a few backplane wiring changes.

The KL10-PW-specific modules can be recognized by the fact that they have
module numbers of the form M-85x (three digits), versus M-85xx (four digits)
for all other KL10 CPU modules.  This was an interesting reversal of the
earlier trend in the PDP-8/e and PDP-11 to replace older Mxxx modules with
new improved designs designated Mxxxy.
