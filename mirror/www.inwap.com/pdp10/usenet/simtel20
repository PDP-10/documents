DEC had nothing to do with it.

Speaking as someone who was there, SIMTEL20 was killed by a combination of
factors:
 1) perceived costs of ownership and maintenance.
 2) perceived irrelevance, inappropriateness, and illegality of the archive.
 3) perceived superiority of AT&T 3B2 systems as "modern" Internet engines.
 4) politics.  The less said about this, the better; the individuals
    involved are now retired.  Let's just say that in government, including
    military, one of the well-used ways to get at someone you loathe is to
    attack his subordinates and their projects.

Note my usage of the word "perceived".  We are not talking about the
perceptions of anyone involved with SIMTEL20.  Consider how item (4)
interacts with perception.

SIMTEL20 suffered a mortal wound over a year before the plug was finally
pulled.  It was not a happy time.  The SIMTEL20 archivist, and especially
the fellow who was the heart and soul of the SIMTEL20 TOPS-20 system from
its inception, bore the brunt.  I have evil memories nonetheless.

I ensured that all the email queued on SIMTEL20 was passed on before the
plug was pulled.  SIMTEL20's last act before the electrons ceased flowing
was to foist the last queued but undeliverable message (due to destination
host down) onto one of the "modern" 3B2s which replaced it.

It is amazing that the archive didn't die, since that was one of the goals
of shutting down SIMTEL20.  At least in that respect, the bastards lost.

There is a lot more to this story than I am telling here, but you'll have
to hear it from someone else.

Mark, I was referring to military use of TOPS-20 not being suffficient to save
*TOPS-20* from DEC. Not save SIMTEL20 itself. Earlier in this thread, before I
added the crossposting, someone had stated that Compaq could never kill VMS
because it was used by the military. I just picked SIMTEL20 as a well known
example of a site with a ".mil" domain which survived into the relatively recent
Internet age.

Presumably the old DUMPER tapes survive. Just to mark a bit of Arpanet/Internet
history it would be nice to bring up the SIMTEL20 archives on an emulated PDP-10
and make it available online. Someone would have to rebuild a KS-10 version of
TOPS-20 with Internet support though as the currently booting TOPS-20 V4.1 KS-10
distribution doesn't have Arpanet support built in. Do you still have a
buildable KS-10 distribution by any chance? Was there ever an official KS-10
distribution with Arpanet support or was that limited to KL-10 distributions
only?

	The famous anonymous FTP archive at wsmr-simtel20.army.mil shut
down 10 years ago today.  It was hosted on a DECsystem 2060.  I used
it often to search for CP/M and MS-DOS software.  I was logged into it
when it went offline.  Here (courtesy of Google, though I do have my own
copy archived somewhere) is the memorial post I made 10 years ago, with
the final session log.

	Today was the shutdown of wsmr-simtel20.army.mil, one of
the few (if any?) remaining DECsystem 2060s on the net.  This was
my favorite site for CP/M software, and I found a few MS-DOS
items of interest as well.  Out of curiosity and as a tribute, I
had an open anonymous ftp session when the machine was disconnected.
Here is the session log; thank you, simtel20.
