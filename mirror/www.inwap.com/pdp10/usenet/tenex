    I haven't been lurking that much recently, so I'm not sure I got
    the original question.  However, here are a couple salient
    timestamps:

    Jan 2, 1973 - I started at DEC as a regular employee.  For the 3
    months prior to that, I had worked on a fixed-price fixed-time
    contract to port TENEX to the KI-10.  As of Jan 2, John Leng and
    the other powers-that-be had already decided to do a "new" OS for
    the next generation of 36-bit hardware.  This decision got made
    during my 3-month contract when: (1) it became clear that TENEX
    really could be made to work on the KI-10, and (2) IBM announced
    "virtual memory", thus making all the DEC marketeers believe they
    hadda have it asap.  (I love it when things like this happen...)

    Over the course of the next few months, Peter Hurley joined me in
    the "new os" group.  We were working for the engineering manager,
    Fred Wilhelm, at the time, not for SWE under Peter Conklin.  Tom
    Hastings also began devoting most of his time to the project as I
    recall, although he continued to report to PFC.  Peter and I had
    offices on 5-5 along with the hardware engineers.  During the
    first year, Arnie Miller and Len Bosack joined the group also.

    March 1, 1974 (approx) - Our group moved to MRO.  This date is
    easy as it was about two weeks after our first (and only) child
    was born.  Sara and I had both been working in the Mill, but she
    was out on maternity leave when the move to MRO happened.  At the
    point we moved, I *think* I had had a small amount of access to
    actual KL-10 hardware, but I'm not real clear on that.  I think
    there was a prototype down the hall on 5-5 that I did a bit of
    hacking on.  We continued to use a KI-10 for quite a bit of the
    work of beefing up the OS that wasn't very machine-dependent.

    When we got to MRO, I think it was just the four of us (dlm, pmh,
    asm, lb) working directly on the OS.  Supervisors came and went,
    and I can't recall exactly when.  Tom Hastings was supervisor for
    a while when we were in the Mill.  Then, Howard Steadman was
    hired.  Lou Cohen was in there somewhere after we were in MRO, and
    then Dick Snyder.  Peter Hurley became supervisor when Snyder
    moved up.  I stayed as technical honcho through first few releases
    and only lost my good sense for a while in the early '80s when I
    was TOPS-20 supervisor for a year.

    Also, don't ask me to nail down dates for the various names!  Ugh.
    I know that Fred Wilhelm came up with VIROS while we were still in
    the Mill, and it was John Leng who always made it sound like VIRUS
    when he said it.  (Not intentionally; it just came out that way.)
    SNARK and the later name madness was foisted on us only after we'd
    moved to MRO though; of that I'm sure.

    (Hey, I just checked and viros.com is available!  Anybody want to
    grab it?  Such a cool name.  snark.com is taken, but it sucks
    anyhow.)

    Anyhow, hope that helps with some of the nostalgia.

Tops-20 v. 3A or earlier will fit in 256K, as will TENEX.  Just have to find
them.  TENEX is probably easier at this point...
