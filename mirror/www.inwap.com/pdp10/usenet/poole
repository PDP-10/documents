Subject: Dave Poole may be lost at sea

If this is true, it is sad news.  For those of you who don't know, Dave
Poole
was the heart and soul of the Foonly.  When the Foonly project at SAIL
died,
many of his designs were subsequently taken over by DEC and became the
KL10.

Poole subsequently formed the Foonly company, and built a single Super
Foonly
(a.k.a. the Foonly F1), the fastest PDP-10 ever built, that was
installed at
III.  The Super Foonly was used to produce the graphics used in the
movie
"TRON".

He subsequently built smaller-scale systems, the F2 and F3 (which were
KS10
scale), and the F4 which subsequently became Tymshare's 26XL PDP-10
clone that
competed with System Concepts' SC-30M.

   KCBS said this morning that: The Coast Guard has abandoned a search
   off Alaska for a Mountain View man named David Poole.  He's presumed
   lost after his 52ft. boat was hit by winds of 80-100mph in Glacier
   Bay.

There is also an article in this morning's San Jose Mercury News on
page 2B.  I know that there is more than one David Poole in the world
-- for example, I know another one in North Carolina -- but inasmuch
as our former colleague was an avid sailor who was involved in two
catastrophic sinkings while he was at SAIL, I would sadly guess that
it is probably him.

The info below comes from the Coast Guard web site for Alaska, in a
release
dated yesterday.
http://www.uscg.mil/d17/allnews/news99/23499.htm

   In an unrelated search also in southeast Alaska, the Coast Guard
suspend
   efforts at 3:55 p.m. to find David Poole.

   Poole left Mt. View, Calif., in September aboard his 52-foot
sailboat, the
   Bird, on a lone trip to southeast Alaska, according to his friend
Barbara
   Aschenbrenner. Aschenbrenner reported Poole missing Friday after she
hadn't
   heard from him in eleven days. Poole last contacted Aschenbrenner
Oct. 25
   after fueling in Hoonah.

   Friday afternoon, the Coast Guard used a Sitka-based helicopter to
search
   Glacier Bay and issued radio broadcasts, asking mariners to report
any
   information they may have about Poole's whereabouts.

   Saturday, a fishing vessel crew found a refrigerator from the Bird in
   Glacier Bay and contacted the Coast Guard. Coast Guard personnel
talked
   with the craftsman, who custom built the refrigerator, and learned
that it
   must be disassembled to be removed from the vessel. This lead Coast
Guard
   officials to suspect the Bird broke apart and sank, according to Lt.
Randy
   Sundberg, a rescue coordinator at the Coast Guard command center
here.

   Saturday, the Coast Guard used a Kodiak-based C-130 to search for
Poole
   throughout southeast Alaska. Pilots from the Juneau CAP squadron also
   searched Glacier Bay.

   Today the 110-foot Coast Guard cutter Liberty, a Sitka-based
helicopter,
   CAP personnel and National Park Service personnel searched for Poole,
   finding chunks of blue fiberglass, an extra-large lifejacket, a blue
tote
   and other debris suspected to have come from the Bird.

   Searchers logged more than 67 hours before suspending their efforts
to
   locate Poole.

It was in the Anchorage Daily News (or at least on their website)
on November 8th.  I, for one, would appreciate any follow-up.

Regretfully, it is the same Dave Poole, a long-time friend.
It was not entirely unexpected, Dave apparently suffered from
arthritis, joint pain had already caused him to give up some
of his hobbies, and the last time we (my wife and I) were
out sailing with him, he spoke of using his boat as a means
of suicide...

(As regards sacrifice, he enjoyed good beer, among other things.)

I learned today that, based upon the location of the floating refrigerator
(all that was left of his vessel) that he was evidentally trying to get to
a safe harbor and nearly made it.

About 10 of them were built.  Four were installed in-house at Tymshare's
facilities on Bubb Road or Valley Green Drive in Cupertino, the rest
were installed by Doug Engelbart (http://www.bootstrap.org) at an
Air Force base back East (Wright-Patterson?  Memory is hazy) as part
of the OFFICE and AUGMENTATION projects.

The prototypes (F4) used a custom board plugged into an Apple ][ for
loading the microcode and diagnostics.  The production models (26XL,
circa 1986) used an IBM PC-XT for that purpose.

None of them were sold to outside customers.
