The SPD for the "DECSYSTEM-2020 Diagnostic Set, Version 1.0" is still
available online at
http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/DECinfo/SPD/22-20-02.txt.

But I found something vastly amusing when I was poking around the
Digital Assisted Services catalog:

I include the VAX systems for reference. You can view these listings
directly by calling up http://www.digital.com/info/DAS-Catalog/ and
selecting "Table of Contents," then "Diagnostics for ..."  And of
course, don't forget that you shouldn't be running the diags without
first purchasing a Single Use License for your individual CPU.

regarding KL10 diags:

I'm pretty sure I remember running DIAMON from TOPS-20.
You could run some of the 10-based 10 diags then.
However, I don't quite rememebr why I was doing it at
the time. Maybe running DFRHB or DDRPI. Obviously 11 based
10 diags are not going to run :-).

I wonder if the module callout will be anymore accurate
in an emulator, than on the real hardware :)

You're forgetting that SYS:MONITR.EXE is a file that is stored on
a TOPS-20 fomatted disk pack, and absolutely no portion of TOPS-20
is running when MONITOR.EXE is read into core.

The bootstrap routines understand how to locate a file on a TOPS-20
disk pack when TOPS-20 is not running.

Standalone diagnostics diagnostics can be loaded in several ways:
  *) Off of mag tape (one at at time, no directory).
  *) Off of the boot sectors of a disk pack (TOPS-10, TOPS-20, it
     makes no difference at this stage as long as the HOM block is OK).
  *) By a diagnostic loader program, which understands TOPS-10 and/or
     TOPS-20 directory structures.

No part of TOPS-20 is needed to load the first program, and that
program is capable of having its own smarts to determine how the disk
is formatted.  The individual diag routines require that DDT and some other
routines be already loaded in to specific portions of physical memory.

You run them under the standalone program loader, which is neither
TOPS-10 nor TOPS-20.  KLDCP is an operating system unto itself.
