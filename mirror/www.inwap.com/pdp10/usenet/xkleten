Dear Fellow PDP-10 Enthusiast,

Over the past 25 years, it's been challenging for all of us to find a
place to run our PDP-10 software.  At the same time, there hasn't
been a library of PDP-10 software that is well taken care of, and
made easily available to the interested public.

I would like to offer a solution.  I have invested in a TOAD-1
machine running the PDP-10 architecture, and would like to make
its capabilities available.  The TOAD is manufactured
by XKL Systems Corporation, and is a completely new hardware
implementation of Digital's 36-bit PDP-10 architecture, not an
emulator running on another platform.  This machine I've purchased
will be a repository for PDP10 public domain software, including the
collection of the DEC-10 and DEC-20 DECUS tapes.

By making access accounts available to an initial limited group, we
hope to learn of any issue areas with our new program.  Through an
account you can set up with us, you can access this library, and run
programs you may not have seen for years.  You may also submit your
own programs for storage, and for use by fellow advocates.  These
programs may be submitted via FTP, email or 9-track tapes.  Once you
have an account established you could access XKLeTen via telnet.
Anyone may download the libraries of software through anonymous
FTP from XKLeTen.paulallen.com.

The machine, named XKLeTen, is configured as follows:
	TOAD-1, 36-bit computing system
	TOPS-20 system software
	32 MW memory board
	4 mm DDS tape drive
	9 track tape drive
 	8 gigabyte disk

I encourage any of you who are interested to contact us to set up an
account.  To be considered for an account, please submit the
following information to XKLadmin@paulallen.com:
	Full name
	Email address
	Interest or purpose in this project (short summary)
	Desired account name

If you have any questions about XKLeTen, or how to execute the
anonymous FTP, please contact us via the same email address.

Bill Gates and I used PDP10s to develop much of Microsoft's early
software.  I hope many of you take advantage of this new opportunity
to keep alive some of your old memories.  


Paul G. Allen

Just one quick note to avoid confusion:

XKL Systems Corporation became XKL LLC as of 1 January 1997.  Paul Allen
started his purchase process prior to the name change, so the older name
appears in their files.

Sometimes I have to wear an *official* hat on the Net, even if I'm posting
from a private account.

Sorry for the delay in XKLeTen's return.

XKLeTen has been back on the net for about a week,
Xkleten.paulallen.com resolves to 216.220.195.4 for the time being. 
We are still working on a FTP problem that prevents PCs which use NAT
from connecting.  Until we have a solution - Telenet works and FTP
works if you have non-NATed IP address.  Accounts from the past have
been preserved.  For XKLeTen related questions or for accounts on the
TOAD please use xkladmin@paulallen.com.

Thank you for patience
