  listings from certain FTP servers, such as on TOPS-20.  Try it if

C-Kermit>

Yes, C-Kermit now includes an FTP client:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ck71.html

The current test version (Alpha.01) pointed to by the URL above doesn't have
the FTP VDIRECTORY command in it, but by working copy does, and so Alpha.02
will have it.  I'll try to remember to post an announcement here.

C-Kermit is available for UNIX (all kinds), VMS, and several other OS
families.  The Windows version is called Kermit 95.  So far only the UNIX
and Windows versions are getting FTP clients.

(And no, it doesn't do TYPE TENEX -- does anybody care?)

- Frank

P.S. TOPS-20 users who try C-Kermit might notice a familiar look & feel.

I did some experimenting with TOPS-20 to Unix transfers.

  For TEXT mode, use a 7-bit byte pointer to read or write the 36-bit file.

  For IMAGE mode, use a 4-bit byte pointer and read two nybbles for
every octet sent (or write two nybbles for every octet received).
(The least significant 4 bits of the first word would be combined with
the most significant 4 bits of the second word.)

  For TENEX mode, use 8-bit byte pointer (which will skip over the least
significant 4 bits of every word).

  For PAGE mode, there was a separate negociation between the two
TOPS-20 systems to skip pages in sparse files.

If an 8-bit program (such as a CP/M binary) was stored on a TOPS-20
system (such as SIMTEL20) and downloaded to an 8-bit platform in
IMAGE mode instead of TENEX mode, the resulting file would be mangled.
But the data could be recovered.  I remember seeing TENEX.COM, a program
for CP/M that would read a mangled input file 9 bytes at at time and write
8 bytes at a time (after discarding the 2 unwanted nybbles).

Indeed, that is how it was often done in FTP clients/servers for
PDP-10's.

From some 1983 sources to FTP for TOPS-20:

http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/pdp-10/BB-EV83B-BM/TCPIP-SOURCES/FTP4.MAC

        SETZM WINDW2            ; Yes. Clear the window page
        MOVX A,<WINDW2,,WINDW2+1>

        LSHC T1,@IMOSHT(B)      ; Shift to get the correct 36 bits
