Yup. DEC and Stevens/Utexas teco compressed the text buffer every time
you did a delete not up to the end. You see, teco needed to keep the
text buffer contiguous. So every text insertion or deletion anywhere but
the end required much shuffling around. I don't think deleted
text memory was given up, btw.

MIT text buffer handling was much more sophisticated. Every text buffer
object had a "hole" (other q/array/string objects didn't). When a deletion
or insertion took place, the hole was move to PT (. or point) and grown
or shrunk appropriately. Since ITS teco ran on ITS, TENEX, and TOPS20,
I believe also that page maps were manipulated to grow/shrink the hole
or end of buffer for large changes. This scheme was far more efficient than
the DEC/Stevens tecos, but every routine that affected text buffers had
to know about the hole.

Call me a packrat, but I came accross a listing of Stevens/Utexas teco.
Here's the comment for the AC loop code to expand the text buffer:

; The following is the code used to move characters up.
;
;LP:  MOVE  T1,<PT/5>(T)      ; Get a word
;     ROT   T1,-1             ; Get rid of the extra bit
;     ROTC  T1,-7*<# chars to insert>/5 ; Move chars down into T2
;     MOVEM T2,<<PT/5>+<# chars to insert>/5>(T3)
;     ROTC  T1,-<35-7*<# chars to insert>/5>
;     SoJGE T3,LP             ; Loop for <<END/5>-<PT/5>> + 1 if
;                             ;  REM(<<# to insert>+END>/5) > REM(PT/5)

The compression code was smarter and more extensive. For small counts,
it just did byte moves. For longer ones, it checked if source and or
destination byte alignments were needed, and moved the best routine to
the stack (where it runs faster on a KL).

Trivia note: at LP+1, the 36th bit gets cleared. In Dec teco, this bit
was set to indicate that this word (5 bytes) was a line sequence number
beginning a new line. The previous word was null filled after the crlf.

Re: compile on the fly code:
I can think of a few examples:

1. The BBN Blt terminal. BitBlt's were compiled on the fly (68000 code).
2. The blt routine for the X implementation on the QVSS frame buffer
    generated VAX code on the fly (written by Dave Carver)
3. Interleaf Desktop Publishing software image manipulation routines
     (ie, rotation, scale, skew) generated code on the fly for many
     of the original architectures (ie 68000), but on RISC architectures
     with seperate instruction cache's (ie most mips implementations),
     you had to do a cache flush (so the instructions you created made
     it out to memory and into the icache) first (big lose). Hence, most
     architecture implementations use straight C code - well the appropriate
     one for big/little endian and word size/alignment of the machine.
     Even without compiling on the fly, its magic. Written by Bob Watkins.

Pretty much true.  I TOPS-6-ized the MIT TECO in my spare time while
sitting around at SAIL during the installation of their PDP-6.  Mainly
to have a better editor than EDLIN (or whatever) to use while I was there.
I happened to have the TECO source with me at the time.  That would
have been -- guessing -- August 1966?

The only terminals available to me at the time were TTY-33s and TTY-35s.



And on another point, someone recently spouted a silly rumor that
a "JRST @." would hang a KA-10 and asked for an old-timer to refute it.
I (project engineer for the KA-10) refute it, of course.  I posted to
that effect a week or so ago, but posts from here weren't getting out
for a while.

Okay, I *know* that this is *not* the place to post, but I have asked
this question
on a TECO newsgroup and a DECUS newsgroup with *no* real success.

Can any of the old-timers here tell me where I can get a TECO manual
from the 'Net?
Ten years or so when I was working at General Dynamics in San Diego, ago
I had a
9-track tape from a VAX that contained this manual. I made a printed
copy, but I
would like to have a magnetic copy also.

The title page from my printed copy says:


               			          Standard TECO


            TEXT EDITOR AND CORRECTOR FOR THE PDP-11, PDP-10, AND PDP-8


                     USER'S GUIDE AND LANGUAGE REFERENCE MANUAL



                          Preliminary Edition - April 1979



                                TECO-11 VERSION   34
                                TECO-10 VERSION    1
                                TECO-8  VERSION    7


It says it is Copyright 1979 by the TECO SIG. Permission is given to
copy the manual as
long as it is *not* done for profit.

TIA.

Versions of the TECO V40 manual are on Pete Siemsen's DECUS tape.
(VS0099, I believe.)  For some bizarre reason, this tape is
no longer available from DECUS (despite the fact that it is
certainly one of the most useful tapes they ever produced!)

Fortunately, the contents of the tape are available by anonymous
ftp from several sources.  Try ftp://ftp.usc.edu/pub/teco/doc.tar.Z,
or, for a non-tarred-and-compressed V40 manual, go to

ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/academic/computer-science/history/pdp-11
/teco/doc/teco.doc

(Yes, that's all supposed to be one line!)

It seems to be quite a branch off from your TECO evolutionary tree,
but the sources to the TECO distributed on the TOPS-10 7.03 CUSP tape
can be found at
   
http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/pdp-10/CUSPMAR86BINSRC_1OF2_BB-X128B-SB.html

You'll probably want to pick up TECO.MAC, TECO.DOC, and TECO.ERR.

At a different point in its evolution, you'll find a version of
TOPS-10 TECO from 1980 or so at

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/www/lib10/0474/

and a version that's been very slightly patched for TOPS-20 at

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/www/lib20/0139/

The abstract from these DECUS distributions is below:

 TECO-10                         Abstract


 TECO-10 is a considerably extended version of TECO.  It is based on
XTEC,
 rather than DECsystem-10 TECO, so it is a compiler, not an interpreter.
 It includes essentially all of the features of XTEC (although some have
 been renamed for compatability with TECO-11 and TECO-8).  It includes
 window support (written in TECO-10 so it can be customized easily!).
 Terminals supported are VT52, VT61, VT100 (in VT52 mode), and VT05.
 Any q-register can be made to function as the text buffer, and files
 can be read or written to/from any q-register, so several files can
 be edited at once.

 Two screen-editing subsystems are available written in TECO-10.
 These are VT and VTEDIT.  Both are included with TECO-10.

 TECO-10 is mostly compatable with TECO-11, TECO-8 and TECO-VAX

 TECO-10 will run on either the DECsystem-10 or the DECsystem-20
 (under feature-test).

And that explains why the one I tried wasn't TECO.  There was
something strange about its behaviour but I couldn't describe
it to the guy interested in hearing about bugs.  I'm so
relieved.  I thought I was going nuts.

No kidding :-)  This was Texas-TECO formerly Stevens-TECO :-)  But it was a
branch off the "true" TECO tree.  It came before the Stevens transplant to
TECO200 which was a video TECO.  It WAS upwards compatible from "true" TECO.

And not with "true" TECO - ISTR it was a complete rewrite.  It did look
like TECO-11, which was an advantage, but it did not look like TECO, which
was a disadvantage.  (All IMHO - I used them all :-)

XTEC!  Wow!  I'm glad to hear that!

XTEC was originally written by Jack Krupansky at Stevens Tech.  Around
1975, I took over the effort, and hacked on it for a couple of years.
Among other things, I made sure that XTEC had all the features of the
Stevens extensions to TECO (many of which I suggested, although I doubt
that there's any credit given to me for having done so [*]).  I then
submitted XTEC to DECUS.

Although I think that I got XTEC running under WAITS, when I started
working at SAIL in July 1977 I started using the standard WAITS E editor
instead of XTEC.  Then, briefly in 1984, I used XTEC for a while at
Systems Concepts before I got TOPS-20 running and could use EMACS.

[*] By the way, I was also responsible for suggesting the better user
interface in EMACS for entering file names, etc.  In the original EMACS,
if you typed ^X^F, it would create a minibuffer with a bunch of TECO
commands to read in the file, and leave the cursor at the correct point in
the minibuffer for you to type in the file name.  I suggested that it
should prompt you for the filename at the bottom of the screen.  These
days, you hardly ever need to use a minibuffer to enter commands. I doubt
that EMACS would have maintained its popularity over 25 years if it
remained as oriented towards users dealing with TECO commands.

I figure I'm not the only one that's been wanting some TECO doc's.

Thanks to someone on the CLASSICCMP mailing list pointing out that the TECO
manual available at the Sunsite PDP-11 Archive is for the PDP-10, PDP-8,
PDP-11, and VAX-11, I've now got it available on the PDP-10 Emulation
webpage under Applications Documentation.  I've got an Adobe Acrobat copy
for easy printing as well as the original text copy.

http://www.aracnet.com/~healyzh/pdp10emu.html

I've also got the TECO Pocket Guide for the PDP-8, PDP-10 and PDP-11.  I'll
be scanning it in the next time I have my scanner hooked up.

It's should also be noted that the DDT on ITS (on the PDP-6, 
and later, the PDP-10) was much more powerful than the version
of DDT that was available on the DEC operating systems.

It's the same story as TECO: invented at MIT on the PDP-1 and the PDP-6,
ported to the PDP-10, and at some point fairly early on, a version made 
its way to DEC.  It's the same small group of players from MIT and the
same time-frame, by the way.  Serious development on the program(s)
continues for years at Project MAC, meanwhile DEC stays forever with 
the ancient version lacking most features.

Most people remain unaware of the MIT version, which the MIT people
think of as the "real" and normal version; MIT folks refer to the DEC 
versions with some disdain as "DEC DDT" and "DEC TECO". 
Meanwhile DEC wonders what is the noise about some weird version
of DDT or TECO that they apparently have over at MIT.

DEC also used their MACRO assembler, while MIT used a much fancier 
and more efficient one called MIDAS.   (Unlike the above, I do not
think these programs had a common ancestor, however.)
