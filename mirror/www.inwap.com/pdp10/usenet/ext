I have sent him this list of TOPS-10 file extensions.
I'm sure there are some that I've missed, and some TOPS-20 specific ones.

	PDP-10 extensions

File system
SYS = system file (SWAP.SYS, SAT.SYS, HOME.SYS)
UFD = user file directory
SFD = sub file directory

Program binaries
REL = relocatable object file (input to LINK-10 or LOADER)
OVL = overlay (pre-virtual memory)
SAV = zero-compressed executable binary
DMP = uncompressed core dump
LOW = low segment of a two-segment program
HGH = high segment of a two-segment program
SHR = shareable hiseg
EXE = page-mapped executable binary

Compilers (all of these create REL files)
MAC = MACRO-10 Assembler
FOR = FORTRAN-10
F40 = FORTRAN-4
F77 = FORTRAN-77
SIT = Steven's Institute of Technology load-and-go Fortran-77
CBL = COBOL
SNO = SNOBOL
SAI = SAIL
FAI = FAIL
BLI = BLISS-10
B36 = BLISS-36
PAL = program assembly language (PDP-8 code cross-compiled on a PDP-10)
ALG = ALGOL
MOD = MODULA-II
PAS = PASCAL

Text files
BAK = editors rename their input to create a backup file
TEC = TECO macro
HLP = help file
TXT = genral text
MEM = memo
RNO = RUNOFF input, creates MEM
DOC = general documentation
RND = RUNOFF input, created DOC
PLM = program logic manual
LPT = line printer output
CTL = batch control file
LOG = batch log file
MIC = macro interpreted commands (sort of like a BAT file on MS-DOS)
CMD = indirect command file
CCL = concise command language; used by COMPIL.EXE to talk to compilers
TMP = temporary
DDT = commands for the DDT debugger, or FILDDT file patcher
PAT = commands for the DDT debugger, or FILDDT file patcher
SCM = source compare - FILCOM output showing differences by line
BCM = binary compare - FILCOM output showing differences by octal words

Binary files
DAT = general data, might be text or binary
BIN = general binary
PLT = plotter (one byte per increment)
QUE = print queue, submit queue, plot queue

To this list add:

 BCL = BCPL
 ALW = Algol-W
 SIM = Simula-67
 A68 = Algol-68

I'm sure there were others, but most of my program listing files are in
storage somewhere in my study at home...

I was involved in a project to compare "systems programming" languages
on the DECsystem-10. We started with a BCPL program which produced
cross references for BCPL programs and then rewrote it in various languages
(Simula-67, Algol-60, Algol-68, Pascal, Macro-10, BLISS-10). My favorite
was BLISS-10 of course, although I still have a soft spot for Algol-68. When
I'm rich enough, I might just buy a copy of the Algol-68 compiler for Windows.
