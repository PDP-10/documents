Mr. Carlini is almost certainly referring to "Computer Engineering" by
Bell, Mudge and McNamara, Digital Equipment Corp., 1978, ISBN
0-932376-00-2.  If you do not have a copy, or access to a copy, by all
means rectify the deficiency as it is *THE* insider reference to all DEC
machines up to the VAX11/780.  It is written as a collection of case
studies of the various DEC machines, busses, software and other entities
by the creators of those entities, and tells you why they did what they
did, and what they'd do differently had they the chance to do it again.
Absolutely fascinating, it should certainly be on the reading list of
everybody who monitors this newsgroup.  Mr. Carlini speaks of getting
his copy down from the shelf; I keep mine on my desk for quicker
reference - when it's not on my nightstand.  It may be found online at:
