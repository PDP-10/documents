TOPS-10/TOPS-20 RSX-20F System Reference Manual, AA-BS94A-TK, AD-BS94A-T1
(TOPS-10 version 7.03, TOPS-20 release 6.1, RSX20F version 15-15)
Page 10-24: DH11 DATA BASE, status of up to 128 TTY lines.
Page 10-29: CD-11 DRIVER DATA BASE, status bits for CD-11 card reader.
Page 10-30: LP-20 DRIVER DATA BASE, status of line printer.

I need to clear up a misstatement on my previous post: there was no
plotter or card punch connected to our 1091.  I was, indeed, confused.

We had upgraded the plotter to a Calcomp unit that had an RS-232 interface.
The card punch was a device that had a keyboard and an RS-232 interface. I had
to modify SPROUT to talk to these devices.

We had two Data Products printers; one connected to the KL's BA-10 (left-over
lineprinter controller from the KA), the other had an A/B switch so that it
could connect to the KL's LP-20 or to the KS's LP-11.  The high-speed card
reader was a CD20 connected to the KL's CR-11.

This isn't the first time that I wish somebody had preserved the 
MCO files (not the ones we shipped on the monitor tape) but the 
ones that contained all the MCOs written.  There's a hell of a
lot of documentation and information that's been lost because
somebody dumped "old" stuff.

Yeah, but the LP-20 was too expensive.  What we had was a board from
DCA that was an LP-11 clone.  They provided the device driver for it;
I'm not sure, but I think it was called LP1SER.

I cannot say whether DCA got your code or they re-invented the driver.
It just worked.

Well, you're not losing your mind (at least the above message isn't
sufficent evidence of the hypothesis to make a conclusive judgment)
but the answer is still no. That is, the FE-connected devices did not
(and logically could not) respond to CONO, CONI, DATAO, and DATAI.
What happened was that the pseudo-device trapped through the device
dispatch table into the front end driver (what was it called, FESER
doesn't sound right--DTESER?) and the front end driver pushed it onto
the DTE queue, where eventually it got eaten by RSX20F and later a
successful return was pushed back over the FE, resolving the system
call. So LPTSER, etc, did not have to be rewritten or modified any
more for the FE than they had to be for remote (DC72) lineprinters,
etc. Since the networked devices (DC72/DN8x) were introduced before
the -KL, I don't recall any modifications which were required. Lots of
modifications were required to make the FE code work, though.
