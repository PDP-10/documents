Actually, the last autopatch tapes weren't autopatch tapes, they were
TSU (TOPS Software Update) tapes.  Getting the keys to the right customers
was a bit of a pain especially since the wrong key was sent out for
one product on its last release tape and a special tape had to be made.
This was post TOPS-10 7.04 and TOPS-20 7.0.

TSU replaced whole files instead of using SOUP/CAM/whatever to update
sources or DDT to update object only products (e.g.  RMS or DBMS.)  Not
only was this easier when installing the updates, it was a whole lot
easier to create the updates (especially the DDT patches.)
