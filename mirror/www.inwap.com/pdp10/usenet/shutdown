The following comes to us from Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College District

On Monday, October 13, 1997, at 3:15 PM they switched off on the
DEC 10 for good. I think they made a small ceremony out of the
occasion. I heard that within an hour or two the temperature in
the room dropped from 76 to 67.

It seems that Yogi was shut down last week for good.  I guess using
a 2065 for accounts receivable is no longer a reasonable thing.  The
system will probably be donated to the Cambridge public school system
as spares to keep their's up and running.  (As I understand it,  we traded
it in to DEC years ago, but they said we could keep it until we got our
software migrated off it, as long as we kept a service contract)

I'll keep my eye open for anything that they are planning to toss...

I apologize for the OT nature of this post, but some of the seasoned
readers may find this event of interest.
-------
Hi all,

Last night I received Email indicating that what is probably the last
operating Xerox Data Systems Sigma mainframes are being powered down
today
and scrapped Friday. These were 2 dual processor Sigma 9s located at
Robert Plan Corporation, who acquired them via (the now defunct?) Warner
Computer Systems.

The SDS/XDS Sigma series played significant roles in the development of
computing technologies such as the ARPANET, timesharing, real-time
computing, computer use in the liberal arts, and the space program. The
corporate history of SDS/XDS is also very interesting and especially
poignant given the later personal computing fumbles by Xerox.

As a high school sophomore I first used an XDS Sigma 7 running BPM at
the University of Texas at Arlington in 1972 and it helped launch my
computing career. Many university students were introduced to computing
via the Sigma family and although I never used it, users of the CP-V
timesharing system still sing its praises.

I have been attempting to gather as much information, ephemera, software
as possible for an XDS/Sigma web page and (more importantly) for
archiving at the Computer Museum History Center
(http://www.computerhistory.org). If you should have, or know of, ANY
information, documentation, history, software, hardware, etc. or have
pointers to persons who worked with Scientific Data Systems/Xerox Data
Systems systems (SDS, Sigma, and 560) please contact me.

Regards,

Lee Courtney
President
