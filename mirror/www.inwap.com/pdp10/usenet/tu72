Out of respect for everything that's decent, let's not say "TU7n."

TU70s TU71s and TU72s came from Storage Technology Corp.  TU78s came from
garbage manufacturers.

The STC drives were, in a word, brilliant.  They were and are the only tape
drives DEC ever slapped their nameplate on that I would trust useful data
to.

Sadly, DEC put a 100% markup on the drive (comparing bought from STC price
vs. bought from DEC price), and instructed STC to never deal directly with
DEC customers.

Instead, DEC pushed those POS TU78s.  An operator, trying to do a backup to
a TU78 (often an exercise that was even worse than a waste of time) would
often find that upon rewinding the tape, the stupid 78 couldn't read the
tape label that it'd just written a few minutes before.  For those not in
the know, this was quite an achievement on the part of the TU78, as the 6250
BPI tape density had so much error correction that you could lose one track
on write and two tracks on read and still get your data back.

If one could buy a TU72 directly from STC, it'd have come at a cheaper price
than what one would pay for a TU78 from DEC, but sadly, Digital's
"Marketing" department took care of that.

To be fair, although the TU70,1,2 drives were pretty inexpensive, the
interface to the -10 or -20 wasn't.  It involved a STC controller
('spensive) and a DX-10 or DX-20.  The latter had wirewrapped components.
The rumor was that Digital had only ever planned on selling 4 DX-20s, so it
never bothered to setup a real manufacturing line for them.  Whether or not
that's true, one place I used to work had 10 of the only 4 DX-20s ever
built. ;-)

An interesting thing about reading blank tape:

TOPS-10 would time out requests.  If it issued a request and didn't get a
response in about 3 mintues, it'd kill the request, and return "Hung
device."  A TU-70 could actually get to physical end of tape on a 2400 foot
reel in that time (it being a 200 IPS drive).  Trying to read a blank tape
could exhaust the entire reel before getting a hung timeout.

FWIW, from memory, TU-70 was 800/1600 BPI 9-Track 200 IPS, TU-71 was a
7-track drive, TU-72 was 1600/6250 BPI 9-Track 125 IPS.

STC also sold a 1600/6250 9-Track drive that did 200 IPS (memory fades, but
I believe it was their model number 3670), but DEC didn't have any channels
that could reliably keep up with it.

How times have changed.  6250 bytes per second at 200 inches per second
turns out to be 1.25 megabytes per second (decimal megabytes).  Today, we'd
turn our noses up at drives that couldn't do that.  The DDS-3 DAT drive on
my PeeCee can handle 1Mb/sec uncompressed;2 Mb/sec compressed, and that
seems slow.
