10-10-00 slipped by us, didn't it?  I was going to announce this on
DEC-10 day, but I couldn't really wait.  Besides, we've got 10-20 day
coming up soon.  As some of you might know, I've got a band that does
some electronic/punk sort of music.  We recorded a song based on the
ending of Alice's PDP-10.  Its more like a commercial I suppose.. but
it brings up alot of questions from fans of our music which allows me
to get on my soap box on what hacking is.

Wow .. I have had alot of miss-reads on my post.  I clearly stated that I
wanted to announce it on DEC-10, but it was suggested by Daniel Finster
that I announce it on 10.10.00 or 20.10.00.

I hope you liked the song, though I wished I had included the two lines
instead of substituting my own .. I intended to, but it was a rush on the
fly thing in a little studio in joshua texas while we were on tour.  Still,
the whole idea being to call DEC up and playing the song over the phone.

I still owe Clive a copy of our 'report' we did in 1995 for our performance on
DEC-10 .. 30 years, 36bits.  Sorry Clive, and I hope I can still get a patch?
Unfortunately we're currently touring SE Asia and I don't have access to that
report.  But I'll send you a CDR or even a CD .. We recorded TECO and DDT and
released it just a few weeks before going on tour here.  Its on our 'Deny
Authority' release which also has a reference to the KL-10 and LISP Machines
while addressing concerns about what people are calling 'advancements' in
technology with Technology Gone Bad.
