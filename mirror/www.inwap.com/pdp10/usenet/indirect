As I racall all of the KA10s that also had relocation imposed a limit of 
18 levels of Indirect. These would be any with serial numbers higher than 
at least 75. I believe that the KI10 also had this limitation.

Hi Tom...  Absolutely correct.  (Actually the FAP mnemmonic was XEC.)
See http://www.best.com/~thvv/7094.html for the story of one such hang.

Microcode!  Foo.  I thought we were talking about REAL computers
that didn't need their brains spoon-fed to them every time you
turned them on.

Well, neither the 166 nor the KA-10 nor the KI-10 had that bug,
even during initial prototype debug.  So it was brand new on the KL.
Maybe they loaded 7090-emulating microcode?  :-)

(There _was_ that divide bug that hung the KI, though...)

See, that supports my theory; a canonical feature of microcoded instruction
sets is an additional number of bugs in the macro-level instructions inherited
from the kind of bugs you get from linearly coded algorithms (e.g. off-by-one
bugs, infinite loops, etc.).  Case in point: the longest I ever spent chasing
down a bug was 2-weeks trying to find what turned out to be a missing
semi-colon I had accidentally left out in the F3 tape controller microcode. 

Semicolons delimited micro words, and the micro-assembler would of course 
allow the text for one micro-word to occupy more than one line. So, all the 
fields for the two instructions got or-ed together, and somehow I didn't 
notice the missing semicolon (must have been that my eye was still too tuned 
to PDP-10 code where of course semi-colons are optional, sometimes too 
optional!).

So you could say that this type of syntax contained this canonical bug of 
or-ing two microwords together, and the microcoded architecture of the F3 
inherited that class of bug.

Another example of bugs inherited from architectural features is found in 
microcode engines that have timing fields in the instruction words. The 
canonical bug of course is that the timing field is not long enough to cover 
the settling time needed by the particular instruction.

The infinite @ bug was caused by a missing check for PI system activity in
the microcode that implemented indirection. Easier to do in microcode than 
when you design the CPU entirely with wired logic, right? I'm sure though that 
when you guys designed the initial machines you had to pay careful attention 
to the potential bugs the architecture could generate and make sure they 
weren't present.

Gee, I don't remember the details.  I wasn't there at the time, and we
never had any KI's here at BBN.

It was one of those oddball case things, something like IDIV of SETZ
over TRN or some such thing.  Hung the machine in a hardware loop.
Happened in User Mode too, of course.  No way out but the reset
button.

And no, unfortunately, it was not found in initial testing.  There
were machines in the field (I forget how many).  As soon as the word
spread, of course, lots of machines were hung as people just had to
try it themselves.  It caused a lot of fast trips by field service to
install the mod.

Sorry I can't remember the date.
