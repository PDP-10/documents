Nope.  There was a Pete Wilson, but he left sometime in 1972 or 73.
Alan Wilson was the guy who did the 1091, ala, Alan Titcomb, when

Yup.  It was.  Since he was the other GALAXY inventor, his
name and initials should be sprinkled all over all of the
GALAXY modules...unless somebody sanitized those, too.

CGN was *me*.   Charles ("Chip" to those  who knew me) G. Nylander.

Hi BAH, remember me?  Probably not.  I was unremarkable.  You were
always nice, though.

Others that I know that I don't think have been provided in previous
replies:

RL	Roger Lipsett
EGM	Evelyn McCarthy
WCL	William (Bill) C. Lynch
DJB	David Bell (probably) 
LCR      L. Carlos Rodriguez
EAR	Ernie Racine
VJC	Victor Coppella (probably)
LLN	Laura Neff (where is David Neff?  Did he never touch TOPS-10?)

I'm a bit surprised at the initials that aren't in the list.  Where is
Don Dossa, Ira Machefsky, K.P. Young, Ed Fortmuller, CLRH, and others
I expected to see?

DJB was NOT Dave Bell.  DBell's full name is David Roger Ingals Bell.  (Don't even ask how
I know...)  a.k.a.  Buzzard.  He used DIB as his initials, IIRC.

CLRH is still married to KP Young, and still, as far as I know, living in the development
in Hudson Mass that's right behind the HLO buildings.

CLRH was "Charlotte L. Richardson Houde".  She did enough "stuff" that
I had expected to see her initials in the list of maintainers.  An
energetic maintainer.

As a previous reply pointed out, she was last seen happily married to
Paul Young in Hudson, MA (which I suppose makes her CLRHY now....).

In the 1970's I was too young and inexperienced in the ways of the
working world to  realize what a gem of a colleague CLRH was.  Oh that
all the people I work with now could be so good-natured and energetic
at the same time.

Nope.  Dave was a late comer.  If he had the same initials
that had already been used, the rule was that he would have
to pick a unique set.  That's why you really can't match
real names to initials and why Magee's file is valuable.

Not only do I have a BGE EMail alias for Bernie dating to the mid-80's,
the ``Regarding'' header below demonstrates that *he* thought that his
middle initial was G on 12-Oct-83:

He also gets credit to this day for contributions to KERMIT.

Dave made 155 edits signed DAW in FORHST.MAC alone, and DEC licensed

So what?  Don't you read what I write these days?  I'll repeat
that initials that went into listings didn't necessarily match
a person's birth name.  Now, Eiben's initials may have been
put into listings.  I'm just documenting 1. the tradition and
2. what I remember about who did what when.

And he also gave TW some code fixes once with the request to not
include his initials.

And that by my definition is a latecomer.

But it would have been a better start because the file contained
the "real" letter usage no matter what the developers' actual 
names were.

The method was usually a word of mouth cooperation.  When the
"latecomer" era happened, quite a bit of that stopped.

I do seem to recall that Bernie didn't care for "credit".  Credit
also meant ownership of any problems the edit might have generated.
If it was S.MAC, he might have had TW define some bits for
diagnostics.  Damn, I'm really getting to hate this disease.  
Bernie might have been involved in the SPEAR project or the 
TU70 project.  That was about the time he haunted TW's office.
Of course, I have no idea what was done during the years of
1973, 1974, and part of 1975 since I wasn't doing the monitor
edit nor was my office in the monitor groups' area.

Are we talking FOROTS.MAC here?  You should also remember that
the PDP-10 product line was ended as of 1983.

I don't remember Dave Wright making any FOROTS V5 edits.  Now,
interpret that statement to be "development of V5 FOROTS".  The
first I remember of Dave is working on V6 which was a complete
rewrite of FOROTS.  I sure don't remember doing an edit to
V6 in 1980.

1.  Two "p"'s?  Strappman.
2.  An edit of Hanley's was once logged against LINK using the initials
HAS.  Eric Magrath ultimately changed the initials before shipment.
3.  Favorite graffito: written in the inter-tile grouting above one of
the urinals on MR1-2 (probably the northernmost men's room):

Red ink:           n't
Blue ink: Hanley was  here.

Harumph!  They wouldn't let me have my printouts go to "Nothead" 'cause
that wasn't my name.  So I used "T,Nothead" :-)

AFAIR, he was strictly contract; but he sure did a whole lot
of code.

Yup.

This is Charlotte, isn't it?

>MJM	?

Mary Morotta.  She was the last writer for TOPS-10.
Just as a note:  At some point, some body thought it
would be a good idea for the writers to go over the
comments in source listings and make it into English.
And that's how some of their initials got in.  There
were a few who actually did some real work, and corrected
error messages.  And, now, I'm trying to remember the
name of a writer who actually did some mods...Laurie Piper?
She was killed in a car accident.  She was a damn fine writer,
had common sense.

>DAS	? (David Stone?)

I don't remember him doing any code.  It would have to be
in John's time frame.  When I started Stone was already 
a manager, but I thought his background was exclusively
small computers.

>LWS	?

I know who this but my brain is just not producing proper

did quite a bit of GALAXY work.  Tall, blond.  Shit, sorry,

That nickname came from TW after Doug did something that
broke the rest of the monitor.  TW didn't give a shit what
he did with the KS, but he certainly cared about what
he did to the KL.

What code did those initials come from?  They also match Jim Selders,
who worked on Algol, DDT, and I don't know what else.

LWS is Larry Sendlosky. You'all hired him from SAIC in Oak Ridge into the
group doing DECsystem-10 SPRs. I had stolen him from Jim Grossen at
University of Tennessee (he still hates me for that). Then, he went back to
ORNL and you got him again, but I was gone and lost track.
