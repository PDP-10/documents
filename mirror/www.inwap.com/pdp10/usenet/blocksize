A block is either 512 8-bit bytes (RT, RSX, VMS) or 512 9-bit bytes (TOPS).

For the 36-bit operating systems (TOPS-10, TOPS-20 and variants) a block is
128 words.  That translates to:
    32 128-bit quad words (from cache to/from main memory)
    64 72-bit doublewords
   128 36-bit words
   256 18-bit halfwords
   384 12-bit PDP-8 compatible bytes (SAIL at Stanford used 12 bits)
   512  9-bit bytes   (control-shift-meta double cokebottle)
   576  8-bit bytes   (4.5 bytes per word, 9 bytes per two words)
   640  7-bit bytes   (regular text files)
   768 SIXBIT bytes   (used by COBOL)
  1152  4-bit nybbles (FTP "image" mode)

The SA-10 (and other IBM-compatible disk controllers) would read a pair
of 36-bit words from the PDP-10's memory and write nine 8-bit bytes to
the disk.  The RH11 controller in the KS-2020 did I/O as 18-bit short
words.  The RP04 and RP06 disks had to be 18-bit formatted for the PDP-10
instead of the 16-bit format used by the PDP-11 and VAX.

The SAIL keyboards with the multitude of shift keys, and a separate bit
for each one, generated 12 bit characters.

Ctrl, Shift, Meta and Top, plus 8 bits for the key, I think.

>What's cokebottle?

From the Jargon File:

    COKEBOTTLE n. Any very unusual character.  MIT people complain about
       the "control-meta-cokebottle" commands at SAIL, and SAIL people
       complain about the "altmode-altmode-cokebottle" commands at MIT.

Both schools used experimental keyboards with additional graphics.  For an
example of one, see the character-set appendix in Knuth's _The TeXbook_.

Brian Harvey added that one, and I never heard anyone other than him use
it.  Not that there weren't other personal jargon items; most notable
being QUUX (Guy Steele) and GAS (Geoff Goodfellow).

It differs by OS and media, as noted by others, but they're mostly Tops-10
folks.  Tops-20 does not use the concept of "block" but rather of "page", which
is defined as 512 *words* of 36 bits each.

(NB:  The *disk drivers* may use blocks, but they are not available to user-
level programs, nor even to the rest of the monitor.  On a SCSI disk, we format
the disk into 2304-bit blocks (128 * 36 bits), four of which make up a page.)
