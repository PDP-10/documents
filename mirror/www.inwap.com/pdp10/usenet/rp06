This is a common myth.  The RP06 does NOT need three-phase power, though
that it is how it is normally wired.  You don't even need a capacitor-start
arrangement to produce "fake" three-phase, because the drive doesn't even
use the third phase.

The RP06 motor only has a single winding, which is wired between two of
the phases.  For normal US three phase power, this is 208V.  But
according to the Memorex 677 drive manual (included in the DEC
maintenance docs), the motor will actually run on a wide range of
voltages, including 220-240V.  I don't recall the limits of the range.

The electronics runs between one phase and neutral on 120V.
So a split-phase 120V/240V circuit (with neutral) would work fine.

If you have a 240V circuit with no neutral, you could use a 2:1 step-down
transformer to power the logic, or it might be possible to reconfigure
the electronics power supply for 240V.

The RP06 also has a three-phase "output" for daisy-chaining a second
drive.  (You're not supposed to put more than two drives in a power chain.)
This is simply the three input phases permuted so as to distribute the
load.
