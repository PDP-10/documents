Heh!  When I was last there (Pittsburgh) several years ago on a business
trip, everything appeared o-l-d.  The Bookbinders restaurant was OK, though.

Weird thing about their school system: nearly everyone I asked believed
Gettysburg was in Virginia.

Ah!  Another ZORK fan!  :-)

Did you know that with the zmachine and the data file(s) from any C64, Amiga
or PC floppy one can play ZORK and other InfoCOM games on even today's systems?

Here's my "ZORK" directory on a Solaris box:

Hey!  These young whipper shappers have no sense of history!  Real men
know that the above quote comes from ADVENT, the original Colossal Cave
adventure.  ADVENT came out in 1972, ZORK didn't arrive until 1977.

According to what I have found, HAUNT was written in the OPS4
language by John Laird at Carnegie Mellon University around 1980-81.
The original source is missing-in-action. There is a source for
HAUNT in OPS5 (*not* OPS4) on the Interactive-Fiction Archive. It
can be found here:

	<http://www.funet.fi/pub/misc/if-archive/games/source/haunt.ops5.gz>


Some information on this game can be found at:

	< http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/laird/haunt.html>

and

	<http://www.lysator.liu.se/adventure/Mainframe_adventures.html#HAUNT>


There are some OPS5 programming systems around the 'net...you can 
find them by googling...ISTM you are going to need an OPS5 
interpreter to run this source code...
