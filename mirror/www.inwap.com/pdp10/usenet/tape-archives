The TPC format is easy - it's a way of representing exactly what's
stored on a magtape.  

Two bytes give the length of the tape record, followed by the
tape record.  Repeat until end-of-tape.

A tape mark is represented as a record of zero length.  Two tape
marks traditionally mark the logical end-of-tape.

What's more complicated is the format used by TOPS-10 BACKUP or
TOPS-20 DUMPER.  I decode these using the DECUS freeware tools
10BACKUP and DUMPER, respectively, both available from ftp.decus.org,
but these programs only run under VMS.  They both deal automatically
with TPC format files, as well as with real physical tapes on tape
drives.  The "individual files" on pdp-10.trailing-edge.com were
extracted using these tools.

For a Unixy box, Phil Budne has added TPC support to his
10backup utility.  See

  ftp://philbudne.ne.mediaone.net/backup10.tar.gz

in particular, the -c option handles TPC tapes.

For TOPS-20 DUMPER tapes, I don't know of a Unixy utility for reading
them.  If anyone does know, I'm listening.

It's Johnny Eriksson's program, I just dressed it up a bit!

I just added it to my version of read20 (by Jim Guyton at Rand, Jay
Lepreau at Utah).  I merged in Stu Grossman's changes and added some
options.

Now available as;
    ftp://philbudne.ne.mediaone.net/pdp10/read20.tar.gz
