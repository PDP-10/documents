This is all true.

The problem is that tape buffers are taken from the Job Status Block, a monitor
data structure, and are limited to 20 pages.  A DUMPER-format tape written at
the maximum blocking factor comes out to 24 pages per block if read back in as
8-bit bytes, so you can't get an arbitrary tape-copy program to work on Tops-20
due to size limitations.

I once set out to create a version of Tops-20 with additional space in the JSB
for tape buffers, to at least allow the copying of maximally sized DUMPER tapes
(so that I could have more than one copy of a bunch of stuff).  It's hard, a
lot harder than it ought to be...

No, it wouldn't.  TOPS-10 supported ANSI-labeled tapes.

When creating a file on tape, the program could optionally use the ENTER UUO
to specify a name to associate with the tape file.

When reading a file from tape, a zeroed-out LOOKUP block could be used
to get the name of the next file.

BACKUP is not involved.  PIP is.

	.COPY MTA:=*.*		; Copy files in current directory to tape
	.REWIND MTA:
	.COPY DSK:=MTA:*.*	; Copy files from tape to disk

It doesn't take much programming effort to make a "dump tape drive emulator"
look for 80-byte records.  You'll find two or more records per block
in tape file 3n+0 and 3n+2 (with data in tape file 3n+1).
