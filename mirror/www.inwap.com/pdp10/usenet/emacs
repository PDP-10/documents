Because the Real Thing is still a single-section program which can only edit a
file that will map into its memory space.  From time to time, I think about the
project of making it use extended addressing, then I lie down till the feeling
goes away...

I remember there was a doc file in the distribution that explained
that getting emacs to run under bottoms-10 (as RMS liked to call it)
would be very difficult.  I don't remember specifics.

MIDAS ran on TOPS-10, it was used for MACLISP. I frequently used MIDAS
on TOPS-10 (it would output .SAV files directly, as well as .REL files).

I borrowed ITS TECO's terminal handling code for my version of FINE.
A *REALLY* fun part was that in MIDAS you could XCT an arbitrary
instruction using a pseudo-op.  I used it to do GETTABs to scan the
monitor's table of known SIXBIT terminal types to decide which
terminals to build in support for!

Commercial versions of SPITBOL are available from Catspaw.  I've done
a free C port of Macro SNOBOL4, with SPITBOL and SITBOL extensions.

See http://people.ne.mediaone.net/philbudne/snobol.html for
information on both.

TECO EMACS did not run on Tops-10, only on ITS and Tops-20.  There was an EMACS
lookalike called FINE ("FINE Is Not EMACS") for Tops-10.

That would be me.  Even RMS agrees!

Full EMACS never ran on TOPS-10 -- It depended on memory mapping of
files, which even in latter days, TOPS-10 never had (although it did
get multiple GETSEG's at some point, which might have served).

EMACS clones that did run on TOPS-10 were "FINE" (FINE Is Not Emacs),
by Mike Kazar at C-MU.  It was written in BLISS-10, and later sold to
Unilogic, purveyors of Scribe.  I have sources (I used to hack on it
when I was at Stevens, my exposure to BLISS-10 made it possible for me
to get a job at DEC, working on FORTRAN-10/20 when I dropped out of
SIT), but the legal status of the sources is unclear.

A closer clone of real EMACS was "Amis", written in Pascal in Sweden.
Never saw sources to it.  I have an .EXE of it from a tape image of
KL1026's PUB: directory:

     36352(36) <455> 1,2      27-Aug-82 pub:[1,6]amis.exe

Ken Harrenstein (KLH, author of KLH10) wrote a portable emacs clone
named "Elle" (Elle Looks Like Emacs) in C which indeed looked a lot
like PDP10 EMACS.  It's alleged to have worked on TOPS10 (under KCC?).
I have sources, with conditionals for TOPS20 (under KCC), but none for
TOPS10.

************ Does anyone have a clean, full, free distribution of KCC?
The only one I've seen was butchered to run on Windoze, and missing stuff.

Craig Finseth's list of EMACS implementations
(http://www.finseth.com/~fin/emacs.html) has this;

AMIS [toc]

      name: AMIS
      last changed/verified: 1994-12-20
      original distribution: ?
      version:
      base language: Pascal
      implementation language: Pascal
      extension language: none
      scope of implementation: command set
      hardware/software requirements: VMS, Norsk Data, Tops10, RSTS
      organization/author:
              Stacken Computer Club

              S-100 44 Stockholm
              Sweden
              stacken@stacken.kth.se

     Note: the name is an abbreviation of "Anti-MISAER" (where "AE" is
     the "ae" glyph). "Misaer" is Swedish (svenska) for "piece of junk,
     or deep shit functionality" (translation provided by the person who
     told me about this) The name thus means "not a piece of junk."
     Tops10, RSTS, Norsk Data versions are free, send them a 1/2 inch,
     2400-foot magnetic tape and return postage VMS version is $1000 US
     (the money supports their DEC10 museum)
     
     Addendum from Jesper Larsson Jesper.Larsson@dna.lth.se: This is not
     quite correct. First, if "misAEr" is the Swedish word, "AE" should
     not be the "ae" glyph (not used in Swedish -- maybe it's spelled
     that way in Norwegian), but an "a" with two dots above it.
     Secondly, this word actually means "destitution" or "penury". It is
     closely related to the English word "misery". [ I am not going to
     get in the middle of a how to translate Swedish to English issue
     here -- Craig ]

A design goal was to emulate EMACS as closely as possible (given the
constraints TOPS-10 and PASCAL, although a small part of it was
written in MACRO-10).
Whenever one of us questioned a design decision, the rest of us replied
"Because EMACS does it that way!". We even made a small sign with that
text to wave in order to save talking ...
