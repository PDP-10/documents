Hi Folks:

Good news! Almost a dot. I finally resolved the disk acess problems.
I had narrowed down to RPXCPY when I discovered a bug in UNISTS in
UUOPWQ.  A bug in UNISTS cause a derail in write attempt and fall into
UUOPW2 (that enter queue and wait for completion) instead of UUOPW1.
Well, I found a HRRZS bug in RPXCPY (in RHXKON.MAC) and fixed it because
a HRRZS instruction failed to clear left halfword. Yes, another typos.

Now I tried to run TOPS-10 v7.04 and was amazed to notice all disk
problems disappeared once!  Also it happened the same in TOPS-10 v7.03!
Both version was able to get the startup option the past.  They attempted
to print a dot but something blocked them from print a dot after 'LOGIN'
ready message.

I investiaged into that and found out the PI system went messed up.  I
fixed it to discern between regular and vector interrupts (from I/O
devices).  Now it functions correctly but something still messed up in
requests and in progress (hold).  Also, I tested my input and my log
showed that TOPS-10 accepted my input and queues them into CTY device.
Now I am working on it to get a dot printed.

My screen log here:
