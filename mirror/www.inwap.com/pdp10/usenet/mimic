Quoting from Maxwell M. Burnet and Robert M. Supnik:
(in their paper on Preserving Computing's Past: Restoration and
Simulation)

An RTL simulator attempts to mimic the major hardware blocks of the
target system and to implement its actual logic equations.  The goal is
absolute fidelity, the test of which is that no piece of software
running on the simulator should behave differently than it would on the
target hardware. In practice, such perfect mimicry is difficult to
achieve, as it requires a painstaking re-creation of timing detail (for
example, the actual acceleration curve of a DECtape storage system) and
access to implementation documentation that has often vanished.
Nonetheless, some simulators have achieved results very close to this
goal: MIMIC, a DECsystem-10 simulator written at Applied Data Research,
was able to run CPU- and device-specific
diagnostics.  (As testimony to the vulnerability of computing's past,
all machine-readable copies of the MIMIC sources appear to have been
lost.)

So here is the question:
Does anyone have a copy of MIMIC software?

I believe MIMIC was partially written by Bob Supnik many years ago...
It so happens that although I don't have the software, I have a number
of MIMIC manuals, which I copied and sent to him since he no longer
had them either...
