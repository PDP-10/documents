Safe, Compatible, Internationally Standardized (ISO), full tasking
(Real Time) support built in, fully OO, portable, proven track record,

---> Ada 95

What is Ada 95 ?
----------------
 
Ada 95 is the latest  Ada standard. It is also  the first ISO and ANSI
standard   programming  language   to   fully  support object-oriented
programming. Ada 95  is fully upward compatible with  Ada 83  (ISO 87)
and has the  same robust  foundation in  Software Engineering. At  the
same time, it provides up-to-date features for today's megaprogramming
tasks, including:
 
   - object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism and dynamic
     dispatching, within the strong-typing discipline of Ada 83.
 
   - Hierarchical program libraries, for composition of subsystems and
     support of multiple implementations.

   - Well-defined support for interfacing to other languages such as C,
     Fortran and COBOL.
 
   - Support for specialized application areas such as:
     System Programming, Real-Time Systems, Distributed Systems,
     Information Systems, and Scientific Programming.

It amazes me to see folks wishing they had a language like Ada only to
never realize that it already exits! 

A *free*, GNU based compiler (GNAT) is available for just about every 
platform/OS out there:  

Intel(DOS, Win95/NT, OS/2, Linux, Solaris, Nextstep, NETBSD)
M68K (Nextstep, Mac)
Mips (Dec Ultrix, SGI Irix)
RS6000 (IBM AIX)
Alpha (Dec OSF, Linux)
Sparc (Sun OS, Solaris)

Don't take my word for it, check it out!
