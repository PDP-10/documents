The DC-10 was the old, ancient, and best of all simple, terminal
controller for PDP-10s. It came out around the same time as the KA-10.
It supported multiple serial terminals. You're probably right that the
I/O instruction was conventionally DATAO TTY, but I vaguely remember
it as conventionally DATAO CON, for DATAO Console. 'course it's all in
the assignments, and was a matter of taste.

This means you're really going to implement all the page-fault stuff
right? Wow! As I recall, TOPS-20 was a little sensitive to page fault
timings. I'm probably wrong about this, but as I recall ITS ran on the
modified page controller that MIT used--would it ever run on a vanilla
KL? I vaguely remember an effort to make it do that, but I never heard
whether anyone got it working.

The terminal controller for the PDP-10 that I remember was actually a
PDP-8/I (I think) with 32K of 12 bit words, and it was described to me as
the predecessor of the UART, that is, it read each bit and assembled a seven
(or eight or whatever) bit byte by sensing the start bit, the data bits, the
parity, the stop and the rest.  It handled 30 or more 10CPS terminals (110
baud, 2 stop bits) and 5 or so 300 bps (High Speed) terminals.

	Kinda doubtful, IMHO, that last bit. Although I well remember
the 8/I used as a "terminal concentrator" via bit-boffing software,
I also well remember UARTs made out of three "System Modules" (tm)
each, programmed very much like (sane) UARTS of today. I would be
_very_ surprised to hear that a bit-boffing 8/I (made of TTL ?)
preceded these system-modules, the basic building blocks of the
PDP-1, -4, -5, and -6.

	Software UARTS are fun. My first was on a machine with vacuum
tubes and drum main-memory, but that post-dated my use of mechanical
"UARTS" (with both "pulling" and "holding" magnets, for all you other
grey-beards :-)

	Apologies for the distinctly thin veneer of -10 content.
Mine was a -6 :-)

This was a device variously named, but generally called a DC72. It was
a remote terminal controller (although it could be connected over a
local interface--indeed at least one local controller HAD to be on an
interface. I'm probably wrong, but I think the hardware box that
connected the local FE to the -10 was called a something like a DL10
(or maybe the DL10 was only used for -11 FE's--in which case I don't
recall waht the box was).

The PDP8/I was MUCH later, and it was a general purpose computer (a
PDP-8 in fact) which sat at the end of a network (see above). You
could hook several terminals (I think 8 was pretty much the max) to
it, as well as a remote lineprinter and a remote card reader. Also, it
could handle speeds much higher than 30 CPS.

It was designed by DAS (Digital Advanced Systems) and programmed by
several people, notably Eric Peabody. Eventually it got superceded by
the DNx series of PDP-11 based front ends.

The bit-banger being described above was called the 680, at least on the 
PDP-8. Back before I joined the PDP-10 Monitor Group I co-wrote (with Don 
Witcraft) a little OS called TSS-8. I was responsible for (among other things) 
the TTY support and had to get intimately familiar with the little beast. I 
seem to recall on the 8/I there was a 680I which differed from the 680 in bit 
sampling rate. I think the 680 sampled 8 times per bit, while the 680I only 
sampled 5 times. But then again that was a long time ago.

In a parallel universe I once ran a small office equipment repair
business.  I used a product called "Fedron" from the Federal
Mining and Manufacturing Company., 288 12th Ave., Roselle, N.J. 07203.
I used it to treat Very Olde Typewrite platens.
Bear in mind -- the rubber/neoprene/what-ever of the roller/capstan/
what-ever is irreversibly changed.  This treatment can make it
*somewhat* better.  But, it'll never be as good as it was on Day One.

HTH,
Jonesy
