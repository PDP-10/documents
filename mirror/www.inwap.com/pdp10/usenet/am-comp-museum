Dear Computer History Enthusiasts:

     I would like to introduce our museum to you. The American Computer
Museum was founded in 1990 as a non-profit corporation with the IRS and
the state of Montana. The original exhibit space was 300 square feet.
Today, it is 6,000 square feet. Our goal is to develop a major computer
technology museum with about 30,000 square feet of exhibit space within
the next 5 years. We have in the past two months established a library
with thousands of magzines, books, manuals, etc. We hope to have the
library open to researchers within the next year or so. We have thousands
of visitors yearly from over 30 countries and all 50 U.S. states. We are
located 90 miles north of Yellowstone Park and about a mile from the
Museum of the Rockies (internationally known for its dinosaur fossils,
Jack Horner, paleontologist, etc. in Bozeman).

The Exhibits & Collection:
     We believe in artifact based displays with interactive enhancements
as budgets permit to highlight the history of computing and computers over
a 4,000 year span. The displays include dozens of typewriters, mechanical
adding machines, slide rules , hand-held mechanical calculators, relay
based tabulators (example: IBM 409), vacuum tube calculators (ex.: IBM
604), early transistor machines (ex.: IBM 1620), other mainframes machines
(ex.: IBM 360, System 3, etc.), analog computers, desktop minis
(ex.:PDP-8, PDP-8/l, etc.), microcomputers (ex.: Altair, IMSAI, PET, SOL,
APPLE II, III, Lisa, MAC, KIM, SYM, etc.), electromechanical/electronic
calculators (ex.: Friden, SCM, Monroe, Mathatron, Anita, Wang, etc.), toy
collection (ex.: mechanical, electrical and electronic toys: Consul the
Educated Monkey, 1918  to Pong, 1970s, etc.), a working industrial robot,
an Apollo Guidance Computer on loan from the Smithsonian,  and many other
diplays covering topics such as computer memory (ex.: Selectron Tube, core
panels, delay lines, etc.), history of electronics, etc.

Computer Pioneer Timeline:
     We have a constantly expanding hall of fame in the form of a timeline
honoring the key players in the history of the computer. We begin with
Pascal and work our way to the present. Where possible, actual autographed
items from these pioneers & their technologies are on display (ex.:
Stibitz (copy of Model K, built by him, schematics, etc.), Atanasoff,
Felker, Kilby, Hoff, Faggin, etc...).

     The American Computer Museum won the 1994 Dibner Award and has been
written about in the New Yorker Magazine, the New York Times, PC Week, USA
Today, etc.

     I invite you to visit our museum. As we like to say, you can combine
bears and bits on your trip (Yellowstone and the museum). All who visit
have an opportunity to have a personal tour of the museum. If you find
yourself traveling, we are only one jet plane away from Minneapolis,
Denver or Seattle. Or if you are driving, you can visit the Computer
Museum in Boston and our museum, both but a few blocks away from the same
interstate 90.

Museum Hours:
September-May: 12:00 noon to 4:00 pm, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays &
Saturdays.
June-August: 10:00 am to 4:00 pm 7 days a week

Admission: Adults $3.00, children 6 to 12 $2.00, special group rates
available.


If I can be of assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me!
