With the cross-posted thread on PDP-11 O/S release dates still around
I was inspired to update some of my lists which can be found at
http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/index.html#lists
including:

TOPS-10 release dates;
	http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/tops-10

	Using the UUOSYM revision history as a guide, I added more
	solid dates.  I also added the version number of UUOSYM
	released with each monitor.

	Sadly, some conventions (upping the UUOSYM major version
	number with each major O/S release, and upping the minor
	version for each minor O/S release, and keeping a detailed
	revision history in the source) were not continued after 7.03
	(post Barb?).  Fortunately, downloading all the copies of
	UUOSYM.MAC I could find on trailing-edge.com I was able to
	track the changes made in the last 4 years.

TOPS-20 Releases;
	http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/tops-20

	This list had been more complete.  I recently added some
	pre-release 1 dates: start of TENEX development, first TENEX
	production, dates of several "KL paging" memos by Dan Murphy.

PDP-6 Serial Numbers;
	http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/pdp6-serials

	Sites for 19 or so of the 23 systems built, includes urls for
	mentions, photos, etc.  Including photos of a dual PDP-6
	installation at Lawrence Livermore Labs!  "Actual" serial
	numbers for only a few systems are known, and even those are
	suspect.

	If any old hands still remember any serials, or if you know of
	any installations not on the list, please let me know.

	If you know of anyone who might know, or know someone who
	might know someone, please pass this message on!

KL & KS Microcode versions;
	http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/kl-ucode
	http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/ks-ucode

	Both are now populated with the revision histories from the
	sources available at trailing-edge!  Much is still missing
	about what versions were released, when, and for/with what
	monitor/hardware releases.

Old Hardware Option "Type" numbers
	http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/types

	Al Kossow and Bob Supnick sent me some new entries
	and new mysteries.

TENEX/TOPS-20 JSYS list;
	http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/pdp6-serials

	new. no information for when various JSYi were added
	in TENEX development, or TOPS-20 development before release 3.

	I haven't found any MONSYM files for 5 series monitors.

The http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/index.html (Phil's PDP-10
Miscellany) has undergone growth, organization, and expansion.

I've added editorial text (ie. actual content) which may not be the
perfect truth, but which I hope helps provide context for those not
previously steeped in the lore.  The "Other History Links" section has
grown beyond the context of PDP-10s, with many links for predecessor
systems (particularly the TX-0 and PDP-1).

The UWA 6 also had memory box sn#1. I will see if I can find a makers
plate and sn on what remains and send photos.  That should solve the
argument bit :)

I should also have a copy of the `TN User Manual' dated April 65.  If
I can find the damb thing, I will scan and post. And sent to Tim.

I do not know the serial number of the Stanford AI PDP-6,
but we were told that it was the last system built.  After the
arrival of the KA-10, the 166 was a second processor in
a home-grown asymmetric dual-processor system.
Its I/O bus was attached to a locally-built interface to
the Type 30 display that we liberated from the PDP-1.
