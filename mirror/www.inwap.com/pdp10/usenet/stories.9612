TW (Tony Wachs) was of the opinion that, if it couldn't be done with a
TECO macro, then it wasn't worth doing.   Most of the pulling apart,
rearranging, etc. of 6.03A in preparation for the SMP project (7.01) was
all done by TECO macros written by himself with assistance from JMF, and,
when they were both stymied, from DMN (Dave Nixon).  There were a few
piles of hair littered around the console and TW/JMF's offices in those
days from all the hair pulling that was done.  And I don't think those two
ever had more fun.

ISC (Interactive Sciences Corp., Braintree MA. later ADP and then First Data)
got a complete network with remote echoing and a guaranteed-correct echo state
protocol working in the middle 70's.  I was involved in the protocol design,
hardware design & implementation, and the -10 side implementation.

We stole as much as we could (conceptually) from TELNET and added special case
hooks for TECO mode, etc., with echoing/break classes defined.  The network
links were (loosely) copied from X.25, and we had a simple routing algorithm.
Worked pretty well.

The network nodes those days were PDP-8's!!  The code there was Not Pretty.
When we got 11/04s we added a lot of remote peripheral stuff.
I designed and built interfaces for the 10 to the 11s.
We also added a connection-based NFS-like network file system before pretty much
anyone else that worked for and from the 11s and the 10s.

The SCNSER changes were not too bad, and mostly improved the clarity
of the logic.  Basically we reduced the number of points where echoing behavior
could change, and then it was pretty easy.  Researching the defined behavior
was harder!

We had customers multiplexed across a single 9600 baud line to San Francisco
(expensive in those days!) and they got local echoing that worked.
We could also drive a roomful of 9600 baud terminals at full bore (well, 6 to
8 from a KA-10, more from a KI).

When KLs came out we decided not to migrate the technology because we didn't
want to deal with the KL's interface to 11s, and the company didn't want to
spend money on software development.

Oh well; we -should- have publicized the technology at the time.  Dunno if DEC
would have looked at it - NIH.  It worked better than LAT.

Actually, there was one thing that made the Burroughs Swapper move;

When the first drives were delivered from Burroughs, there were a few 
inexplicable head crashes.  The drives were returned/repaired and it 
happened again.  So what happened?  Well, the drives were being checked 
out on 5-5 of the mill (the building on Thompson St.) and were sitting on 
the floor parallel to the street.  Every once in a while a trailer truck 
would back up and hit the loading dock and cause the building to shake.  
This also caused the drive to move a little and forced a head crash!  
Shortly after discovering this, an edict was given that all drives would 
be placed on the floor "perpendicular to Thompson Street".  Eventually 
drums were used instead of disks as swappers.

Barbara is probably a little confused.  Indeed, the fix head disks generally
sat there and you never knew they were running.  The early removable disk
pack drives were indeed the stuff of walk-around-the-room lore.  Just watching
them do random seeks was enough to disuade me from searching for their
resonant frequency!

>Didn't the Illiac IV have fixed head disks? They would have a head
>dedicated to a track for fast roll in/roll out. 

Could well have.  Fixed head disks were common in that era.  The -10 had three:

RM10B	The Bryant drum, actually a truncated cone.  As it came up to speed,
	centrifugal force lifted the drum to the heads providing a gentle
	start to flying heads.  Its card cage had point-to-point soldered
	wiring, the only peripheral in the -10 line that wasn't
	wirewrapped, as far as I know.  It was so fast, just a few usec
	per word (I forget the exact speed), that TOPS-10 would swap
	programs to the drum and read them back instead of running the
	memory shuffler when some other program wanted to grow.

RD10	The Burroughs disk. About 4 feet in diameter.

RF10?	About the size of a RP02 platter in a rack mountable box.  Latest
	of the three.

I don't have the specs of any of these at my finger tips.  They were certainly
good technology for swapping and paging in a memory starved system.


As for a home-grown hardware diagnostic, we had occasional parity errors
at CMU in our 64K Ampex core memory, and DEC's diagnostics never found
anything.  So I wrote a standalone diagnostic that had three processes.
The first created one of several patterns, wrote it to the RM10B, read it
back, and checked it.  The second did the same to the maintenance tracks
of a RP02.  The third just ran on the CPU creating and checking the patterns.
The processes were essentially just the interrupt routines, so the CPU
test kept getting interrupted.  The -10 never looked busier than when the
diagnostic was running, and turning off the computer room lights made it
even more impressive.  The RM10B, its controller (RC10) and channel (DF10)
ran through the patterns quickly, the RP02, its controller (RP10) and
DF10 did so more slowly.  The memory boxes jumped back and forth, sometimes
pausing as all the transfers went to other boxes, and CPU looked like it
was sweating, never sticking with any pattern for more than a fraction
of a second.

And it even found some memory errors, around the time we concluded that
some of the wires in the Ampex memory were failing due to turbulence from
the cooling fans.  Fortunately they were 16Kx20 core planes, so we had
some spare strings we could use before we had to get it completely
restrung.

From TOPS10's point of view, it did matter that BLISS was unmaintainable. 
BLISS-10 (the FORTRAN-10 compiler was written with this) had a bad bug; I
don't remember the specific details but I think it had to do with the use
bits being diddled with by that naughty compiler.  BLISS-10 was so
unmaintainable that TW agreed to "fix" the bug in the monitor rather than
force the maintainance group to distribute the real fix in BLISS-10.

Since I was the person who designed, spec'ed, and implemented the build
procedures on TOPS10 since 7.01,  I can assure you that all those pieces
that used any flavor in BLISS were a pain in the a--!  Since we
distributed sources (TOPS20 didn't so it didn't have as much of a
problem), I had to make sure that what the customer got on tape (the
binaries) was bit-for-bit identical if he decided to build it himself. 
The stuff written in BLISS was almost impossible to enforce this rule.

If to further confirm my packrat status, I still have a RP02 disk pack
at my parent's house. Intact as far as I know. I used it at Colgate
on their KA when I was a student there. I had Typeset-10 (aka itps)
on it (perhaps sources) which I used with a NEC Spinwriter (after
building the font tables -yuck) for term papers. Oh, I got it while
working summers in HOSS at MR1 (plenty of rp02 packs around when
everything was rp04's and 6's).

Long after John C left, the company's main timesharing system, a dual KI10,
was down there (between the salvage area and the Maynard sewer connection).
Lighting was fluourescent lights hanging from the ceiling (essentially cheap
shop lights without reflectors).  One day, a Telco person was stringing new
TTY cables.  He'd toss the cable over the lights, and tack it to the ceiling
later.  On one toss he dislodged a bulb which fell down on top of a RP04
(3?) drive's window.  The window didn't break, but the bulb shattered, of
course.

The Telco guy froze, suddenly aware that he may have done something Very
Bad.  I immediately took a couple steps to the drive to hit the off button,
but a field service person was closer and closing in too.  I figured the
positive pressure and window seals would have kept the glass shards out, but
with the pack inspector we saw half a dozen concentric scratches at various
radii.  While it wasn't one of our permanently mounted file systems, it
often in use, and the OS immediately start complaining that it could no
longer talk to the drive.

Never saw that particular Telco guy again.

I was one of the systems programmers at Stevens from 1970-1974, and I can
assure you that the FHA on KA system 101 was an RD-10 Burroughs fixed
head disk. Ah, how many times did I watch the fiendish service people replace
heads on that beast . . . I think I even still have one of the bad heads in a box
somewhere with the rest of my PDP-10 memorabilia.

One thing I donated to Stevens that I now wish I had taken with me is the
NUL-10, which as you may remember sat on top of the TD-10 (DECTape
controller). It would spell out "TILT" in its lights when it lost power, and
randomly flashed the lights when it had power. It was made of a genuine
TD-10 faceplate with neon bulbs populating the indicators, and had enough
lights to be interesting. One of the F.E.s gave me the TD-10 faceplate
because of a standing joke I had about building a broken PDP-10! I'd collect
all the bad parts they extracted from the system that they would have thrown
out, and to this day I'm still working on it . . .

/evs

p.s. The real "name" of the RD-10 at Stevens in my days there was GLZX - its
unit name on the system. Of course, it had to be GLZX II, since the original GLZX
was on system #2 in Maynard.

Suggest you NEVER power down a Burroughs disk unless absolutely
necessary!

Never saw one move; of course the mill had unfinished hardwood floors
and things tended to adhere to the linseed oil muck :-) Now the RP02
on the other hand ...

RCA was also a Memorex 660 customer. One of their diagnostic
programmers with time on his hands wrote a diagnostic that would make
one of them walk across the floor.

I hope that somebody saved my SPR on having NIN% and NOUT% support

by corresponding support in MacLisp.

DEC did promise that it would be implemented in TOPS-20 at about the time
that the sun novas.  Hmm, I guess they'll be putting in that fix to make
time be a doubleword.  Gotta get that in before August 7, 2576 (at
midnight UTC on August 8, the clock will run out)...

Yep; I think we had two of each.  (And once field service allegedly
cannibalized a seek board out of the drum's controller for the controller for
the 2 RP02's and 2 RP03's - "the drum didn't need it").

The controllers were moved from KA101 to KL1282.  There's a picture of me in
one or more college catalogs showing me with a box open (an RC10?).  I'm
showing one of the student operators the "write headers" (?) toggle switch
inside, which was only used for formatting packs.  It's a good joke, because
I'm sure "timesharing was up" when they took the photo, and if I'd touched it
I presume all hell would have broken loose.

>Actually, the RM10B (bryant drum) was also anchorworthy...

Stevens sold theirs to Princeton after we got the KL. One of our physics
professors was doing some experiments there, and had some use for it.

Anyone have the text of the famous MOUNTR SPR (and its reply) online?  This

not "one of your ace programmers."

I have a box with bunches of old TOPS stuff in it, will look and see if 
it has the dispatches.  ALso have tons of fiche (we fiched and filmed 
everything in sight as we were closing down LCG), which might include 
dome dispatch issues.  The 20th Anniversary celebration had a discussion

There is a story about something like this in the Hackers' Dictionary.
Apparently Guy Steele (?) found a mysterious two-position switch that
someone had hacked onto one of the AI PDP-10's.  One position was
labelled "magic", and the other position was labelled "more magic".
The switch was set to "more magic" when he found it.  I don't remember
the details but he traced the wires going into the switch and it
appeared to not go anywhere, so he flipped it, and the computer
instantly crashed.  He called over one of the hardware people, who
traced the wire and determined that the switch could not possibly do
anything, so the hardware person flipped the switch and the computer
crashed again!  He then diked out the switch and everything ran fine.
Anyone know the full story?

Also, the KL has no memory - if someone can find me an MG10 or similar

One of the stories of the PDP-10 Adventure game.....
It essentially stopped monitor development for a few days.   There were
programmers who played this game for at least 3 days non-stop, night and
day, all weekend.  The game was completed with the exception of 1 point. 
Now these monitor developers don't f.... around.   To be a monitor
developer, one needs that kind of curiosity that refuses to be quenched
until all questions of a particular aspect  are answered.  The game wasn't
complete until that last point was scored and there was nothing obvious
about where the point came from. Solution?  Set address break; and that's
how they found the last point.   Jim was amused for at least a week when
he heard 1) how long these people played with no sleep and 2) how they
finally solved the last point problem.  I don't remember who all played
that weekend but maybe someone who did  can expand on the story since my
info is second-hand.

The original Crowther & Woods Adventure game has been ported many, many times, I 
am sure. I have a FORTRAN listing for a Data General Eclipse version. However, I 
feel *very* sure that the *first* C & W Adventure was written on a PDP-10. 
According to the book _Hackers_ by Steven Levy, it was written at the Stanford 
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and placed on a PDP-10 there.

There is a Colossal Cave Adventure page on the WEB. It's at:

                http://www.winternet.com/~radams/adventure/

There is a short description there of the origins of the original Adventure.

Finally, the Jargon file also says that the original Adventure was implemented on 
a PDP-10.  (Yeah, I *know* there are lots of errors in the Jargon file, but it is 
just *one* more confirmation.)

Since I seem to have originated this sub-thread, let me put in my two cents 
worth. I'm relying solely on memory which tends to be fallible (see above: 
the dwarf 'vanishes', not 'disappears') but my best recollection is that 
ADVENT.EXE first appeared on the PDP-10s at ADP (the old First Data in 
Waltham, Mass.) in 1977. It was an incomplete version which only had about 
250 points worth of treasure. I seem to recall that there was nothing past 
the troll bridge but an 'under construction' sign or some such. I believe our 
copy came from WPI, but word at the time was it was developed at Stanford. 
Two or three months later we got the full 350 point game.

There is an accurate recreation of the original game at 
http://tjwww.stanford.edu/adventure/. It is in reality an HTML front end to 
the BSD C source implementation, but seems faithful to the original FORTRAN 
implementation. An interesting sidelight is the guestbook page. The reactions 
of people who have no idea they are playing a part of computer game history 
are really amusing.

I have in my Cambridge garage some 8's and 11's, a 12, a 15 (xvm), a
KL and two 2020's. I have fairly complete docs for KL, if anyone can
make better use of them than I (I have 2 problems - no 3-phase, no KL
memory!). If anyone can suggest the whereabouts of some KL memory or
(sigh) a complete KA or KI, I would be very interested...

Are you sure it was a DEC-20?  I don't think we ever sold a DEC-20 with
teletypes.  B.T.W. My definition of teletypes is an ASR-33.  My memories

Yes, Barb, the -35s were vastly superior to the -33s. I'd forgotten that 
there was an ASR-35, most of the ones we had at DEC were KSRs. I liked the 
-35 because of the tactile feedback you got from the keys when you typed, a 
feature missing from the -33. Remember the -37, the last (I think) of the 
Teletype brand terminals offered by DEC; 150 baud, upper/lower case? I don't 
believe many of them were delivered before DEC started making DECwriters, 
sometimes refered to as "Tom's Terrific Terminal" after Tom Stockebrand.

Jim's VT06 reminded me of the carpenter who had been using the same hammer 
for 35 years. Of course he had replaced the handle many times and the head a 
time or two. When I returned to DEC in 1977 to port TOPS-10 to the KS-10 I 
couldn't find a free VT06 and had to settle for a VT05. I recall they had an 
interesting problem that scrambled the screen from time to time. The 
"approved" fix was to lift the front of the terminal precisely one inch off 
the desk and let it drop. Cleared up the screen every time.

I certainly think all (or at least most) of us in the PDP-10 universe are old
enough to remember when the telling of risque stories was an acceptable way of
increasing the intimacy level of our friendships.  I have shortened the list to
just "our" newsgroup.

When I worked at Stanford, my boss and I were discussing some parameter changes
needed in the terminal initialization daemon, TTYINI.  As we blithely spoke of
TTY parameters and the like, the systems manager for the new IBM 4381s we had
been saddled with^W^Wgranted by Big Blue walked by, and did a massive double-
take.  She then burst out laughing, made motions in front of her chest with her
hands, and said "I kept twirling the knobs all night, but she never got any
better looking!"

We all got to be good friends in short order.

Ahhh. I had forgotten about the smell...Thanks for the reminder.   Which
reminds me...
My group, Tape Prep, had the job of editing the TOPS10 monitor every
Tuesday.
We would traipse upstairs from 12-1 to 3-5 to edit the marks that the
members
of the TOPS10 Monitor Group had made during the last week.  Then two guys
would take the edited sources and make all the various flavours of
monitors
that were needed to run for development, testing, etc.

The terminals we worked on were 35s.  There was a monitor guy who would
take
out his frustration on the poor 35s with the direct result of the windows
breaking.  One always knew if this man had been in the room by the
presence
of the glassless 35s.  Field Service finally got so fed up with the
hopeless
job replacing these windows, that they stopped.  As a result, whenever one
of
these 35s got serviced by a Field Service guy who was liberal with his
oilcan, one could get a waterless oil bath.   Just another hazard of the
mill
in those good ol' days.

Yup.  One of my more memoriable moments is the time I was editing
MONGEN.  I had a question (a compiling error, I think) and you were on
one side of me and Tom was on the other side.  Both of you were
arguing about what to do about it.  This argument went on for at least
15 minutes.  At any  moment I was expecting Tom to smash the terminal
(it still had the glass) but I knew he would miss it and get me
because my head was higher than the terminal.  I couldn't get out of
the way because of how you two were positioned around my chair.  
Monitor guys sure had their eccentricities.

avoiding fire. Also, be prepared to replace the oil-filled caps in the

OPERATING SYSTEM        VERSION PROGRAM         DATE
TOPS-20                 4(3417) AUTOPATCH       13-APR-82

KEITH LANE
KEPLINGER COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.
HOUSTON TEXAS

I have just completed applying autopatch 1 and 2 to the
Monitor and EXEC.

Why Autopatch?

I sure used a lot of disk space, CPU time and my time to
obtain an updated MOnitor and Exec.  Why couldn't you just
have put the updated .EXE files on the tape.

Why can't these components be put on an update tape?

Why can't I apply an .SPR DDT patch(s) to the autopatched
components?



========= PROPOSED SPR ANSWER ========

        Thank you for your SPR on Autopatch.   We regret the
fact that you were disappointed by having to spend so much
time rebuilding the Monitor and EXEC.  Better you than us.
You only have to rebuild a single version of the Monitor -
we would have to build fifteen of the suckers!  We have
better things to do with our resources, so if you don't want
to rebuild the programs, forget it!  The resulting files
will only be a disappointment to you in any event.  One of
the reasons that we don't build the products is that we
don't need them.  We certainly don't use them; we use stuff
that is even worse.

        And you pointed out that you used a lot of disk
space.  Yes, we planned it that way.  We had a surplus of
disk drives lying aroumd, and we all got together to decide
how to get rid of them.  Autopatch seemed to do the trick.
That's one of the reasons we decided to send it to all the
customer base, to sell more drives!

        And now about all that CPU time you spent building
your programs. Thank your lucky stars that you have a 2060;
the 2020 customers usually suffer several crashes while
building since it takes so long.  This was in keeping with
our plans to upgrade the 2020 customers to 2060s.  We
figured that if they got discouraged enough by building our
software every few months that they would HAVE to upgrade
just to get any useful work done!

        You suggested that we put the updated components on
an update tape. Too easy for all of our guys.  If we have to
suffer with trying to get together these products, you are
going to have to suffer some too. Several of the maintainers
have gotten so sick of it all that they even discourage
customers from buying the service.  They figure that if no
one buys the service that they will not have to keep
cranking out all these tapes.

        Finally, you inquired as to why the DDT patches
cannot be applied to the Autopatch components.  We planned
it that way.  Since the patches stand about a 75% chance of
doing harm to your system, we figured that we should patch
against a version that you can never duplicate.  That way
you will never figure out how to get it installed.  Some
customers actually have figured it out in some cases - boy,
were they sorry!

        We hope that this answers all your questions
regarding the Autopatch service.  We look forward to a long,
happy relationship...

    Ah yes, paper tape.  Recall that on the earlier PDP-1s, there was
    no disk, no magtape, no network/floppy/etc/etc.  Paper tape and
    the console typewriter were IT for 'permanent' storage output.  Of
    those two, only paper tape could also be read back into the
    computer, so it was the preferred medium.

    Off-line paper tape preparation was done on Frieden Flexowriters,
    heavy, noisy, electric typewrite-like devices with paper tape
    reader and punch.  As one might guess, correcting typing errors on
    paper tape was a challenge.  Restuffing the holes*, although not
    absolutely impossible, was difficult enough that it was done in
    only the most extreme of circumstances.  (It really was.  Honest.)
    More commonly, one would manually back the tape up to the
    offending frame and punch an additional hole or holes that would
    cause the frame to be ignored.  (On the PDP-1, a hole in the
    seventh column had this effect.  On teletypes, all holes were
    punched thus producing the RUBOUT character.)  Of course, if your
    one-character error was several frames back, you'd probably have
    to delete all intervening frames and retype from the point of the
    error to (hopefully) get things right.

    The Flexowriters also had the ability to nanofanfold the tape.
    Microfanfold is what you got from the high-speed readers on the
    PDP-1/6/10 if the tape stopped folding correctly.  Nanofanfold
    could be produced by getting the tape stuck in the Flexo's reader
    or punch.  The uninitiated might call it "crumpled", but we knew
    better.
    
    
    dlm


    * - Skeptics beware.  This really can be done, generally with the
    help of some Scotch(tm) tape.  Note, however, that what you could
    do depended on what would later read the tape.  The high-speed
    readers on the computer were optical, so a hole with reasonably
    clear Scotch(tm) tape over it would still be read as a hole.  The
    readers on the Flexos were mechanical, however, and a small, metal
    finger had to be able to pass through the plane of the tape in
    order for the device to consider it a hole.  These points had to
    be kept in mind when repairing ripped, snagged, torn, and
    mutilated paper tapes also.  Still, it's a long time since we've
    had a medium that could be read by a human being without the aid
    of any machine.

On the other hand, I remember a tour of the mill organized by the
MIT student IEEE chapter, I think it was, some time around 1968,
at which the official DEC tour guide showed us the semi-automatic
wire-wrap machines ("semi-automatic" meaning that the machine
positioned itself to the right pin, but a human being had to do
the actual wrapping) and proudly told us, "We hire women to run
these machines because they can tolerate the repetitive work
better."  :-(

Hmm.  At least you still have the cards.  I remember once after a six
hour marathon programming session overwriting my code with the JCL that
would have compiled it.  ("Yes of course I'm sure", I told the editor.)
Poof.  All gone.  Sigh.

If it had been tops20, I'd have still had the previous versions.  I wonder
why that hasn't made it into a "modern (popular) operating system"...

Well, this is certainly getting off-topic for alt.sys.pdp10, but the
'end of the deck' bit was very common on IBM (gasp!) 1401 object decks.
Many shops severly restricted availability for compiles, so programs
were 'maintained' by patching the object deck (yes, the output of the
compiler was a card deck), and nice programmers would add the patch to
the end of the deck, which overlaid the original code, rather than
replace the original card.  It was much easier then to read the original
program listing and figure out what it did with the patches.

Hmm.  I always put the stripe(s) on the top of the deck.  

A couple of stories (secondhand, of course) about 'dropped' cards.

1)  At a telephone office, a clerk pushing a cart with about 30 trays of
cards which had just gone through an 18 hour EAM sort (this was the old,
old, days) decided to race somebody, and tipped the cart over.  His
advancement opportunities became severly limited.

2) While a large job was being read, the operator casually asked the
programmer who was chatting with him if the job included a copy to tape.
When the programmer indicated that it did, he asked 'Why'?.  The
operator directed his attention to the card reader, on which he had
forgotten to install the proper mechanism to catch the cards, and the
cards were spewing out of the machine  onto the floor.  The programmer
stood quietly, finger crossed, until the copy to tape task completed.

*MUCH* more disconcerting is one that actually happened to me.  We had a
RJE terminal, that was 'self-serve'.  One fine day, I stuck a deck of 
about 550 cards in the input hopper.  did the appropriate incantations
and hit the LOAD butten. Fpppppptttt... the cards started disappearing 
from the input hopper.  *NOTHING* shows up on the output side.  The
-entire- deck disappeared into the machine. (the internal path was
approximately -three- cards long.)  I hunted up operations asd reported
"The _______ ate my deck".  got a dis-believing look. (like 'why are
-you- bothering us with _that_?'  I was well known to them, as one of
the few people who, when an 029 keypunch was misbehaving, it was "ok
to just give him the toolbox", and let me fix it. usually quicker than
they could get to it. :)     Anyway, th ops _manager_ comes out to
see what the problem is. opens up the chassis of the RJE reader.  We
-both- break up laughing.  *All* the free space inside the box is -full-
of crumpled up punch-cards.  _somebody_ hadn't put one of the cover-
plates back down on the card-path.  So, -zip-, they come flying down
the track, hit the 'open' space, and went all over *everywhere*.  the
-only- thing to do was grab the garbage can, and start raking stuff
into it.

It -was- a relatively small deck, thank goodness.  Even better, the
-only- thing the job was doing was 'copy input to disk'. and things
were flying around _after_ they'd been under the read head.  Good
thing, too.  something like -seven- of the cards were recovered in
'useable' condition.

Talk about geek bracelets.  Well, Barb always WAS a skinny chick.

Heh heh heh... I've come up with a LOT of creative ways to use computer
equipment. By far the weirdest was when I got 4 defective core stacks
[forget what from], and sewed them together into an interesting
"bracelet"... I also pulled lots of pranks, including placing a dead 486
chip, pin-side-up, into my roommate's shoe...

I was following another thread and found the other reference to tape seals
there.  Yep, before I got married I had eating habits which left my waist
at 33 inches.

I blame Dawn Banks for that bit of sillyness.  At CSM, she mentioned that a
tape seal was about the right size for a belt, which meant that I had to
do that for the next DECUS.

We had a guy do that at the Colorado School of Mines.  And it was FORTRAN.

The trick is trivial once you realize that PDP-10 FORTRAN allows multiple
statements to punched on a single card, separated by semicolons.
Each card had a line number, and each one ended with ";GOTO NNN".

As long as the first card was first and the END card was last, the remaining
cards sould be shuffled and the program ran correctly.

I remember a few things about paper tape from college.

First, we had a minicomputer in our lab with nothing but an ASR-33.  The 
BASIC interpreter took at least 30 minutes to load via non fan-fold paper 
tape.  We had an old record player rigged up to rewind the tape onto a 
spool after the program was loaded.  Luckily, the machine had 
honest-to-goodness magnetic core, so the interpreter would remain in 
memory through power cycles, and we didn't have to reload too often.

Second: The output of the optical paper tape reader on our KI-10 could be 
conveniently aimed at a waste basket.  Good for reading results from our 
spectrometer paper tape onto disk. (Before the days of direct 
computer-instrument interfacing.)

Third: The chaff (?) from the punch made great confetti, and was VERY 
hard to remove.  I think my old prof still has a few bits stuck in his 
desk drawers from a prank 25 years ago.

Punch cards:  I hated 'em, and would still be a chemist today if that's 
all I'd had.  But they were wonderfully tactile.  I remember writing a 
program to display a card image on a VT100.  As you typed a line of text, 
black punches would appear on a video-reversed white screen.  Stole the 
-029 lookup table from some TOPS-10 sources to get the punch patterns 
right.  Never did simulate the punches drifting downwards into little 
piles at the bottom of the screen, though.

My *hate* of punch cards (and *one* of the reasons I dropped out of
programming and took up journalism) was that, in 1974 we had two main
computers at the State U. of NY at Stony Brook,  a 370 and a KA-10.

Coming off three years of KA-10 experience, I took on Comp. Sci. 101 and asked
for an account on the '10 - and was ordered by my prof to do all my work on
the 370, cutting mt cards like all the other freshmen in the room containing
45 zero-feedback keypunches - using field-sensitive ALGOL.

Spoke to Bruce Maier, then living one dorm over and managing the LIRICS-10
through a DECWriter II. No problem.

Except with the professor.

Who didn't believe in timesharing.

Or any language except ALGOL, specifically as writ for an IBM mainframe by his
professor in his undergrad days, and his requirement that everything be
submitted *on* punch cards *with* the sheets resulting from the batch run from
the 370.

The next year, SUNY @SB decided to scrap both the IBM and the KA-10 for a
UNIVAC. The head of the selection team was hired by UNIVAC six months later.

Oh, I kept up with *some* computer work, occasionally dropping by LIRICS,  and
finding the odd 12 or 18-bit machine squirrel led away (like the second of the
two LINAC PDP-9s  that was used extensively to test and retest DECUS
kaleidoscope routines while the 128x128 ADC on the other machine collected
data.

Later a PDP-8 unused for years would disappear from an engineering lab only to
reappear in a dorm room running MIT Chess and spark local competition  for the
best "electronic fireplace" programs capable of simulating the closest thing
to "fire" on the front panel lights.

    As I recall, both groups usually referred to their respective OS
    as simply "the Monitor".  And virtually nobody called TOPS-10 by
    that name until TOPS-20 came along and the distinction had to be
    made.

    So were we.  We were quite amazed that dozens of highly paid and
    therefore extremely capable marketing managers and vice presidents
    could labor and contemplate for weeks and come up with something
    that creative.  I could never have done that.  I guess that's why
    I'm (still) an engineer.

    As to the sources, it's interesting to note that sources were
    shipped with TOPS-10 as normal practice.  When TOPS-20 came along,
    those selfsame managers and vice presidents decided we had to do
    things the modern, businesslike way (read: like IBM) and NOT ship
    sources.  However, TOPS-10 continued to ship them, at least as for
    as long as I recall.

    I'm quite convinced that the real bottom line on all this is that
    nobody at DEC knows enough to deal with this, and they wouldn't be
    willing to bother if they did.  For similar reasons, I doubt DEC
    would go after anyone who had the sources and used them, even for
    commercial purposes, provided a few simple precautions were taken,
    e.g. removing DEC's names and trademarks.  Of course, I'm neither
    a lawyer nor a representative of DEC, so I take no responsibility
    for what happens if you try it.

Oops!  Orange is the color of arch-rival U of Texas.  They had to send out

Ouch! :-( Hopefully your foot will feel much better real soon.
Nothing too seriously wrong, I hope.

Ermmm... If you get desparate, you might want to try my quick-fix
method for temporarily releiving foot pain: get someone to stomp on
the other foot (but not hard enough to really do any damage), thus
taking your mind off of the other foot. :-) This pain-relief method
works for fingers, arms, etc. as well.  WARNING: try this at your own
risk!  For some odd reason, some people don't like to follow my advice
about this method of pain relief.

Hopefully none of the remaining systems will end up being scrapped.
One thing that might help is for some people to make telephone calls
to scrap-metal dealers, such as those who advertise in The Processor.
Can someone post a good visual description of these systems?  

I almost had some success in saving some PERQ workstations this way.
Unfortunately, the one scrap dealer that was familiar with PERQs, and
who was expecting a shipment of them to arrive, discovered that the
PERQs were crushed before he received them.  Apparently some companies
and government agencies destroy equipment before sending it to scrap
dealers.

>>and some of us might be up for a mission to save and 10 or two or three 
>>and give them homes...

I'd be willing to help with this. :-) I'll try to put together a list
of scrap dealers and make a few calls.  Out of curiosity, has anyone
been able to save any systems, or any type, from local scrap dealers?

Note that I've added a computer humor archive to my ftp'able files,
extracted from files in Anthony A. Datri's (huge) humor archive, which
he kindly geve me permission to make available.  There's some folklore

As I recall, when Stevens bought KL1282 and got rid of KA101, we had to juggle
some racks to accomodate the 2nd DECtape controller (DTB[0-3]:), etc.  We made
a custom-sized door for some of the front of the rack by hacksawing a taller
door down to size, and the taller door did not come in core-box blue.  So, DEC
sold (or gave) Stevens a 12-can case of official core-box-blue spray paint.

I've wondered from time to time where the other 11.99 cans of paint went, and
what's been painted with it.

Well, it's almost Halloween, and Stephan Wolfe is probably out with one
or two of those cans painting pumpkins blue again.

Hi Bill...

(*sigh*) Ah! LIRICS! Wow ...what a blast of memories!!

That's where/how I got my first taste of a PDP-10.  In fact, its what
causes me to lust afer owning one personally (and the root of my
friend Steve Jones' <smj@crash.com> inquiries about 2020's in this
group -- he's into "the classics" too).

An old (and unfortunately long gone) mentor by the name of Steve
Wandell got me hooked on Macro36 back in 1977.  I learned TECO with
that tutorial system -- as well as ALGOL.  I think I have paper copies
of some of the TECO and ALGOL lessons on TTY paper in a box
somewhere... I still have the DECSystem-10 System Reference Manual on
my bookshelves (rebound into a hardcover form by the LIRICS folk).
One of my most prized computer memorobelia posessions!  

After he passed away I got to spend quite a lot of time at the LIRICS
data center cleaning up his accounts and actually having close
encounters of the 3rd kind with the '10.  

I wonder what happened to that beautiful old machine... I rememebr
that they had aquired five 20's by 1981... I wonder if they're still
alive somewhere.  I wonder what Jerry Damm (ex-DEC guy who ran LIRICS)
is up to these days...
