DEC did learn from the DATE75 problem.  The internal VMS representation
of time works until 31-JUL-31086 02:48:05.47.  The problem with
19-May-1997 is that some C programmers like to know the number of
days from 1-Jan-1970 (the Unix base time).  To do this, these
programmers used some "Delta-time" routines that are part of the
VMS system libraries.  These delta-time routines have a maximum of 9999
days difference built in to them, and this maximum was well documented 
in the library manuals.  Nevertheless, application programmers
tended to ignore this restriction and use the delta-time routines
anyway.  Recently, some optional components of OpenVMS (such as the
Security Server) were written in C and would suffer from the same
problems, so this delta-time trap was more insidious than just affecting
third-party applications.

DEC, in order to step around this problem, has released patched
delta-time routines which no longer have the original documented 9999
day limit.  As a result, application programs written in C which
calculate delta-times from 1-Jan-1970 will continue to work properly
after the patch is applied, despite the fact that the application
programmers blissfully ignored the documented restrictions.

The 9999-day limit on delta times had always existed.  It's just
that the proliferation of programs which like to know the number of
days since the Unix base time is now the largest abuser of this limit.
Before 19-May-1997, you'd encounter exactly the same problems if
you tried to calculate the delta-time between any two dates more than
9999 days apart.
