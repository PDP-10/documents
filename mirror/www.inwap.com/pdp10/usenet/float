No indeed, Alpha's math library is just about the best around.  I haven't
studied it
in detail but it might be *the* best.  (IBM is awfully good at it too.)

There was a series of articles in Transactions on Mathematical Software that
showed
clear signs of somebody disassembling the Vax codes and figuring out the cool
tricks.
I think his funding ran out before he got to the good part though.  (That being
pow().)

On the original topic, I had some tests for gfloat but they're lost.  But
there's
nothing surprising about PDP10 floating point semantics.  Rounds away from zero,
and if either operand is negative take the absolute value and later attach the
result sign.  (It need not be computed that way but that gives the right
answer.)
Round before checking for overflow/underflow, of course.  You can figure out
unnormalized operands from knowing what adding 233000000000 did (Fortran AINT or
ANINT, for FAD and FADR respectively).  Unnormalized operands to mul and div
were
possibly never used, and the various processors might have been different for
all
anybody would know.  I speculate -- very hazy -- the result was the same as 
normalizing the operands first.  An unnormalized denominator in div was allowed
to
or required to fault.

gfloat didn't have UFA et al -- getting those right without a real 10 would
indeed be tough.  And 400000000000 is not a useful f.p. number, but I forget
what
the hardware did with it.

That she did.  The basic trick is to end with A+(B+C)
where A is exact and B+C is much smaller.  Usually A
and C come from a table and B is the computed approximation.
B+C should be added with FAD, and A should be added in
with FADR.  I think Mary may be why IEEE, and Alpha, 
can do this -- she was irritated that Vax could not.

The Vax math lib is the real Mary Payne one.  The -10
one was written by IMSL, under the guidance of their
consultant W. Cody.  The book Cody & Waite was the
result of the 10 math lib rewrite.  Well, a corollary,
I don't know which was primary, but they got a book
out of it.

Cody's work was not always up to Mary's standard --
not many people's was -- and there were some ideas
of hers that they wouldn't adopt.  My favorite is
the Vax lib's pi table -- it stores 1/pi to a monstrous
number of bits, so if you want the sine of 1.234q+1234
it can subtract off exactly some enormous multiple of pi
and tell you.

power function, y**x.  Very hard to get both correct and fast.

Yep -- hi Barb -- normally I post as Myself but not to
alt groups, my normal news setup doesn't.  Hence this
foolish what-you-see-is-not-what-you-think newsreader
etc.
