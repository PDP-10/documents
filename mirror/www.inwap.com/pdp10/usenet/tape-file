 I don't know if it's documented anywhere, but it's very simple: An
 AWSTAPE file consists of blocks of data, preceded by a block header of
 6 bytes. Each block corresponds to a block on the tape. The block
 header is defined as:

 /*-------------------------------------------------------------------*/
 /* Structure definition for AWSTAPE block header                    */
 /*-------------------------------------------------------------------*/
 typedef struct _AWSTAPE_BLKHDR {
         HWORD  curblkl;                /* Length of this block      */
         HWORD  prvblkl;                /* Length of previous block  */
         BYTE    flags1;                /* Flags byte 1              */
         BYTE    flags2;                /* Flags byte 2              */
 } AWSTAPE_BLKHDR;
                                                                          
 /* Definitions for AWSTAPE_BLKHDR flags byte 1 */
 #define AWSTAPE_FLAG1_NEWREC    0x80    /* Start of new record      */
 #define AWSTAPE_FLAG1_TAPEMARK  0x40    /* Tape mark                */
 #define AWSTAPE_FLAG1_ENDREC    0x20    /* End of record            */

 The two HWORD values are 16-bit little-endian integers. curblkl is the
 length of the block described by this block header; prvblkl is the
 length of the immediately preceding block, and is set to zero for the
 first block on the tape. Data records are a maximum of 65535 bytes
 long; longer records on tape are segmented, with the NEWREC and ENDREC
 flags denoting the first and last segments. A record of less than 65535
 bytes has both the NEWREC and ENDREC flags set. A tapemark is denoted
 by a current length of zero and the TAPEMARK flag set (but not the
 NEWREC or ENDREC flags).

 Does that cover the bases? I'm guessing at the function of the NEWREC
 and ENDREC flags; since an IBM tape can only have 65535 bytes in a
 record, I've never seen the case where segmentation is needed (and the
 Hercules tapecopy program, used to create AWSTAPE files from real
 tapes, is hardcoded to set both flags on data records because of this).

 For further details, look at the tapecopy, tapemap, and tapesplit
 utilities in the Hercules package. I whipped up tapemap and tapesplit
 in a couple of hours after looking at tapecopy for a bit, so it can't
 be that hard.

Actually, I believe you could write tape records longer than 64K by using
the Chain Data flag in the CCWs.  3420s probably didn't care how much
data they were asked to write, but there might have been problems on the
buffered Control Units like the 3480.  Back in 1994, I wrote a program 
that would create an AWSTAPE file under VM.  The following is a portion
of the code that delt with writing tape records.  It is written in IBM's
Pascal/VS compiler.

Const
   Min_Tape_RSize = 4005;
   Max_Tape_RSize = 65535;
   Def_Tape_RSize = 4005;
   Min_Tape_DSize = 1;
   Max_Tape_DSize = 4096;
   Def_Tape_DSize = 4096;
   Min_Tape_BSize = 1;
   Max_Tape_BSize = 65535;
   Def_Tape_BSize = 4096;
   VMFPLC2_Tag_Size = 5;
   VMFPLC2_Header_Tag = '02'XC||'PLCH';
   VMFPLC2_Data_Tag = '02'XC||'PLCD';
   VMFPLC2_Blk_Size = 800;
   VMFPLC2_Max_Blks = 5;
   FST_Ext_Size = '18'X;
   Old_FST_Size = L_FST_Rec - FST_Ext_Size;

Type
   Tape_Header_Rec = Record
      THR_Size: Half_Word;
      THR_PSize: Half_Word;
      THR_Flags: Half_Word;
      End;

Const

{ ======================
   THR_Flags constants.
  ====================== }

   THRF_NewRec = '8000'X;
   THRF_EOF    = '4000'X;
   THRF_EndRec = '2000'X;

   P_VMFPLC2_Tag = -> VMFPLC2_Tag;
   VMFPLC2_Tag = Packed array [1..VMFPLC2_Tag_Size] of Char;
   P_VMFPLC2_Data = -> VMFPLC2_Data;

Good question. I got called on that one not long after posting that; it
seems that I'd been thinking in terms of BSAM and QSAM, both of which have a
32K limit, and totally forgot things like geophysical tapes which can have
records in the hundreds of megabytes. At some point, I might update tapecopy
to handle segmenting records, but it'd be nice to see an example of a file
with long records before doing that.
