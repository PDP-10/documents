You are telling me that IT WAS ALL YOUR FAULT!
Now that I have you attention, I should explain<G>.
Many years ago, a DecSystem-10 was the first
computer that I, personally, was ever responsible
for purchasing. Not that I paid for it out-of-pocket,
but I was the techy who basically made the choice.

It was CPU#14, if I remember rightly, and it was installed
in Toronto ... about the fourth or fifth 10 in Canada and
the first commercial one ... the others were all universities
or government.

After putting it in, the very first program I ended up writing
for it was a program to analyse all that data you put out. If
I remember rightly, it was a total hodge-podge of miscellaneous
figures, each one in a completely different format ... does
that sound about right?

That's the way I remember it. I do recall being shown a dump from the
old style accounting information showing that "magically" the cty had
migrated to my terminal and that various other unauthorized actions had
occured (in my absence of course :-). I was only a part-time student 
operator and wasn't supposed to understand or use a priviledged account...

Yup.  Those files were called FACT files.  I got really
good at "fixing" them using FILDDT.  The reason the USAGE
files were so damn controversial is that we switched the data
type to all ASCII.  What a hullaballoo.  See.  In order to
bill computer usage, the computing center had to hire a systems
programmer just to deal with the raw data.  After our implementation,
a COBOL programmer could be hired (at 1/3 the salary) to do the
programming.  The managers of these systems programmers quietly
took us aside and thanked us because the managers would rather
put their systems programmers to better use.

Actually, it was so long ago, that I do not remember that much about
it.  I think I wrote a macro-10 program to convert it all to flat ASCII,
then a Cobol program to analyse it.  I seem to remember timestamps
and stuff as 36 bit numbers.  Long time ago, now.

I dunno about TOPS-20, but the sort-of-TOPS-10 system at the Stanford
AI Lab had intra-line editing built into the keyboard scanner in the
monitor (so available in all programs), and around 1976 Martin Frost
and I hacked that code into an otherwise normal TOPS-10 system at
L'Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique in Paris.

IIRC, the "standard" stanford (?) exec extensions included history and the
ability to access the history with emacs-like commands (^P, ^N), but NOT the
ability to do intra-line editing with emacs-like commands.  Trying to mix
intra-line editting (or any kind of single-character wakeup) with COMND%
would have been challanging.  I can think of a few different ways to try it
that I didn't think of last time (my first big tops20 project - port SAIL's
news system to tops20.  NS had this parser where some commands would act on
a single keystroke, while others let you type a whole line (with editting
being desirable.)  I don't think I'd use COMND% at all if I had to do that
again, come to think of it.)

I recall the EXECs at Rutgers had optional editing within single lines (both
EMACS and something else).  So did some other site's EXEC (some doc
differences - possibly a different implementation).  I don't know what site(s)
wrote the code, vs. who were recipients from elsewhere.

As I recall, a friend hacked ITS TECO-20 (and therefore MIT EMACS) at DEC
Marlboro to use TEXTI% for input.  Under normal conditions it set the break
mask to anything that wasn't self-inserting, and messed with the control
character output control word (CCOC).  This was partially an experiment to
reduce per-character wakeups of the user code.

Ah, here's where at least one version (which supported EMACS and SOS Alter
mode) came from:

"

I'm told that the TECO work was done at MIT, not DEC, but that it depended on
adding an echo flag to TEXTI's interface.

    I'm told that the TECO work was done at MIT, not DEC, but that 
    it depended on adding an echo flag to TEXTI's interface.

I think Stanford again (or perhaps also.)  That particular hack (the
stanford version) was one of mine (the trick was not to echo characters
that were in the break set.)

I don't know that we were ever able to tell whether it made much of a
difference - there seemed to be subjective improvement in overall system
performance, but getting stats to prove better performance was difficult.

Depends on what you call "all".  Certainly, most of the
TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 tapes are available by anonymous
FTP from xkleten.paulallen.com - just cd to PS:<DECUS>
and start browsing!

Be aware that many (most?) Unix- and Windows-based FTP
clients lack support for 36-bit-specific transfers.  Seems
a shame - especially as just a few years ago all the major
FTP sites were PDP-10's.  In addition, some Windows-based
FTP clients won't let you use "<" and ">" as directory
delimiters.

Yes, the picture is of a KI10 and not a KL10.  If you look carefully, you
can see the paper tape reader on top of the console!

I don't know when it first appeared, but it was in use on the PDP-6
by 1966, according to a table in the Proceedings of the Australian
Computer Conference (p. 251) from that year.  Wasn't the PDP-5 the
first DEC computer to use ASCII?

The original (pre-lowercase) ASCII standard defines ^U as "error,"
which makes more sense than the "NAK" that replaced it in the revised
standard.

Hmm, I have a rather interesting take on the situation, based on some
experiences that would push things up a level higher than sales.

Mangement - "new" management.

Things didn't seem to go badly wrong for DEC until the Defenestration of Olsen
& Co.

OK, Ken *should* have realized that the market was changing when people were
making off with officially obsolete low-number PDPs as "home computers" but it
was the *new* (then would-be) management that seemed to be behind things like
making the company a one-computer-line-fits-all outfit, cutting back research
and development (early kills included Jupiter and the Trilogy consortium after
the initial project turned into the Big Flame) getting the IRS to nuke one of
the company's (and Ken and the Bells') most expensive and wonderful projects -
the original Digital Computer Museum at Marlborough (IRS denied the project
501(c)3 educational not-for-profit status on the grounds it was a company
lobby, rather than the company donating hundreds of thousands of dollars in
time, space and equipment in a situation that only created headaches - I
suspect after an *inside* complaint though I have absolutely no evidence - we
do know that Gordon Bell went soon after the Defenestration, the historic
collection was tossed out of Boston, and both ended up on the Left Coast)

The "old" DEC gave away manuals and created the engine to give away software,
had a multi-platform line with gear to suit everyone's needs (from 12- to
36-bits + modules and industrial controllers) had folks who were ready to drop
anything to provide customers with service and a sense of humor.

The "new" DEC became a better-dressed IBM with a narrower line of products and
customer loyalty to the product.

Sorry, but the God Bless America stuff allowed a few greedy people to destroy
a great company that should have had some protection - and the greedheads
ended up making out best.

I was working for DEC as an engineer on DECsystem10's and 20's for over 9 
nine years through the 80s.

Being a Large Computer Group (LCG) engineer was like being a member of an
elite.  We had to know the software, we had much closer relationships with
the customers and we went to the States to be trained.  We got to see the
museum, both when it was in the Marlboro plant and when it moved to the
wharf in Boston.

After the 10's demise, things went downhill fast in DEC.  The engineer's job
was deskilled to the point where you were just the last link in the
logistics chain, so I moved off into project management and services sales.
Every quarter some new remedy was going to put the company back in shape,
but it never worked.  I eventually left with around 2000 other UK employees
in the April '94 "Night of the long knives".  Worries about the future were
tempered with a great feeling of a weight being lifted.

Alpha was going to save the day, of course.  But nobody seemed to catch on
the fact that customers need more than hot technology.  Unix and NT became
flavours of the month, but a customer is moving from VMS or Tops to Unix or
NT, choosing the box it runs on the one of the least considerations.  The
impression I get is that they still haven't figured that out.  And now
Compaq seems to be going the same way.

I remember when this industry was fun.  It stopped being that way for me the
day the 10s/20s died.

<snip>

There is a juggling act involved with this, though.  There were
many times that a customer would come to us with his "solution"
which wouldn't work for a general distribution.  Most of the
time, a customer was solving a symptom rather than the real
problem.  After all, a particular customer only has the
experience of his site; we had the experience of all sites
(that was our job).

On the other hand, Digital was not selling anything (from
our point of view).  Jim had customers (who knew him from
DECUS) calling him personally and begging him to just point 
them to a salesman that would cut the order.  There wasn't
any other way to buy hardware back then--one had to have
the salesman in those days to initiate paperwork.  We didn't get
orders until the mini sales force were allowed to sell PDP-10s.

No.  Those were the last.  Research was cut back in the early 70s
because the number crunchers insisted that it was more competitive
(other companies didn't have as high a percentage of earnings as
DEC did at that time--it was a side effect of being publicly owned).
And the beginnings of cancellations that were a mistake happened
in between 1977 and 1979--both hardware and software.

I didn't know that the museum went away because of the IRS.  But
I'll tell you, we viewed it as getting our noses rubbed in it.  
All that money being spent on a bloody museums instead of a 
decent CPU, peripherals or software.

His leaving was good news for us.  But, by then, it was too late.

No.  It wasn't greed that started it.  There do exist people
who have to destroy what others build.  If you want to
bring psychology into it, I would say it was jealousy.

The IRS was told by *someone* with a grudge that the museum should be stripped
of tax-exempt status because it served the benefit of a particular company not
the public good - this is an extremely rare action. I've been a reporter
covering outright charity fraud 501(c) cases for years and I only know of this
happening once, after I proved a guy (through his fund raising companies) was
making something like $100,000 for each 20 cents he turned over to the charity
he was allegedly operating - the charity itself, like the museum, retained
status after it was given to the duped organizers.

To DEC and other right-coast computer fans, the museum was Mecca, a revived
part of the old DEC spirit (see below) why we on the outside loved DEC -
though I can understand how it must have felt from the inside.

I never paid for a DEC manual until 1972, when the multi-color decsystem-10
software manuals appeared - and even then, company reps were fairly free at
giving them away to students. I had a long shelf of DEC information books
(unfortunately many given away) that were freebies, going back to the original
black hard-bound module catalog/use guide.

DEC was also free with "obsolete" hardware to both non-profits and individuals
through the '80s

DECUS provided the platform for free software distribution, while most basic
DEC software was "free" with the purchase of a machine (compare with IBM's
imfamous licences)

OK, as I said, I'm looking at this from an outsider's pov. My first experience
with the "new" DEC came in about 1981, when several DECfolks wanted to give
LIRICS (the LI high school project) a pair of KL-10s that had been sitting in
MR-1 or 2 (the one without the museum) and were about to be decommissioned.

DEC Service, Huntington, NY blew the deal because "the machines had not been
maintained by DEC Service since their installation" and refused to support.

The machines were scrapped because something that large couldn't be made to
fly out the door to a non-nfp like me. (I stood to inherit a KA, something,
which at the time, would have caused me great grief in the long run when my
parents saw the electric bills)

Well, there's more to the story than just the quote.  Bell
gave a speech that had that phrase in it.  The third and
fourth level of managers heard the speech but only listened
to the phrase and started implementing it.  The first we
(those in Marlboro which was the mainframe building) heard
of it was the decisions getting made based on that phrase.
Our manager got hold of the tape and we listened (or, at
least, I listened) to what Bell actually said.  Putting
the phrase back into the orginal context implied the 
exact opposite of what all those idiots were organizing,
namely, one operating system.  

Bell usually did say things that didn't really have anything
to do with how the business should be run.  However, up until
that time, people were sensible enough not to act on them.

I really don't know.  I still don't understand why limiting
R&D of a company is a big deal with major stockholders--
especially when they don't seem to blink an eyelid when
money is used to gild the lily.  

I don't even know if the stockholders had anything to do with
it; it could have just been the bean counters' rule learned
from idealisms found in text books.

After they started initiating talks, we didn't mind it (after all,
the museum was the one who brought in Grace Hopper).  And there
wasn't a lot of resentment w.r.t. that funding.  The resentment
got immense when we saw parking lots getting resurfaced that
weren't being used or weren't going to be used.  When Jim
worked in Littleton, he observed that a section of sidewalk was
ripped up and repoured five times...and this was when everybody
was getting laid off due to a need to watch expenditures.

Yup.  Jim always thought that he shouldn't have been a manager
and should have stayed an engineer.  But that was difficult to
do once personnel got into the act of classifying us.

Yea, we heard about that.  It went beyond our understanding
because we had the opionion that the engineers who designed
the thing probably knew just a tad more than those FS idiots
about the workings of those KLs (they were the ones who fixed
them).  Something happened to Field Service around 1980 w.r.t.
organization.  We (the PDP10 groups) stopped having a say in
their policies towards particular customers.  Somebody else
who was in the field or in that org can probably say more
about it since my info is based on just rumor and customer 
grumbling I took it as just another hint of where the company 
was going.

I used System #2 for all of my stand-alone time when I was

Confused - I was referring to the who-wants-a-home-computer line attributed to
KO, not the One computer line fits all, which is <imho> just so much crap. And
based on Bell's career work, he should have known it.

It's like the chronic debates in my work environment <a newspaper> over "which
computer system we should buy" meaning all-PC or all-MAC, etc., and having to
explain to the know-nothings that the photo and graphics folks will do better
with graphics-optimized machines like MACs, the writers probably want Wintel
machines because we share lots of MS-Office style files (Word, Access, etc.) +
it seems to be a better platform for net use than anything I've seen built to
run on a Mac, and the servers should be whatever animal works best for
connecting it all together and feeding the insane output devices we have (like
straight-to-litho film beasts)

Pathetic.

R&D does not produce guaranteed results, and even when successful, does not
figure in as "income"

Same in my business, the bean counters always look to cut reporters and
editors because all they do is take up the space in the paper that doesn't
generate advertising income. The fact that there would be no advertising
without the stuff that wraps around it is hard to get through their skulls,
along with the idea that the consumers won't read the ads unless they are
packaged between news they need/want.

When I was on the customer side of the biz, there were a limited
amount of manuals that went with the purchase of the mainframe.
After that, the manuals had to be purchased.  In my group, the
number of manuals were so few that only the top level of
programmers got access to them.  Of course, that could have been
a reason [not having enough manuals] given to me to keep me from
learning too much (I hadn't learned to question authority yet).
What they didn't know is that, in order to satisfy my thirst
for knowledge, I had already honed the skill of learning from
snippets of conversation and watching quietly :-).

I got a relatively complete set of manuals (everything I wanted, more or
less) at Wharton-10 for being somewhere between an operator and "jr systems
programmer."  Maybe they weren't "free", but they couldn't have been "scarce
as hen's teeth and priced like platinum" the way some of the equivilent
manuals were (and are) on other systems.

Yup.  There was that [who wants a home computer] muddled 
thinking going around, too.  It came from people who
didn't use computers for their everyday work.  I think
that a lot of the idiocy had to do with hardware types
not recognizing how computers were used.  I had a
conversation with a hardware type on evening about
SMP.  His opinion was that computers got shut off when
he went home at 17:00 and got turned on again when he
started work at 8:00 (even though those main frames ran
24x7).  I was explaining how the SMP implementation would
allow computer service to continue rather than be terminated.
He did not think that was necessary.  I then asked him if
he would tolerate an interuption of power whenever the
electric company wanted to take a turbine off line or 
put one on line.  I tried to get him to see that our
customers required the same quality of service.  Those
hardware types didn't have a clue about computer usage.

Even our in-house field service was on your side.  But for

(I was a software engineer in the LCG diagnostics,
VLSI CAD, and AI groups during these times.  I don't
know from financials.  LCG diagnostics loaned me to
the 11/750 for a few months when Dolphin died.
I was also one of the first few members of The
Computer Museum and a volunteer docent when it was
in Marlborough, and my wife worked in The Computer
Museum store part time.  There're my disclaimers.)

I think DEC was mostly a victim of its own success.
I agree with BAH's comments blaming MBAs and IBM
mimicry.

I don't think that Gordon Bell deserves so much of the
blame; he left relatively early in DEC's death spiral.
I realize that reducing the number of architectures was
an act on a par with mass murder in these circles.

Remember that he started GEEP to get engineers going
for graduate degrees to get an advanced engineering
degree and explicitly to discourage them getting an MBA.
He said that it was the MBAs who turned RCA from an inventor
of TV technology into an importer of Japanese TVs and
then it was left put it out in the cold when the Japanese
manufacturers started marketing TVs under their own names
in the US.  After he had a heart attack, I think he realized
that he didn't want to spend the rest of his life beating
his head against a brick wall trying to get things
done at DEC, so he left to help start Encore.

> > one-computer-line-fits-all
> That was Gordon Bell's mantra, by the way.

How many operating systems and FORTRAN compilers can
one company really afford to maintain?

DEC had 10 architectures, with word lengths of 1 [PDP-14],
8 [Intel 8008 based MPS], 12 [2: PDP-8 & LINC families],
16 [2: PDP-11 & PDP-16 families], 18, 32, and 36
[2: '10 & '20].  All (or almost all) of these were in use
at the same time.  Chaos!

With the 36-bit machines extending the range down and the
16/32-bit machines extending the range up, they started
overlapping a lot.  KS10 or 11/780?  Minnow or 11/730?
If you just want to count widgets in the warehouse,
odds are that it doesn't matter if it is a 36-bit or
32-bit word.

One academic paper on the PDP-11 design mentioned that
the word length for the machine had been chosen for DEC
by IBM to be a multiple of 8 bits -- IBM had convinced
the customers that memory was sold in multiples of 8 bits.
IBM switched from 36 to 32 and got many of the customers
out there to go along with switching to the 360 architecture.
Not all, but most.  There were even 360 architecture
mutation [to fit the specialized job] avionics computers.
And the semiconductor industry was going along with
8-bit-ism.  With today's technology, there wouldn't be a
problem, the whole CPU is on one chip, so it can have
as many bits in a word as you want.  But with
semiconductors in the '70s-'80s making 4-bit and 8-bit
RALUs and RAMs and ROMs and EPROMs, it wasn't easy to build
36-bit systems.  (I spent a lot of time with the KS10
print set; I know about the 40-bit ALU made from 10 4-bit
slices [with 2 spare bits hanging off of each side] so
that each half-word could be clocked separately.)
I have a cousin who works on antique steam cars.  They're
neat, but they just aren't the way the world went, and
not many people want the hassles of driving one to work
today.

The product lines caused proliferation that could be
dealt with as a small company where the customers knew
what they wanted, but (given KO's belief that people
would go manage themselves and do the right thing) (IMHO)
caused chaos in a large company with a very rapidly
growing manufacturing force and sales force and
maintainence force and customer base (and the growth
rate made training all of them difficult, with training
the customer's decision makers being the biggest problem).
DEC got way past the point where MOST of the customers
knew what they wanted to order.  Cost of sales reportedly
increased to the point where they couldn't afford
[maybe that's where the MBAs come into the picture, in part]
to cut a small (<Fortune 500) deal.  They didn't get into
developing microprocessors soon enough and so they lost their
mainstay OEM business when those customers wanted to buy
their computer in a DIP instead of in a rack-mountable
box.  And that's something that one would have hoped
for DEC to have forseen; the whole company grew out
of modules as components, and shrinking system packaging.
Putting SSI DIPs on *small* single-height M-series Flip Chip
boards to emulate what they had done in R, S, etc. series
(e.g. you get a little board with a few NAND gates on it)
is wasting a level of packaging.  That's one of the
reasons the PDP-11 (CPU is a box of large boards;
most of the connections are runs on the boards)
wiped out the PDP-15 (CPU is a cabinet of small boards;
most of the connections are wires on the backplane).]
I think that Gordon Bell wanted to license the PDP-11
architecture to chip companies.  I don't know who opposed
it.  At one point he griped about "our vanity, protected
architectures."

Maybe the company should have broken itself up into
a handful of small companies in the late '70s,
but the ideal then was to be a large, vertically
integrated company like IBM, not a kairetsu/zaibatsu/?.

As someone once said, "Be careful who you choose as
your enemies, for you will become like them."
I (also) think that it was what happened to DEC, once
DEC started competing head-to-head on IBM's turf,
instead of DEC just offering great products
(modules; embeddable systems; time sharing)
that people wanted in a market DEC invented and
largely had to themselves.  IBM (like a gambler in
a casino) could afford to stay in the game until
the tables turned around enough (perhaps by
going through enough management changes until
they found a new CEO that did a good job.)
DEC couldn't.  They only had one chance at new
management, and the company didn't survive long
enough for them to get a CEO that could save
the company (as opposed to just saving 'shareholder
equity') since the new CEO sold us down the river.

As for DEC giving away manuals, I think that one attempt
to do TV ads was scuttled when KO said that it would be
cheaper to send the manual to every potential customer
in the country.  I think another was scuttled when he
was going to be in an ad in front of a DEC desktop,
and the Rainbow, DECmate, and Pro groups fought over
which one it would be (as if you could really tell :-).

As for The Computer Museum, I don't think the IRS did anything
to it.  It was DEC's private collection (started by KO & GB).
When Texas Instruments gave the Advanced Scientific Computer
to the museum, they wanted to also give some money to build the
display around it and conserve it.  Someone in TI's financial
department realized they were cutting a check to a competitor (DEC),
and TI decided they didn't want to do that.  So The Digital
Computer Museum, 501(c)3 was quickly formed, and DEC gave the
museum to it, and TI then gave the ASC and money to it too.
(They did business as The Computer Museum to make DEC's lawyers
happy, but the legal name was The Digital Computer Museum.
It's ambiguous.  I don't know if that was intentional.
In comparison, DEC once had an ad, "Isn't every computer a
Digital computer?" that I heard caused laywers to hit the roof.)

When DEC was going down the tubes and KO left and Bob Palmer's
anti-KO pogrom started, I think that support for the museum went
the way of Christmas Turkeys and the Mill and Digital Press.
Remember that around that time the economy of the whole area was
in the dumps.  A lot of other companies had supported the museum
also, but many of them were no longer able to (if they still existed
at all).  So for whatever reason, after Encore and Stellar/Ardent/Stardent,
Gordon went to work for Microsoft, and Gordon and Gwen took the museum
along.  (Now things are a lot better along Rt. 128, I think, but it's
too late -- the stuff is out there and they're creating a new museum
to take it over and the old computer museum in Boston is going to
connect somehow to the science museum in Boston.)  I do think it is a
real shame to have the collection out in the land of earthquakes
and mud slides and raging fires, where history in general
doesn't seem to count for much (since they don't have very
much history [as if anyplace in the US does, someone from
"The Old World" will say, no doubt] and everyone is so focussed
on the future), but there isn't much I can do about it,
and I guess my feelings are largely because I won't get to see it
much if at all where it is now.

The -14 was dead at that point, replaced by the -16 which doesn't really count
since it was basically a one-off custom product like its predecessor, the MPS
software was off-shelf for the most part, LINC was extinct. PDP-11 and VAX
were fairly identical softwarewise, as were the two 36-bitters.

The 12-bit line was mature and all the code written, and was dying on its own
because of the cheap WIntel products coming on line. The 18-bit was
dead-ending because of the decision to build the PDP-11/VAX line and go
IBM-style.

Bell looked at it this way - architecture and code are not the same thing.

The PDP-7 and PDP-15 were what modern designers would call RISC machines, no
microcode, just separate circuits for each instruction. The PDP-9 used B-212
flipchip cards for almost everything and a box of core ROM microcode. All ran
the same code (with some new instructions introduced in the -15)

Taken to the extreme, this was Bell's theory, you can build a little VAX and a
big VAX that run the same code but have completely different architectures.

BUT

The problem is that code should be optimized to the machine and the
combination optimized to the task - otherwise we're in the "modern" world of
code bloat and the need for gigs of disk space and megs of ram to do the same
job that megs of disk space and k's of core did.

My 1965 PDP-8 with 4K of core plays a mean game of chess, using the MIT crew's
bummed code utilizing all the resources of the machine to the fullest.

If its hardware were rebuilt out of modern high-speed parts using the same
architecture, it could probably run rings around WIntel-environment commercial
chess programs.

But the PDP-10 architecture provided incredible I/O bandwidth, the reason it
was the machine of choice for the proto-nets. And the instruction set provided
lots of ways of handling specialized big-bandwidth problems while keeping the
processor relatively load-free.

The PDP-8 was initially the Model T PC, then VolksComputer - everyone who
needed one could have just enough power to get the job done.

The 18-bit line filled in the middle, capable of running everything that
needed a midi.


These designs, at least the smaller word-length machines, were coming to the
end of their life cycles as hardware got cheaper. 
BUT DEC never developed replacements that would have meant a series of
optimized systems

 - My "now-serioudly-outdated" Pentium II -266 will need replacement mainly
because it will not run new commercial apps which do things I don't need or
want them to do, but won't do because the apps are all-or-nothing
general-purpose creations, and alternatives are not available to the current
version of me, who needs a turnkey system and simply does not have the time to
max-tweak a LINUX box.
 
| One academic paper on the PDP-11 design mentioned that
| the word length for the machine had been chosen for DEC
| by IBM to be a multiple of 8 bits -- IBM had convinced
| the customers that memory was sold in multiples of 8 bits.
| IBM switched from 36 to 32 and got many of the customers
| out there to go along with switching to the 360 architecture.
| Not all, but most.  There were even 360 architecture
| mutation [to fit the specialized job] avionics computers.

Variations of the stretch, more AEC than avionics

| And the semiconductor industry was going along with
| 8-bit-ism.  With today's technology, there wouldn't be a
| problem, the whole CPU is on one chip, so it can have
| as many bits in a word as you want.  But with
| semiconductors in the '70s-'80s making 4-bit and 8-bit
| RALUs and RAMs and ROMs and EPROMs, it wasn't easy to build
| 36-bit systems.  (I spent a lot of time with the KS10

Steam cars are inefficient - the optimized DEC systems were efficient for
getting to work, or hauling freight, racing,  or hauling a vacation's worth of
family and family stuff, etc. Same "basic" task, same "basic" system, but I
wouldn't want to run Indy in technology designed for a semi, or haul freight
with a suspension and stearing mechanism designed for racing.

Private conversation with Gwen Bell and museum staff concerning the move to
Museum Wharf. Content: The IRS said if you keep the museum at Marlborough, you
lose 501(c)3 n-f-p status.

|  It was DEC's private collection (started by KO & GB).

More than that - I got to *play* with one of GB's privately owned Enigmas,
which, according to several trusted historian/journalists (including James
Bamford and CBS News) were, at the time, still technically classified top
secret.

| When Texas Instruments gave the Advanced Scientific Computer
| to the museum, they wanted to also give some money to build the
| display around it and conserve it.  Someone in TI's financial
| department realized they were cutting a check to a competitor (DEC),
| and TI decided they didn't want to do that.  So The Digital
| Computer Museum, 501(c)3 was quickly formed, and DEC gave the
| museum to it, and TI then gave the ASC and money to it too.
| (They did business as The Computer Museum to make DEC's lawyers
| happy, but the legal name was The Digital Computer Museum.
| It's ambiguous.  I don't know if that was intentional.
| In comparison, DEC once had an ad, "Isn't every computer a
| Digital computer?" that I heard caused laywers to hit the roof.)

When the KA-10 went down that I used, it would print three bells and
then

%%DECSYSTEM-10 IS DOWN - WAIT PLEASE

Or something similar.  It was actually printed by the PDP-8/I (I
think) front end.  Sort of majestic in a room with 7 Model 35's and
2 model 33 ttys.

Actually, (having no experince with OS/8) I always thought that CP/M
resembles RT-11 version 2, and MS-DOS (a good part of which was
copied code from CP/M) resembled RT-11 version 3, with some TOPS-10
terminology mixed in.  For instance EXE files - in name only, not
concept - was what the executables were named in later TOPS-10 and
MS-DOS and SAV files (terminology) were used in early TOPS-10, RT-11
and CP/M flavors.

Not quite everyone yearned to have their initials in that SUBTTL line. Very 
few of the sources I mucked about in got a "/JE" appended. I figured it was 
just another way customers could find out who to pester about their favorite 
bugs/dreams.

When I had left DEC and came back as an ADP employee to port TOPS-10 to the 
KS10, I put my initials in every module I touched. I figured as an ADP 
employee I was safe from the entreaties of DEC customers, so I'd make up for 
all those years of hiding my identity. Unfortunately, when the KS10 line of 
development was SOUPed back into the mainstream development sources (perhaps 
by you, Barb?) the person who resolved the conflicts didn't chose to preserve 
my initials. Sigh! ;-)

Yes, if only the MCO files still existed. They're gone, aren't they? Sure 
would like to confirm if my memory of MCO #1595 is accurate.

There were two "sets" of MCOs on disk.  The internal set were
all the MCOs that were written.  The external set were the
MCOs that were shipped on the Monitor tape for the perusal
of the customers.  I would suspect that the "support KS10"
would be one of those that we marked for customer reading.
You would have to find the tape that contains the major 
monitor release after that MCO (I don't remember which one
it would be--either 6.03A or 7.01).  I hadn't really started 
putting my nose into packaging until later.

And, yes, I suspect that those MCO files are gone.  I saw
no evidence of BLKC or BLKB when I said goodbye to the DEC's
last KL.

'ey, Larry :-).  Yup, it is automatic.  I always initialed my
work when I worked in Tape Prep (that was before your time :-))
and just never stopped.  Initials were probably reinforced
because we called each other by those "names" occasionally.  I
always said "tee-double-ya" when talking to Tony.

We (the RT-11 development group) had some T-shirts made up years
ago which alluded to this philosphy...

	"Who says you can't love something small
	 that finishes fast?"

And yes, having used TOPS-10 first, using RT-11 was familiar...

Some of the RT sources had that same sort of convention, though
in comments, not on the .TITLE or .SBTTL lines...

One of our team took it upon himself to document, in the subsystem
he worked on -- SL (single-line editor) -- the initials of all the
team members for any given release, starting, I think, with V4.0.

I maintain a list of all the people that I know about who ever
worked on RT-11 (managers and writers included), along with the
initials that developers used when touching the sources...

These aren't very stupid questions.  Documenting them was
one of the difficult things we had to do every monitor release.

<snip questions & answers>

The documentation that described the steps was called the
Monitor Installation Guide.  To check out the accuracy of
the documentation, a person (whom we called the Token Dummy)
took a set of installation tapes, the documentation, and
usually the writer of the documentation, and followed the
instructions.  I was the first Token Dummy.  We made a big
deal of the Official Token Dummy; one of the benefits of
being one was to get invited to the "Thank the Gods They
Finally Let Us Ship the Damn Thing" party.

My memory of that t-shirt was that it said "%DECSYSTEM-20
NOT RUNNING".  The -10 monitor group wanted a similar
t-shirt and I fought long and hard to have the words
DECSYSTEM-10 CONTINUED put after the "not running"
phrase.  I wanted to advertise the fact that crashes
and dumps no longer interrupted timesharing.  I finally
won.

<snip>

TOPS10 shipped sources as an integral part; TOPS20 had a source
tape that could be bought for a very high price (there were 
advantages to this but I won't go into them here).  The problem
with splitting the sources and binaries up into two products
was that the sources never built what was shipped on the binary
tapes.  There was always a schism.  Another problem is that
shipping both together made internal source management 
honest.  It just wasn't possible to slip something in the
binaries without having it go through the procedures to
get it into the sources.  That way nothing got lost.

An important note to make is that some of these were

different from a system designed for general use.

It was a one-size fits all software mentality that was
contrary to our business experience.  Insisting that
customers conform to one was stupid since our customers
didn't want that (that's why they bought DEC equipment
rather than IBM in the old days--they liked to make
their own decisions).

IMO, the problem with Bell's influence is that he had
no concept of the importance of software in DEC's business.
It was he who got rid of the upper management who knew
software.

And here you're mixing up hardware and software.  Note that
you catagorize the -11s as a hardware group but separate 
the 36-bit hardware into two (which was software).

Mine does indeed say CONTINUED, but it is possible more than one t-shirt
was produced. I think mine comes from the time when users were
pressuring DEC to continue making 36 bit systems going. The computer
line was (hopefully) continued, not just one machine. Given the
COMD% JSYS, command line interpreters would be useful to
a lot more people.

At Columbia University, we decided to switch to UNIX when the DEC-20 was
discontinued.  In migrating, we wanted to port a bunch of our favorite
programs to UNIX, notably MM, and so developed a COMND JSYS library for C
(and an MM program too).  You can find them both at the Columbia
ftp site:

  ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/ccmd/  <-- COMND JSYS for C
  ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/mm/    <-- MM in C

Also, C-Kermit has a COMND-like user interface:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckermit.html

but it uses its own command package rather than ccmd, which adds a few
things that COMND lacked (variables, file lists on ?, etc) and lacks
a few COMND features (e.g. noise words).

Btw, REV (more or less) lives again as a Kermit script:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckscripts.html

MM and CCMD development stopped long ago (MM has some Year-2000 issues,
which is a shame 'cause I still use it, and might have to fix it myself
if nobody else does), but the Kermit Project is still going.

As I've posted here before, Bob Clements had absolutely nothing to do with 
the implementation of the RCC stopcd. It was purely a creation of Don Lewine 
as a "tribute" to Bob, who had recently left the monitor group to return to 
hardware engineering. The name Range Check Chunk was decided upon at a 
Monday Monitor Group meeting at which I was a participant. It was put into 
SCNSER because Bob had been responsible for that module during his tenure in 
the group.

System A, a stunning number of ME10s, and the ex-FDC TU30s were in one room.
The big room held the rest of A (SA10A, a couple of 10-8 channels), all of
the comm junk, and all of System B. For some reason the floor was pretty
new, and when I got there the big room was so empty in there that the
operators used to have races on roller skates and indoor hockey.

Wow, it must be a whole different beast than the one on the SA10A.  It would
have been really cool to have lights somewhere... but since the things
pretty much never broke, you didn't really need them.  Besides,
since the SA10A was so wierd and almost a prototype, I don't think its front
panel was much more than a prototype debugging tool.

That was a cool system, with the FDC TU30s showing flame marks on them, and
two big lines of ME10s facing each other.  Late at night, if I was bored or
waiting for a build or something, you could play "repeat examine next".
Since it was a dual-KA (DECsystem-1055) with 256K (a full 18 bits of
memory), you could go to the OPSER terminal, :SET RUN NO CPU1, walk over to
the slave, press HALT, examine some random location, then select REPEAT and
EXAMINE NEXT.  When the address would get to 777777 it would wrap to zero
and you would just go around and around. The ME10s would flash away,
depending on how they were interleaved. It was fun to watch.  When you are
done, just start the slave at 407 (or was it 403?), then walk over to OPSER
and :SET RUN CPU1

Hey MRO guys! Remember when the tri-SMP 10 in Marlboro (1026/1042/1322) was
running backups, the light show was just awesome? KL1026 was the TOPS-10
development system and it had about one oddball device of everything on it,
whole bunches of all kinds of disks, including a big box of Ampex memory and
two strings of TU70/72/73s.

OBTW, as far as I know 1042 was the last real 10 that ran as KL1026, in NIO.
Even though it was a KL10D (with the big tall cabs), it had 4 meg of
internal KL10E memory and a NIA20 wedged into it. Nice, tidy little package.
At the end, it had something like 4 RP06s on it. It also booted up as gidney
for the random -20 stuff.  Fitting that system would be the last one in
"Engineering". (I know, cause I shut the lights off over there.)

Oh yes Ben worked on that thing, he will remember it. Ben spent many long
nights at Defies Logic keeping that senior hardware running.

One day I came in and System B was down. Ben had diagnosed the problem as a
bad chip on the SA10. Components just plugged in to a wirewrap kinda
backplane, so it ought to be a 10 second job to plug in another chip. The
chip was something like a 16 input NAND gate. Ben looked all around trying
to find this part, which should be common enough. Unfortunately SC had the
world's supply of whatever this rare chip was.  At this time Defies Logic
wasn't paying any SC bills (not paying bills was a way of life there), and
SC wouldn't give us the chip till we had paid for a couple SA10s, the latest
Fred Wright code, and some other stuff.  Meanwhile the main revenue
producing system was DOWN. Finally, Ron wired SC the cash, SC set us a 32
cent chip, and we were back on the air.

That place was nuts, but it was also a lot of fun.

We had to have all those oddball devices because we supported
them.  If we supported a piece of hardware, it was a requirement
that we be able to test the software and use them for debugging.
As a matter of fact, we had to keep a 7-track tape drive on
the end of one of those TU70 strings because there was still
a customer who ordered 7-track tapes.  (It would have been
cheaper just to give them a 9-track but managers didn't seem
to know how to count back then.)  And I don't remember having
AMPEX memory.  That was also because of support reasons.  JMF
would have loved to have had AMPEX memory but Digital, in its
infinite wisdom (read that idiocy) insisted that we develop
based on its old technology.  Our 5-CPU customer site did
use AMPEX so that hardware checkout was covered when we did
the software development.  If it weren't for our customers'
cooperation, Digital would have been out of business in 1981.

Absolutely. AFAIR, the only source bits of the monitor that shipped were
the bits that defined static tables (such as job and process tables),
to allow you to build a new monitor tuned to your environment. However,
the FORTRAN compiler shipped with full source (in BLISS-10) and
copies of the EXEC source were widely available in an unofficial
way, which led to the availability of lots of user-written EXEC
extensions. (It also allowed us to build an April Fools Day version
of the EXEC, but that's another story...)

TOPS-10 was developed by digital;   Tops-20 was BBN TenNex and required the
"BBN PAGE BOX".  Tops-10 had evolved from the KA10 through the KI10 as a
Real Memory (Swap) not a virtual memory (18 bit Address ...). Tops-20 was a
pure virtual memory system.
Around here we realized that the structure on memory access was LOTS more
important than the instruction set (something that Gordon Bell never
realized) {Pls recall that digital had LARGE manufacturing plants at that
time}.

We had always a battle internally for the specification of HOW MUCH memory
would be required.The VAX was originally going to be a variant of the KL10
(as was the ill fated PDP-15KL). On ML5-5 we had a KL-10 (Actually I believe
a KS 10) running TenNex with 32Kw that was a prototype for the follow-up for
the 11/45. The intrent was for RSTS and TOPS to merge into a single
offering.

But we did support non-DEC hardware.  One of our biggest selling
points (this was before your time, Megan) was that we could talk
to other manufacturers' hardware.  So customers could have a 
mixed bag of hardware satisfying all their various flavors of
users (especially those IBMers).

What we  (TOPS10) were not prepared to do (and that was done 
by a group known as Computer Special Systems) was schedule our 
developer time to implement that hardware.  That's why so many of our
customers had clever monitor people.  A side effect of "allowing"
our customers to do their own development was that we ended up
with very educated customers.  IMO, that was a plus.  

Another one of our mistakes is that we stopped listening to those
customers.

This was a maintenance issue that, I believe, was handled badly.
The process that was imposed on us that determined the flavors
of maintenance and our answers to that maintenance was just
a bullshit load of bureuocracy (how do you spell that word?).
The system of rules that we had to follow were never based on
common sense, IME.

Well I can't take complete credit for making the system unloginable. A lot
of people had their hands on Gidney towards the end. I never visited 1026
(actually 1042) and Gidney after they were exiled to NIO, but I know I
logged in to GSCOTT there. So it probably wasn't me.

On the other hand, if you tried to login to OPERATOR or F-S remotely, you
couldn't have done that for years.

In the glory days, would try to hack Gidney (aka tops20.dec.com) all of the
time. (This was when there was only a handful of systems in DEC that had
access to the internet and there was lots of Corporate Paperwork and
Procedures to go through to justify our connection, which we had from the
days of 2102 and DEC-MARLBORO.)

Jeanne Dusseault had a bunch of programs that would run around and check the
status of EVERY directory on the CFS cluster every night. I think it used to
email her a report as well. We ended up writing some cool spy-on-the-hacker
tools (easy to do, it was kinda like PHOTO but from another terminal), and I
beefed up the ACJ to watch for Unusual Things.

Maybe some well meaning person tightened the security a bit too much at some

because it was only accessible inside DEC and it wasn't running VMS.

TOPS10's version number went from 5.nn to 6.nn (6.01) with the 
advent of VMSER.MAC which was an unbundled product until
we smushed everything together, simplifying packaging,
licensing, etc.  DEC had managed to unbundle just about 
everything but the kitchen sink by then.  I know that 7.01
was another excuse to get everything back onto one tape.
The VM part of the filename stood for
virtual memory.  That should give you guys a hint about
when things happened.  

I seem to recall that the inhouse attitude w.r.t. PFH
was it eventually was a crock (but I can't remember
why that came about).  But it was developed
on ML5-5 by Peter. So that means that it had to be a
KA to KI or a KI to KA compatibility code.

I just can't seem to remember when I was allowed to 
move PFH.MAC to the Customer Supported Tape (or its
equivalent in those days).  I do know that I argued
long and hard with Magee about where it should go;
it was one of those issues that I had to resort to
going to Jim and have him tell Magee what should be
done.  ...grumble...mumble...My biggest sexual 
discrimination problems were from other women...not men.

603A was the last TOPS-10 Monitor that ran on the KA.
To run an EXE file, the entire file had to be read into physical memory.
If memory was tight, the core image would immediately be paged out to
the swapping disk.  Then individual pages could be paged back in on demand
from swap space.

Anyone remember when PFH.EXE disappeared?

Branching out a little, when the KA101 was replaced, I remember that
when we went to a KL, I was working on some crystallographic
programs.  I think the limits were (in general) 30k real and 60k
virtual.  Which meant that a 40k (initial) job might not work if it
needed the to be read in all the time.

What I did (after reading the instructions as to what VM did) was to
write a short segment of code which when the program started
running, I would page out every other page in the lowseg.  This got
the page fault handler running (you needed a page fault to get it
started).  So I might allocate 60meg to a job, it would settle down
eventually to about 40-45k - just the matrix, the least squares calc
and the Fortran.  These things ran in batch for several hours.  And
these jobs would accumulate run time much more quickly than the jobs
the computer center were running at higher priority - they ran in
all physical, and as far as I could tell, would get swapped out much
more often.

<snip>

A similar thing happened when Jim and Dan were doing the KL
code (you didn't know that the KL almost became toast, did you?).
Jim and Dan did their development on the same stand alone pack using
one of the breadboards KLs in hardware engineering.  It was 
usually the habit to "forget" to spin down and remove their
pack...probably because JMF did his work during the 3:00-12:00
shift and Dan would pick up when Jim left off.  

One day, a Person from diagnositics had the system stand alone
to test his "zero the pack" diagnostic.  He saw a pack on the
disk and decided to use it for his test.  His diagnostic worked
so well, he wiped out all of Software Engineering's KL work.
At the time, everybody believed that it was gone since nobody
had put the pack on a regular backup schedule.  Then Jim came
in and was told about the disaster.  One week before the 
Person did his best to scuttle the project, Jim was carrying
the pack through our machine room and saw Dave, the operator.
Just on an impulse he handed the pack to Dave and asked for
a backup to be done if Dave had a spare moment.  Jim being 
Jim did not write out a work request (in those days, 
operators weren't allowed to do "extra" work without a 
work request), so Jim didn't think that Dave got around to
doing the backup.  Everybody had to wait until Dave came in
because there wasn't a record of the backup.  Dave came
in and discovered that he was the most popular guy in the
world that day.  He had done the backup because it was
Jim who had asked him and Software Engineering only lost
one week's worth of work.

I don't see where the violation occurred.  They bought hardware,
got the software and continued to pay maintenance.  What they
actually ran was their business....as long as they didn't 
insist that _we_ fix their problems.  Lots of cash came in,
and we didn't have to spend any money to maintain them.

Another criteria was the size of the customer.  ORNL tended to get
a lot of attention.  Jim's first job at DEC involved living in
a hotel room down there for a long time (in his opinion).  From
his stories about that time, the PDP-12 stuff was murder.

One of the things that Software Engineering did to clean up messes
like that was remastering the CUSP tape to just one physical magtape.
IIRC, there were 21 "updates" which also involved several flavors
of SCAN and WILD.

As the -10 groups did business over the years, we figured out how
to do all that with various source management systems and testing
procedures.  I don't think those would work with a distribution
such as Msoft has.  The SPR aspect of it would just bury us.  All
that backlog of unanswered SPRs was one of the "facts" that was 
used to end the -10 business.  It was "proof" that our code and
systems were not maintainable.

I'm very interested in how this open source business is working...
or not.  Watching how it works is on my list of "things to do
someday".

Alan, how in the world do you think DEC was profitable?  The PDP-10
product line just didn't get the "credit" because of the way the
books worked.  Software Engineering was a _credit_ center...not
a profit center.  In other words, it "lost" money by design.
JMF always wanted the -10 world to get really separated from the
rest of DEC.  That way, if we sunk, it was because we did it...not
those small computer thinkers doing it to us.

You weren't around for that plotter (which never worked).  Well, we

when you were :-).

Yup.  I think it was TU71; I was going to say it but I'm so bad

Yup.  I even got to visit those sites.  They had other sites, but
not five KLs' worth.  Dwayne gave Jim a configuration map of the
5-CPU site.  Jim had it on his office wall.  One day, in the
process of moving, he removed them and put them on his desk in
his new office.  The next day, he came in and they were gone.
He came home just absolutely shattered.  Later in the week,
his co-horts presented him with the config nicely framed.
There were two other posters that had also disappeared to
get framed.  He was touched (and very glad that somebody
hadn't stolen his pictures).

Yea, we had arguments about whether there should be commissions
or not.  The year that they combined the mini sales force with
the mainframe sales force got good results.  One mini sales'
type was so pleased that he could fill his yearly sales quota 
with one PDP-10 sale.  When I heard about that, I had not 
realized that sales departement had become so bad.  Our
theory was that that organization really was a subsidiary
of IBM.

One of the things that gets lost in the "wouldn't it be neat to have a
PDP-10 emulator" mantra is that many of the things that made
programming and using the -10 still wouldn't be conveniently available
outside of the -10 environment.

One of the most wonderful aspects of MACRO-10 was its macro language.  It
had loops, string variables, you could process items one character at
a time (IRPC).  All these are alien concepts to C programmers, and the
typical Unix assembler is simply woeful.

With MACRO-10, TOPS-10 could build the database for its file systems
at OS build time, the Lexical analysis piece of TULIP I/O Package let
you write lexical analysis "instructions" that were far more readable
than the pseudo-code a macro generated.  Once, as a hack, I wrote something
where I could give a macro a list of keywords and the macro generated a
tree-structured parse table for the names.

I looked a m4 once, wow - about 20 years ago, and wrote it off as
uninteresting.

Microsoft's Z80 assembler had many of the same features (back in those
days Microsoft had a PDP-10).

.SOAPBOX
We're missing the boat here w.r.t many of the things that made the -10
special.  The last month has been very busy, but I hope to prepare some
WWW pages, each highlighting one of my favorite aspects of the -10. I
spent part of an evening in a hotel room typing a TULIP page off the
top of my head.  It's surprising how few things I'll have to check the
source code to get right!

I've thought of writing the macro processing part of MACRO-10 in C, but I
think that will have to wait for retirement!

It's been a long time since I took up any of this, but I think you've hit
on it exactly.  MACRO-20 was in many ways the easiest of the many languages
I used; when I moved to VMS, one of my projects was adding some new
functionality to a brain-damaged DCL script.  Since the script I was working
from was so bad, I decided to rewrite it structured as a MACRO-20 program.
Skip returns from subroutines and everything.  I was told, years later, that
the new structure made adding the next new feature a snap (which was my
point exactly).  AFAIK it's still in use at a major New York bank.

Originally from Bill Wulf's group at CMU.  The book "Design of an Optimizing

(at least one of which [Steve Hobbs] ended up at DEC) describes it's
development IIRC.

It was on catagory four support from Digital. What this meant was that

MODULE

If my memory serves me right Bliss was developed at CMU and there were
connections between Gordon Bell/CMU/Digital.  

Few things on the 10 were actually written in a high level language, most
stuff was written in Macro-10.  I think the Fortran-77 (the time tested
language of wisdom) compiler was written in Bliss-10.

There was a Bliss-36, a Bliss-16, and a Bliss-32.  Lots of VMS stuff was
written in Bliss-32.  Bliss-11 may have been Decus, but a source license
for Bliss-32 was probably a lot harder to get :-).  Bliss-10 came with
source code in the tradition of 10-ness and was not Decus.

I think Bliss was part of the Gordon Bell strategy to have one single 
basket for everybody.  Instead of having multiple platforms with their
own assembly language development teams they could all convert to Bliss
and everything would be cheaper.  Obviously there was great resistance
internally and from the customer bases using the platforms that were....
huff....going to "disappear".

Later we'd heard that Gordon was working for Bill Gates as an "advisor".
I wonder how much of Windows/NT is written in Bliss?.  I wonder if there
is a Visual Bliss compiler in the dungeons of Redmond? :-)

ELUDOM :-)

Before there was Fortran-77, there was Fortran-10 (or F10), and that
compiler (I think) used Bliss, as opposed to Fortran-40 (F40) which
did not.

Yup.  Fortran-10 v. 7 was the first Fortran 77 version of Fortran-10; versions
10 and 11 were improvements thereto.  There was, of course, no Fortran 90...

>>There was a Bliss-36, a Bliss-16, and a Bliss-32.  Lots of VMS stuff was

They certainly were.  Bliss-36 cost *lots* of money when it came out as a
product; BLISS-10 was sent out for free with Fortran (and the Tops-20 EXEC,
because there were some extensions written--at CMU, naturally--in BLISS-10).

A couple or four years ago, Digital announced that Bliss-32 was being made
freely available, source and all, to the VMS universe.  Since the Bliss-36
sources were the same (different compilation switches), I convinced the folks
handling licensing for XKL that Bliss-36 should be treated the same way for
PDP-10 customers...

There were, of course, various flavors of DECnet. The "native" -10 stuff
(ANF-10) was originally written in pure assembler, but then, as I recall,
rewritten in part in BLISS-10 in the era of the "BLISS is Ignorance" button
days (I still have mine). The VAX/-11 style DECnet was written in part in
BLISS, in a vain hope that it would have been a simple port. It wasn't.

I don't recall this -10 side VAX style DECnet ever being released to
customers, though. Instead, the DN8x front ends mediated between ANF-10
style DECnet and VAX/-11 style DECnet, turning it all into ANF-10 style on
the -10 side. I don't recall that the -10 side code was BLISSed, although I
could well be wrong. I know some of this code was being written in BLISS,
but again, I don't recall it being released that way. Maybe after I left in
1976 this was changed.

I wrote a fair amount of BLISS code, and liked it pretty well. One thing
that kept it from being well received in -10 land was that PDP6/10/20
machine language with appropriate macros was so easy to write. And debugging
was simplicity -- at that time high level debuggers were flawed at best, and
there was no BLISS debugger. So you had to figure out what code the BLISS
compiler would generate, and how it related to the source, then try to trace
it through. Because BLISS was largely stack oriented, that meant taking lots
of time searching up and down the stack for pointers to values. It was
easier just to implement the program in assembler. In fact, much of the
BLISS code that I wrote started out as assembler, and then was hand-coded in
BLISS to try and get the compiler to generate something like what the
assembler did. If -10 machine language had been as awful as, say, 360
assembler, then BLISS would have been a great success throughout LCG.

There is a relevant note from Bill Gosper in HACKMEM, to this effect: The
myth that a language can be machine independant is easily exploded by
considering the simple problem of adding one repeatedly to a variable,
trapping and dismissing any interrupts caused. If the number becomes
negative zero, then it's a two's complement machine. If it becomes negative
one, then it's a one's complement machine. If the machine halts with an
overflow, then it's a machine designed by somebody with a read only mind.

This applies when trying to write operating system code for networking in
higher level languages. The VAX and the -10 were sufficiently different that
deciding which portions had to be assembler coded and then trying to debug
took longer than just assembly coding the whole thing. So that's why it was
assembly language coded and then translated into BLISS, checking that the
compiler didn't screw up too badly and lose the desirable side-effects.
Things are somewhat different now, particularly with sophisticated debuggers
and tools like lint, and now about the only excuse for writing in assembler
is that you need precise control over the timing of events or the sequence
of instruction execution.

I think that the primary lesson to be learned from BLISS-xx is that a good
compiler isn't enough -- you must have debuggers and other support tools.
These were not really available.

Very close, just stick "The" in front.  ISBN 0-444-00158-1 (paper) or
0-444-00164-6 (hard) from Elsevier.  This describes BLISS-11 (DECUS
10-213) which came after BLISS-10 and before BLISS-36 and its Common
BLISS siblings.  In addition to better optimization, BLISS-11 improved
the macro facility compared to BLISS-10.  Common BLISS was even better
in these areas.

Even BLISS-10 did some very clever things when you looked at the
generated code.  Since the macro facility was builtin and had some
knowledge of the language elements it was more useful than C's
preprocessor.  Of course, sometimes it was too clever sometimes, like
when I wrote a structure definition which generated a subroutine call
for each reference.  I changed that fast.

As far as source for BLISS-10, I think it was included by DEC.  Of course,
since we used a version straight from CMU which did have source, I wasn't
paying attention to say nothing of it being 25 years ago.  Came in handy
when we had to fix a bug in the compiler.

FYI, when I got my copy (June '97) it was apparently available only from Books
on Demand.  I felt a little stupid paying $49.90 for a blurry paper-bound
photocopy with some of the pages crooked, but at least it beats being 100%
out of print.  I think I remember something about the old ISBN being NFG now,
but they were able to look it up from the title.  If anyone cares, this was
UMI in Ann Arbor MI, (313) 761-4700.

BLISS was not "not looked upon favorably by Digital".  To the
contrary, BLISS was THE strategic system implementation language at
Digital for many years, as other replies have noted.  Compilers,
operating systems, network software, database systems, you-name-it,
was implemented in BLISS.  I wrote many thousands of lines of BLISS.

BLISS was never looked upon very favorably in 36-bit-land for a couple
of reasons.  One is that MACRO was the "true language" of 36-bit
implementation;  anything done in BLISS was looked at askance by most
36-bitters.  Another reason is that BLISS was really best targeted to
architectures with byte-addressability.  As soon as you needed to keep
36-bit byte-pointers in BLISS, with the funny "@" dereferencing
syntax, things got ugly fast.  BLISS was, I think, originally
developed for the -10, but ironically enough it just never worked very
well there compared to the -11 and the VAX.

Gordon Bell was the Father of the BLISS Strategy at Digital.  Although
he is at Microsoft now, it's a safe bet that there isn't any BLISS in
Windows, especially Windows NT.  Dave Cutler was the Father of Windows
NT, and he hated BLISS with a passion at Digital;  he once demanded
that the DEC VP of Software (Heffner) fire the whole BLISS group, just
because they were the BLISS group and this was by definition a useless
waste of corporate resources;  I have a copy of this memo.

There is much more, but it is not well to dwell too much on the
past.........

For a good reason.  Anything written in BLISS was pretty much
unmaintainable by the vast majority of 36-bitters.  Most DEC software
written in BLISS was in BLISS-36, not BLISS-10, meaning that most people
didn't have the compiler.  CMU's PCL extensions for EXEC (which never
worked particularly reliably) were a good example; eventually some nice
person ran BLISS with the "list generated assembly code" option on those
files so we could have proper .MAC files to edit.

As I recall, the code generated by the BLISS compiler was horrible.  Most
C compilers on x86, Alpha, etc. can generate better code than a human can
write assembly by hand.  The situation was the exact opposite on the
PDP-10.

<snip>

Yup.  Even DEC's PDP-10 people didn't have it.  I had to have one
our developers do incredible cludges just to get the warnings
out of the compiles for packaging purposes.  Any problems with
BLISS-36 that we considered bugs were declared "features" and
not a problem by the idiots up north.  It was a royal PITA and
caused me to heap even further hexes on G. Bell.

When I was at C-MU, I rewrote some of my BLISS code in MACRO-10.
Between Macro and Tulip, I produced a better results.  Implementation
time was probably greater, but heck, if I wanted something quick, I'd
use SAIL, and Algol-like language from Stanford.

I guess I don't remember the code quality.  I do recall keeping tabs
on the object file size - it jumped up if I forgot a "." in front of a
variable.  One problem - BLISS wanted to pass arguments on the stack.
Assembler programmers use registers and on the -10 use certain
registers for pointers to things that needed to be passed to many
routines within a module, so the argument passing cost for them was
zero.

Last summer I rewrote Tru64 Unix's IP checksum routine (it's all assembler).
When I was done, I translated the assembler into C and tried that.  For
the first time in 30 years, a compiler beat my assembler code.  Somewhat
mortified, I looked at the generated code and found the C compiler was
keep different intermediate data that allowed it more latitude scheduling
instructions.  Rewrote my code to do that and finally came up with faster
code thanks to earlier memory fetches than the C compiler thought was safe.

I don't know if my code would have been faster if I started from scratch,
but boy, I sure can't recommend writing Alpha assembler unless you have
good evidence the C code is slow.

JMF would recommend assembler.  He had a hell of a time trying
to program around C bugs that couldn't [actually wouldn't] be
fixed in his implementation time frame.  One of the unsung
advantages of developing base software with assembler, and _not_
with a compiler currently under development, is that one ends
up working with an unchanging base.  It's hard enough to 
schedule OS developement without having to depend on a 
language development schedule.

Particularly if you're using a DEC C compiler!!

I've encountered many C compilers which do bizarre things.  I got into the
habit of aggressive prototyping as a result of compilers which will
misframe arguments without precise type-matching.  Nevertheless, even if
bizarre it was still valid compiler behavior.

The only C compilers that I've caught generating bad (as in provably
wrong) code are from DEC, and on multiple occasions.  Some were merely
annoying, such as not allowing addition to the return value from strchr().
But then there were the subtle ones, such the intermittant wrong values of
post-incremented shorts -- it would only do the wrong thing with certain
initial values, not with others.

GreenHills (Also sold as Oasys and MicroTec) would occasionally
push a short instead of an int, generally when the parameter was
an expression containing only shorts and constant zeros. We had
some _strange_ #defines to avoid the near-occasion of that one.
Later versions had some dubious notions about const parameters.
Alcyon C (for CP/M 68K and Atari TOS) was "almost, but not quite,
completely unlike C" in its treatment of pointers and arrays.
Whatever C compiler 3DO provided for the ARM would regularly
muff expressions involving arrays of short...

	Of course, Vax-11C was an un-remitting nightmare, but
most of the goblins were in the run-time library (which appeared
to be a "shim" between RMS and stdio, written by someone who
understood neither), rather than the compiler proper. Not that
crappy run-time libraries are all that rare. I always wonder why
I should trust an "all singing, all-dancing multi-lingual message
class" from the same bozos who can muff strtoul() and memcmp() :-)

Another reason that BLISS was not looked upon favorably by PDP-10ers
is that an edict came down that declared all subsequent developement
and _patches_ to the TOPS10 monitor (I don't know about TOPS20) had
to be done with BLISS.  First of all, one didn't tell the TOPS10
developers how to program; second of all, I still have no idea
how one applies a bliss patch to an EXE with DDT....but that's 
what the suits' specification outlined.  The term "a horse
designed by jackasses producing a camel" comes to mind.

Well, Jim had another disadvantage.  He was known as one
of _those_ TOPS10 guys.  He never did figure out how to
get through the snobbery of VAX/VMS folklore.

He did explain the bug and workaround to me, but I was pretty
sick then and don't remember the details at all.  I'm not
even sure exactly what Alpha work he did.  All I have is
a plaque that had been presented to him for his contribution.

I did something like this in 1972 on the KA-10 at Stevens. We built a device
called an MK-10. The design was done by Allen Kent, I think. Bob Clements
wrote the Music Player and I am not sure who wrote the compiler. We wrote
dozens of songs. The player just twiddled the low order few bits of AC0 and
the MK10 was connected to the LED drivers on the console. We could program 4
or 6 voices (one for each bit). The device had a pot for each voice so that
we could adjust them independently. We fed it into a stereo.

I remember reading about the MK10.  Back around 1984 or so, a couple
of friends and I also got some of the old music files (I think I still
have them) and a music player...

At the time, I had a pdp-11/10.  The TI Sound Generation Controller
had just come out, and I built a simple circuit to allow the -11/10
to drive it using a DR11C parallel interface.  I tubbed it the MK11-A
as a tip-o-the-hat to the MK10...

A friend of mine saw what I had done and developed something with a
little more guts (as well as probably being more correct as a design
than mine) which allowed control of three SGCs... A couple of us
built them to this design (which we dubbed the MK11-B) and another
friend wrote a series of programs for RT-11 -- one which compiled the
old music files, one which built patch libraries (for MIDI devices)
and a player.

Having some experience in reading music, I entered a number of other
songs which I then shared... One was Scott Joplin's 'Crush Collision Rag'.

I'm pretty sure I could find at least the old song files.  I think I
may still have some documentation for the song compiler input format.

Ah, yes.  I'd forgotten about that; I was still sorta owned by
Maynard then and didn't get to watch the creation of the Galaxy.

I remember when Tony would come in at 3AM.  He used to really piss
me off because he would kick everybody off _all_ the machines.
I would come back an hour later to see what he was doing on the
machine I was using, and it would be just dead. grrrrr...
He was a person whose bite was worse than his bark until he
got his coffee infusion. :-)

"Music Kludge-10".  A friend dumped all available music to an audio cassette
shortly before KA-101 went away.  I don't know what's become of the tape.

I still have the reel tape we made that night.

For those that don't realize, the MK-10 only really worked well when the
program could basically have the whole CPU, so it was not something to run
during normal timesharing service.

Having ported Ingres (the version that came with BSD 4.1 [?], not the
commercial version) to TOPS-10, the one thing that really bit me was that
there was no good choice for representing (char *) on the 10.  The compiler
I was using stored them as a byte count from 0, which made pointer arithmetic
easy but made dereferencing a pointer, or casting it to a non char pointer,
expensive.  Storing them as byte pointers would have done the opposite.

Of course this was aggravated by the tendency of the original Ingres crew to
declare _all_ pointers as char *.

We actually did two.

First, we wrote a DBMS package.
Specifically because System 1022 had a hard stop limit of 18-bits of
records per database. We needed more than that, and we ended up
writing our own. Ended up with 700,000 records filling an RP07.
Wow, that was huge back then.

The second was a client/server application that used DEC-Pro350
(PDP-11) "personal computers" as intellegent programmable terminals
for our KLs. We also had a version that used a Vaxen or multi-user
PDP-11 as an intellegent concentrator for Vt100s. This was 
before "decnet phase 3" made interoperability and/or 
internetworking between DEC product lines feasible :-)

Gee, That was along time ago, so the specifics are fuzzy.
We were a Tops-20 source site, running the "current" monitors.
We jumped on whatever Tops-20 first had user mode extended
addressing. The hardware were six KL, all of which
ended up as B models, usually 2060s or 2065s.

The code was used as tools for applications, most of which
were written in Cobol with System 1022 as the datastore.

I'm not sure what else you're currious about. Let me know,
and if I remember...

Funny, We didn't see this problem. Of course, we weren't building
a monitor. But we constantly used the usual edit/compile/debug cycle,
and it was effective for Bliss-36. 

For the crossported stuff, where we had to run Bliss-16 on the KL,
the download and TKB crud from PDP-11 land added tons of time
to the cycle. But I think the inept PDP-11 debugging tools cost
as much as the compilers themselves.

I'm not claiming Bliss-36 was as fast as Macro-20, but it was not
a problem for us.

We didn't run our KLs are grossly overloaded as education sites.
We had users paying for the machines, and they complained about
performance when we had 50 or so users simultaneously.

Thanks.  Jim was always chuckling about the bronzed tennis
shoes that [now I can't remember the guy's name] had in his
office.  I think he was a product manager around the time
you showed up smelling of smoke and looking very, very, very

The 1978 contract for one KL that replaced a KA stipulated that a bunch of the
KA's peripherals would be supported for 5 years.

Then 7-track desupport was announced at DECUS.

Then DEC was reminded of the site's 7-track.

I suspect that something like a modern 9-track was supplied in exchange.

Chuckle.  I remember Jim and Tony doing quite a bit of
head scratching trying to imagine a customer situation
where those were still useful.  Once they got over the hump
of eliminating those (I suspect TW remembered needing them),
the rest was pretty easy.

No, that old 7-track TU10 (IIRC) was supported for 5 years.  After all, it
would have been quite hard to read the old 7-track tapes people had laying
around on a 9-track drive.  Someone even dug up a few cans of KL blue spray
paint to make the door on the controller rack match the new equipment.

I wish we'd desupported non-random-access .REL input to LINK to get
relocatable psects.  Setting psect origins by hand because we couldn't read
the .REL twice was ridiculous.  I think desupporting overlays would have made
LINK a lot simpler, too.

But customers (ie ADP) continued to charge running programs by memory size
long after it stopped making any sense, so people _used_ overlays all over the
place. Killing actual performance, of course.

Chuckle.  I don't know anybody who wouldn't have dumped a
TU10 and TU20 for TU7x.  As much as I hated magtape, TU7x
were the best in the business.

If there is anybody nostalgic for TU10s, I'd really like
to know about them so I can study them as a very strange 
animal :-).

DCE?  What's that?  Patches to Fortran-10 are not patches to
Bliss.

I don't remember Magee ever making a Bliss source tape or a 
build of Bliss.  If it got to customers, it wasn't through
the usual channels.

That's because it was impossible to do a field test and distribution.
Another indicator that the sources were not available.  TW didn't
make that monitor edit so that Bliss could still do illegal things
for nothing.

Ah, Bliss-10.  In late '75 I inherited MCS-10 (Message Control System
- DEC's answer to transaction processing at the time).  The majority
of the messaging logic was written in Bliss-10, about a 4 inch thick
listing on old 132 column fan fold printer paper.

After I finally got it to work (and ship!), with JMF's help of course,
a new version of Bliss-10 came out and when I compiled MCS with it, MCS
completely stopped working.  Some construct I was using stopped generating
the proper code.  Rather than re-qualify and test that much Bliss code, I
simply started shipping the older Bliss .EXE on the MCS tape.  Ruffled a
few feathers but it was the only way I was ever going to get off the MCS
project, I didn't want that to become my life's work.

That was my only encounter with Bliss, ever.  Scarred me for life.  I stuck
with assembly (-10, -11, VAX) until the mid 80's when I had to learn Pascal
(don't ask)

If you defined FTLOGIN=0 and rebuilt the monitor, it eliminated the LOGIN
process.  You could simply walk up to any teletype, type Control-C, and
start working.

If you defined FTDISK=0 and rebuilt the monitor, it eliminated all the
disk drivers, making the monitor very very small.  In this case, you would
assign one of the DECtape drives as SYS: and run programs from DECtape.
(There was code in the monitor to test "is SYS: rewinding?" since nothing
else could be done until the DECtape I/O was complete.)

The TU7x series were the best tape drives I ever worked with.  Enormously
better then the TU10's and TU20's. We had so much trouble with the TU20's on
the KA, that one of our standard practices upon receiving release tapes from
DEC was to make a copy before doing anything else.  More than once the TU20
would "eat" a tape on a rewind.

When we had our first VAX arrive with a TU45, we felt almost like we were
back in the bad old days of the TU20s.   And apparently lots of other -10
and -20 sites must have complained to DEC about the lack of good tape drives
for VMS, since we got a contract from DEC to develop the device driver for
the TU7x's for VMS - we had the first set of TU7x drives dual ported between
a DECsystem-10 (via a DX10) and a VAX (via a DX20).

It occurred to me yesterday that this comment could have been
misunderstood.  It was not a commentary on Mr. Bush's ability
to do the work.  It was a commentary of DEC not using its own
experienced personnel.  My apologies, Nick.

Thanks to Storage Technology Corporation in Louisville, Colorado.
They made the best IBM-compatible tape drives around.  Very popular
at sites with IBM System/370 and compatible processors

DEC was smart enough to rebrand these tape drives with the Digital logo
and add a working MASSbus to bus-and-tag adapter.

I was our resident tape zealot at IUPUI (wherever that is), and while
I thought the TU78 was a great leap forward from what we had before*,
those IBM 3420 drives just a few steps away were the best transports I
ever saw -- they *never* failed to load, they *never* lost vacuum,
they ran like the wind, and the data were handled quite reliably too.
While using the TU78s I learned a lot of operational tricks you'll

For TU7x, you need to read TU70/71/72, NOT TU77 or TU78.  TU70/71/72 were
actually completely IBM compatible tape drives made by Storage Tech.  The
controller connected to IBM Tag&Bus cables.  DEC built a data
channel/controller called a DX10 (and later a DX20) which interfaced to the
STC controller via Tag&Bus on one side and DEC busses on the other:  the
DX10 connected to the -10's IO & Memory busses; the DX20 was a Massbus
connection.

The TU70/71/72 drives were high-quality, high-duty cycle tape drives that
worked better than any other tape drives DEC ever sold.

I got my start on DEC and PDP-10s at Carnegie-Mellon on a 4N50 system.
(That was before the name DECsystem10 or whatever came about.)  Five
DECtapes, 48 Kw of flaky core.  It supported two people quite well.
One sys tape, each user used two DECtapes, alternately as input and output.
Of course, with your source file moving back and forth between the two
tapes, you had to keep it's last location in mind!

I was hired as an operator in 1969 (I had just started my sophomore year).
I remember being intrigued that _one_ program sometimes started without
having to read the SYS tape - TECO.  It had a HISEG file but no LOSEG, and
if the hiseg was still in core, it started immediately.  Pretty impressive!

I had spent some time on the IBM 360/67 using both OS/360 and TSS/360.
One nice thing about the -10 was the lack of frivolous user accessible
configuration stuff.  If you were using the machine, you had to be
doing something useful.  On TSS you could tweak your keyboard map and
do lotsa other stuff that had absolutely nothing to do with productivity.
Sort of like setting Windows' background and screen saver today.

And there's even a BLISS link - compiling BLISS took all 39 K of memory
that was available, so we had to logout everyone.  I broke the build one
day by innocently doing a SYSTAT, forgetting that left me logged in with
SYSTAT's core image still around.

Eventually we got some RM10B (Bryant drums), more memory, RP02 disks,
etc.

No.  I asked this question when the HSC70 was first announced, and the reply
was a slightly stunned "Why would anyone want that?"

The RA81 HDAs were factory-formatted to 576.  No other drives--uh, check that,
no other Winchester-technology drives--were available that way.

Unless they're HSC50's, don't bother for a KL.

Hi Eric,
    There probably is no physical reason the later HSC can't do the job ,
but the CRONIC support for it was only in HSC50 and only
up to what I would call a old version of CRONIC. I think it says so in the
CRONIC release notes when it was removed. I can only find
my doco for later HSC's and you probably find you need certain rev requester
boards. If I dig it up I'll post it. Any one else have this
stuff and can reply ?

        Cheers
                Mark :)

I heard what you meant, if that helps.

What struck me about this is that DEC didn't use *anyone* to solve
this problem before customers felt it necessary to complain.
Apparently nobody understood that the TU7x were "real" tape drives and
the rest weren't, or that that was a real problem for shops used to
the kind of work that '10s did.  Someone should have realized that an
industrial-strength removable-storage product was a requirement in
order to be taken seriously in such shops, and made sure that DEC had
one ready to ship.  I know that DEC liked to have the customers lead
the way, and that's one thing I really appreciated in most cases, but
backup and offline storage are really too obvious to require much
leadership, no?

All of this is explained by the fact that VMS people were 
allergic to anything that had to do with PDP-10s.  If the -10
types did something, the original VMS types would go out of
their way to NOT do it.  That's why DEC went down the tubes.
There was a major NIH syndrome up north.

When I was young, foolish, and a bit impulsive, (and also responsible for MTA 
support in TOPS-10) I wrote a somewhat intemperate memo addressed to 
practically anyone who was anyone in 36-bit land. It was about the 
disreputable lack of serious tape products in the -10 product line. It ended 
with (if memory serves), "perhaps the best thing we can do for our customers 
who are serious about tape is give them STC's phone number."

I was told years later that this memo was the catalyst that got DEC talking to 
STC, resulting in the TU70s.

DEC invested money in replacing F40 with FORTRAN-10/20 because the
customers said it was necessary (just like those TU7x's).  The last I
heard, FORTRAN-10/20 had the highest PDP-10 market penetration of any
DEC layered product.

A product like FORTRAN-10/20 couldn't have been developed for nearly the
same cost in people, time and money without some implementation language
like BLISS-10.  What BLISS substitutes were already available on the -10
in the early 70's?

It should be said the the above referenced memo was written while we were

I don't recall that this happened. I'm also trying to recall where the KL was 
first powered up, Maynard or Marlboro. I know a lot of the design and 
engineering took place on 5-5 in Maynard, but can't recall where the first 
prototype was built and tested. Anyone? RCC, if you're still lurking perhaps 
you remember.

I don't remember moving the equipment to MRO that early; I always
thought it was '75 or so.  I do remember that the tape of the
20 vs. 10 trivia DECUS session showed that none of the panel
remembered either.  There was quite an argument :-).

Something that very few people know is how that equipment was moved
so quickly and successfully.  The guys in charge, Ed and Marty
(can't remember last names..Gillan and Vochel?) marked each piece
of equipment of all those systems with a "system color".  They
then plotted a unique path for each system to travel.  No one
door in either the Maynard or Marlboro plants had two systems
go through it.  So, if a box had, let's say, a blue color on it,
the blue path was taken from 5-5 out the blue door and into the
blue-marked trailer.  The blue trailer then was driven to the
blue door in Marlboro and the moving people took each blue
piece of equipment and followed the blue path to the blue
spot in the machine room.  

Knock down, transport and rebuilding the systems back up
to the point where they booted successfully took (I think)
less than 48 hours.  I do remember that TW didn't have an
interruption of his S/A time which was one of the criteria
that had to be met.

They might remember, too.  I was thinking about Alan Kotok, though.

We definitely moved to Marlboro in '73. I remember because DEC paid for each 
of the members of the Monitor Group to take a "business" trip after the 
successful completion of some release, the version number of which I can't 
recall. TW went to Australia, JMF to Europe, Lewine went to California (I 
think), and I went down south to race. I raced at Talladega and the Charlotte 
Motor Speedway on successive weekends in August 1974, travel courtesy of DEC. 
At that point we had been in Marlboro almost a year. When I got back from the 
trip I had a phone message which lead directly to my leaving DEC for First 
Data in September, 1974.

RCC still lurks:


Hi, John,

1)  I had long left DEC when the KL was first turned on.  I left in
    January, 1972.  No KL-s around then.

2)  Everyone was impressed at how much power a KL used.  It was amazing
    that DEC had stayed with linear power regulators at that stage
    of power supply technology.  The power plug was REALLY impressive.

    But even so, a KL system couldn't have sucked much more than
    a few times the power of a KI system.  So it strikes me
    as very unlikely that it took out any of the power system.
    Surely Marlboro had lots of KI's plugged in.

    And specifically, no I never heard of that happening (though, like I
    said, I wasn't there).

Yes.  That generation of TOPS10 people are diminishing.  I only
knew Al to say hi to him after he began working for the Fortran
group in the 80s (or was it late 70s?).  What I do remember
was the time that I convinced TW to go to one of Reed's parties;
getting TW or JMF to go was harder than pulling a very cross lion's
tooth for some reason.  Al was there.  And TW and Al must have
spent 2 hours just setting and quietly talking.  That was good
for TW.  

For some strange reason, I don't remember him when I was
editing the monitor.  He must have been in the background.

Story of my life. :-)

And I think the Monitor release we were rewarded for was 5.07/6.01. This 
is because I recall the work I did on DAEMON to make DUMP and DCORE work with 
VM. I debugged that stuff in the machine room on the second floor at Marlboro. 
Wasn't that the first release with VM support?

I remember Cliff, but I don't recall who took over DAEMON after the 6.01 work.

I recall 5.05 wasn't anything to write home about, but I don't recall a big 
disaster in 5.06. In fact I get a "warm and fuzzy" contemplating the number 
5.06.

> Who was the -10 supervisor then?

Good question. PFC was running all of TOPS-10 programming during the time I 
worked in Marlboro. He tried a brief experiment by hiring an outside guy to 
manage the Monitor Group. I can't even remember his name, but he had no 
previous -10 experience at all, and while a nice enough guy wasn't very 
effective. PFC then promoted another guy to run the Monitor Group, yet another 
name I can't remember. I do recall that he was about my height, dark 
complected, and had an annoying habit of invading people's (or at least my) 
personal space. He'd stand with his face about a foot from your's to talk to 
you. I had always treated him with the utmost contempt (even before his 
ascention) and complained bitterly to PFC about having to report to him, so 
Peter made a special deal and I got to report to someone else. Yet another 
name I can't recall. On further reflection, could the personal space invader's 
name have been Corbin?

DAEMON was considered the swappable part of the monitor.

There was also the file daemon (FILDAE) which extended file
protections and the accounting daemon (ACTDAE) which replaced
those gawdawful FACT files.

The reason they were called daemons was that they were programs
that invisibly worked in the background to do system functions.
The user address space wasnt' bothered.

	SUBTTL	DAEMON CALLS

I thought DAEMON core dump files were cool, at least potentially,
because they had fields for DDBs (device data blocks) - open file data
from the O/S which wasn't directly accessible through other means.

The "clock request" function made DAEMON send a WAKE back at you n
seconds later, I guess for potentially large n.

The first KLs were powered up in building 1.  In Maynard.
Yes the lights dimmed.  Boston Edison did come out and add some
capability.
DEC did have a bit to do with the second exchange being added to
maynard, the new ESS, and power upgrades!!

Building 1 was the one where the entire south wall was along the mill pond. 
It was reached via a three level bridge from Building 5. There were also a 
couple of bridges from Building 3, but I don't recall that these were ever 
opened. Down at the very end of Building 1 there was a connection to 
Building 21, also adjacent to the pond.

However, I don't ever recall any -10 stuff being in Building 1. If a KL was 
ever powered up in Maynard I'd guess it would have been on 5-5.

Ok, Building 1 had the first 8/e assembly line. The 9 and 15 lines.  It
was, I think on 1-4, where Cudamore had his office.  Down the hall from
Module Test.  yeah, it was next to the pond. I think Core memory test
was there too. More than one power supply that was not repairable fell
out the window into the pond.

On the first floor of Building 1 was the first real CAD setup.  Don't
you recall GOD - Graphics Online Delivery?  I recall 4 KLs on that
floor.  A couple of KIs.
CSS had their lab - where the first 11/20 (really 11/15 - no power fail
circuit) built for Aeroflot was put together.  The 8/e lab was just down
the hall in Building 1, next to building 5.

Yeah, when Alan Kotok, Vic Ku, and the rest of the crew were around, the
very First KL was in Building 5(5-5) BUT the install of Multiple KLs and
the KIs in 1-1 required a bit more service.

I can't recall who all the guys were...one guy had a lotus (the car!). 
It was before the purchase of Alberquerque and Arizona facilities -
before Stockebrand left DEComm-11 land.  Before the purple plague took
over.

Nope, I am not RCC.  I am just one of the bob smiths.

Then those KLs were not the first KLs.  Was that the CAD that was
headed  by Mr. Abel (I can't remember his first name, Tom?).
If it was they definitely weren't the first KLs.

Well, they couldn't have been the first KLs.  What software did they
run?  JMF and Dan Murphy did the CPU code and I know that was done
in Marlboro.  I think I wrote about the disaster of a diagnostic type
destroying the pack.

Barb, I know you're always complaining about your memory but I would have 
thought you'd have gotten this right. A lot of the operating system work for 
the KLs was done in Maynard, at least when initially the KL was going to be 
introduced with only one (new) OS. Dan Murphy lurks here and sometimes 
contributes, so he can confirm that he joined DEC while we were still in 
Maynard. I believe he brought TENEX through the VIROS and SNARK phases of its 
lifecycle while still in the mill. I can't recall when LCG (was it called LCG 
then?) finally gave approval to port TOPS-10 to the KL, but that might well 
have also been while we were still in Maynard. Dan, can you help with the 
chronology here?

No way!.  I joined DEC in July 1974.  At that point the -10 group
had moved to Marlboro long enough before so that no one talked about them
being in the mill.  I didn't join the group for 9 months.  At that time,
VIROS was the code name, it changed to SNARK, KRANS, and back to SNARK
all during my tenure in Marlboro.  Well, maybe SNARK came about when I
was was in MR one a week.

I can't recall what shape the KL was in when I moved to MR, otherwise I would
have piped up earlier.

Yeah, Lou Abel ran the 10 based Cad shop.
Who was spock? I can't recall.
I recall John DeRose working there, Lou, and some of the others.

After Marlboro opened and the PDP10 crew moved out, the 5-5 area was
taken over by a good sized contingent of the 11 software crew, RT and
RSX folks. The lab, on I guess it would be south end? of 5- (furthest
from the parking lot) there was a section for the PDP12.


Where was Pat Sullivan during this time?  Or Ron Bingham?  McClure? 
Rick Merrill was still in 8 land, had not done anything with GiGi yet. 
Vic Ku was working comm systems, PDP8 based comms front ends for the
10s.
When I started in 69, one of the first things I asked was why DEC was
not doing anything with ecl.  That caused a couple of folks to kind of
Jump.

My memory of that time is rusty, yeah, the first power up of MULTIPLE
KLs in 1-1, did cause some flickering, that might have been 73 or 74. 
The 1-1 rehab was quite nice at the time.

I think that parallelled (sorta) bldg 3.  I got my start on 3-5.  Hmm.
you might heve been the person who brought from "orientation" to my
cube on my first day at work on 3-5.

Ahh, here's my map.  Bridges went from 3-6 to 1-3.  I think 1-1 was where
the circuit board etching area was.  From 3-5 I went to 4-? to a bridge to
5-2, and down to 5-B (below mill pond level), past the salvage area
and turned left into the system 40 area, which was a dual KI system
when I showed up.

My map was my most important posession for the first three weeks.  After
the first week I tried taking a different route every day.

I imagine he must be referring to the hobbyist license.  All DEC's 36-bit
software was made available for noncommercial use.  You can find the
license on my web site or Joe's.

That's why I've on several occasions asked you by private email whether
you could supply copies of the DEC distribution tapes in your posession
(NOT the XKL versions); I have a legal license to obtain and use the stuff.

That all happened during the time that Peter Hurley was supervisor
of the -20 group.  The code names were the idiots' idea of keeping
the new OS development a secret.  All that subtrafuge was a PITA
because the same people who insisted on secrecy were the ones who
asked for special permission to talk to particular customers about
it.  Every coded name change produced manhours worth of work to 
run macros over the documents to reflect the latest.  It was also
caused by a reluctance of unknown persons to want to call the
product TOPS-anything.

I'll say it again.  At that time JMF and Dan were writing their
KLSERs and related code using the KLs that were in the 
engineering lab (not the software lab).  There were two KLs
there but I don't know if the second one was runnable at the
time.  There was a lot of contention between hardware and software
because the hardware types claimed to need the hardware to develop
the hardware but didn't seem to understand that they wouldn't
be selling a single CPU without the software.  I don't think
those hardware types ever learned because Jim ran into the
same problem later with one of the VAX flavors and Alpha.
We always had that problem with peripherals.  Marketing always
promised the first hardware to a customer but refused to let
software engineering have it hooked up to our systems before
first customer ship.  Then, when the hardware didn't work due
to no software, the fit hit the shan.  And it happened every
damn time.  Markerteers never had an ability to learn.

    I haven't been lurking that much recently, so I'm not sure I got
    the original question.  However, here are a couple salient
    timestamps:

    Jan 2, 1973 - I started at DEC as a regular employee.  For the 3
    months prior to that, I had worked on a fixed-price fixed-time
    contract to port TENEX to the KI-10.  As of Jan 2, John Leng and
    the other powers-that-be had already decided to do a "new" OS for
    the next generation of 36-bit hardware.  This decision got made
    during my 3-month contract when: (1) it became clear that TENEX
    really could be made to work on the KI-10, and (2) IBM announced
    "virtual memory", thus making all the DEC marketeers believe they
    hadda have it asap.  (I love it when things like this happen...)

    Over the course of the next few months, Peter Hurley joined me in
    the "new os" group.  We were working for the engineering manager,
    Fred Wilhelm, at the time, not for SWE under Peter Conklin.  Tom
    Hastings also began devoting most of his time to the project as I
    recall, although he continued to report to PFC.  Peter and I had
    offices on 5-5 along with the hardware engineers.  During the
    first year, Arnie Miller and Len Bosack joined the group also.

    March 1, 1974 (approx) - Our group moved to MRO.  This date is
    easy as it was about two weeks after our first (and only) child
    was born.  Sara and I had both been working in the Mill, but she
    was out on maternity leave when the move to MRO happened.  At the
    point we moved, I *think* I had had a small amount of access to
    actual KL-10 hardware, but I'm not real clear on that.  I think
    there was a prototype down the hall on 5-5 that I did a bit of
    hacking on.  We continued to use a KI-10 for quite a bit of the
    work of beefing up the OS that wasn't very machine-dependent.

    When we got to MRO, I think it was just the four of us (dlm, pmh,
    asm, lb) working directly on the OS.  Supervisors came and went,
    and I can't recall exactly when.  Tom Hastings was supervisor for
    a while when we were in the Mill.  Then, Howard Steadman was
    hired.  Lou Cohen was in there somewhere after we were in MRO, and
    then Dick Snyder.  Peter Hurley became supervisor when Snyder
    moved up.  I stayed as technical honcho through first few releases
    and only lost my good sense for a while in the early '80s when I
    was TOPS-20 supervisor for a year.

    Also, don't ask me to nail down dates for the various names!  Ugh.
    I know that Fred Wilhelm came up with VIROS while we were still in
    the Mill, and it was John Leng who always made it sound like VIRUS
    when he said it.  (Not intentionally; it just came out that way.)
    SNARK and the later name madness was foisted on us only after we'd
    moved to MRO though; of that I'm sure.

    (Hey, I just checked and viros.com is available!  Anybody want to
    grab it?  Such a cool name.  snark.com is taken, but it sucks
    anyhow.)

    Anyhow, hope that helps with some of the nostalgia.

The problem is that we don't have DEC distribution tapes, we only have licensed
source.  (Distribution tapes are just so much clutter if you aren't going to
use them.)  I wish I *could* provide such a service.

Dave McClure had done the comm stuff using the 8/e based comms
capabilities to replace the old 8i based stuff. I think Dave lurks here,
I am suffering a senior moment and can't recall that comm project using
the /e, DP8/e, KG8-ea, and some other bits. 

The 8e, and f were around (the m was not intended to have a switch front
panel) as was the 8/m.
The purple plague was in power, so it was politically correct to move
the former 8 based capabilities to the 11, AND to take advantage of the
emphasis on the 11 comm capabilities.  I don't recall the name of the
"window" that allowed you to have a unibus device hanging off the 10's. 
11/40 was fairly expandable, much more robust than the 20, and lots
cheaper than the 45, so ....
The DECComm-11 group was charged to create all the comm stuff = with Tom
Stockebrand and then Vince Bastiani leading the group.  8's, with the
MSB number properly just like the 10, were considered passe.  even tho
every single machine that could be built on the 8 lines was sold every
year.  Rueters kept coming in and buying rather large quantities.

If someone wants to check the history:
the original FPP8a, Don White's dual board FPP for the expanded omnibus,
ran rings around the 11/60, the 11/34a, the 11/40, and gave teh 11/70 a
good run for its money on fortran bench marks.

Don't forget about the dragon and hydra efforts - the attempts to merge
the 10 and 11 capabilities that really fueled the concept called Vax. 
The KL really spurred some research into an ECL 11, but the realization
that the 16bit word length and the limited address space, manufacturing
costs of the beast, and truly - market conditions  - we did have a bit
of a turn down a couple of times in the 70s  - kind of 

rambling mode off

   I don't know a whole lot about the DC76, but the DL-10 was a three
feet by three feet by six feet rack which supported a maximum of four
UNIBUS systems. They were "cool" devices.

   Didn't the DC76 attach directly somehow?

As long as my memory is valid that the DL-10 was a 10<=>11 memory
window, then that's what the DC76 used - KA-109 (BOCES/LIRICS) had a
DC76, and I read the DC76's (-11) assembly code.

And note, Alan, that that was a customer site.  Customers 
cobbed together quite unusual configurations to suit themselves.
I don't remember how we attached comm gear to our systems.  
WEX should be able to tell you what we supported since that
was the area he was supposed to be working on.  RDH could
tell us more.  

I don't remember a DL being hung off a KA but I didn't usually
keep track of hardware since the cybercrud seemed to change
with the phase of a marketeer.

It was.

On the discussion about -8 vs. -11 for KL10 console.  When that came
around, the PDP-8 comm gear was fading out and PDP-11s were de rigeur.
I made more sense to build a new KL10:PDP-11 interface to replace the
DL10 than to build a new PDP-8 interface.

   Oh, DL-10s got hung of KA-10s, believe me. When ADPNS had a presence
in Waltham we had a pair of KA-10s which were used as fast comms
controllers which each had a pair of DL-10s attached to them.

   The main systems "talked" to the KAs through shared memory, the
KAs "talked" to the -11s through the DLs, and the -11s "talked"
to the remote customer, frequently through another -11. It was a
very elegant solution at the time -- and fast as the blazes for some
stuff.

Dorry, but the LIRICS KA-10 used a DCA-680 based on the PDP/8-I formerly known
as ICC or "Chiquita" after the banana logo that hung on it when it was in a
storefront in 1969-1970

The KA-10 had *no* PDP-11/Unibus peripherals from the time of its installation
through its unfortunate and misguided decommissioning. It had eight DECTape
drives, four Memorex 2Meg disk drives, a DEC swapping drum, TU-10 magtape and
lots of core, all tied to the standard KA-10 bus system.

The later LIRICS  KL-10s (PDP-20s) were another matter Red, White, Blue and
Yellow each had a small PDP-11 front end.

It was expected that the KL-10 FE would have full diagnostic capabilities,
including the ability to use (by buss sharing) the KL-10 primary hard drive.
It was a design requirement that the FE be able to run these diagnostics
even
(especially?) if the KL was stone cold dead. Since lots of mbs of
diagnostics
were expected, that required something bigger than a floppy. In addition,
the
-FE had to be able to read/write the -10 boot device. Nobody really wanted
to write new drivers for the large hard drives.

It was considered easier to build good I/O devices and drivers for
the -11, and it was much easier to get diagnostics for them (the group of
sophisticated
-8 people at DEC was shrinking). The powers that beed wanted the KL10
diagnostics to run like the VAX/-11 diagnostics, because more field service
folk
were familiar with the -11 style. So that counted, and the FS group put an
experienced FS person who knew both architectures (Roland Belanger)
in the software design loop. So the cost of the FE CPU was really a very
insignificant part of the decision process..

After the -FE had been chosen, the purists insisted that the -11 FE run a
pure DEC realtime operating system. Well, the only good one around at
the time was RSTS, but it wasn't politically popular, so a mixed system
was created called RSX-20F, which pretended to be RSX-11 (some
parts of it actually were). By the time it was cobbled together, people
worried that it was getting pretty big, so an 11/40 looked like a safe
choice.

The lack of switches had nothing to do with it, since it was never expected
that they'd be used for anything. A group was imported from -11 land into
LCG, headed by "Bugsy" McLean (I may be spelling his last name wrong) to
do the initial software.

Again memories differ. There just wasn't much of an effort below the VP
level to merge the two CPU architectures, although there was very much an
effort to merge the peripheral architecture (hence OMNIBUS and its friends).
And there were sporadic efforts to integrate networking (which is an
entirely
different set of flame wars), and to provide remote file sharing services.

Basically, the world was divided into two camps. The first followed the
Gordon
Bell philosophy that there should be a happy family of machines with
wordlengths
based on powers of two and with software designed by the pure of heart and
goto-less of mind. The other group thought that the native machine language
was
important because really fast routines had to be hand-coded, and the quicker
the
code the better. Their hearts weren't pure and their minds were filled with
goto's
(how many kinds can you name on the KL-10?).

So as I remember it, the choice of -FE was very much an engineering choice
and
not driven by politics. But then, at that time I wasn't much involved in the
politics... so
I may have missed it.

   I'd like to thank everybody who commented on that last brain-fart
of mine (of having an -8 as the KL's front-end) for clearing up quite
a bit of mystery surrounding the choice of the 11/40.

   One of the bits I'd forgotten was that the -11 wasn't _just_ for
spoon-feeding the KL its brains at power-on (and tickling it when it
was sick) but was also expected to play a part in day-to-day operation
of the system by supporting comms lines and such. I'd conveniently
forgotten about that capability since I'd never seen anything other
than the console TTY and diagnostic bits like DECtape and an RP04/6
wired to the -11.

   Also, as the KL never was a favourite of mine, I probably slept
through one too many classes.... (I always preferred the KI -- they
had character.)

Check out the interview that a guy from the Smithsonian had with Bill Gates at:

		http://innovate.si.edu/history/gates/gatestoc.htm

In the interview, he says that they used the 8008 in their Traf-O-Data system.
He says that the 8008 was too weak to do BASIC, and he wanted to do a BASIC
system like on the PDP-8 that he used before.

Personally, I liked the Seymour Cray interview much more.  It is at:

According to the Bill Gates interview conducted by the Smithsonian, Paul Allen
wrote Macro-10 macroes to get the 8080 assembly language assembled.  He also
wrote an 8080 emulator in Macro-10 so they could test the code for Altair BASIC.
Paul also (according to Gates) did something to DDT on the -10 to allow it to
understand the assembly macroes.

Anyone who wants more info should look at the interview at:

		http://innovate.si.edu/history/gates/gatestoc.htm

The section titled "Writing an Altair Basic" discusses this part.

Harvard most definitely was a customer.  They also had PDP-1s, and gave
me a programming manual for it.

Harvard was also on the ARPAnet early on and CMU ported their code
before I graduated and took over the ARPAnet code.  As the
replacements for the "old" telnet and FTP protocols appeared, I did
the client side at CMU and Ed Taft did the server side at Harvard.

Ed was also the author of the TULIP I/O package.  I came up with the
name, documentation and got it into DECUS.  Ed had called it the
futility package (for file utility), and I thought it deserved better.

Eventually Ed went to Xerox PARC and I went to DEC.  I remember one
night at DEC logged into Harv-10 when Ed and I were helping someone
at Rutgers getting the 3rd TOPS-10 site running on the ARPAnet.  The
biggest problem was that he had a KI and some of the code had to change
due to page map issues.

They used the Harvard -10 for the Altair project, if I remember correctly.
According to what I have to consider a reliable source (PA himself), they used
-10's and -20's at Microsoft as development platforms for quite a long time.
They hired several LOTS students on the strength of their Tops-20 programming
exposure in the mid-80's.

In 72-73 or so, every release of MACRO-10 was greeted by a flurry of SPRs from
Harvard.  Specifically from Ed Taft (now at PARC?), who liked to do really
{hairy, cute, ...} macros.

I didn't do work that dealt with customers until 75 or so.  That
name is vaguely familiar.  Story time....

Whenever JMF wrote macros (I remember some effort for the monitor
and he wrote the macros for my accounting project), he would
work and work and work on them.  Invariably, he would throw up
his hands, take a walk over to Nixon's office, and then Dave
would be debugging for at least a week.  There was definitely
an art to writing those things :-).

Dunno, wasn't there.

By the time they bought QDOS from Seattle Computer (I think I remember that
name correctly), Gates wasn't doing any day-to-day programming, and I doubt
that Allen was, either.

The impression I've gotten from a conservation with Paul Allen is that he did
real PDP-10 programming on a job he had before Microsoft, but it may not have
been up to your high standards, Barb.

The CR and what was it CM, were first done on the 8/e. John McNamara - I
think, could be wrong - was the project engineer. I think John did the
interface design, and I got to make the optical and the pin versions to
work properly.  There was a minor problem with the power supply in the
readers, we used to be able to get them to read cards with AC line
noise.

We - well a couple of us - worked out a scheme to drive new england
telephone crazy with those beasts...
It is amazing what happened to the readers when you put just a little
butter on the old punch card telephone bill....

Hmm.  Is this any relation to the SAIL editor called E?  I know that the code
in the monitor supporting E was ported to Tops-10 at some point.

There pretty tough to find now, given that they are around 25 years old.

MUCH tougher, though, is the second-generation DEC VS60. I've owned several
VT11's, but I've never even SEEN a VS60. At one point I had the VS60 print
set, pretty sophisticated vector generator. Not ever been at DEC, I've wondered
who bought them, or if they were used with SUDS.

There are still a few around, but I doubt they're for sale. Eric Smith just
showed his GT40 at the Vintage Computer Fair. At this point, a simulator seems
the only way that most folks will ever see this device in operation.

Wasn't that the technique used on some MS/DOS sw to establish a link

that time)?

I'm posting this exchange at the suggestion of /BAH, prefacing it with
the comment that it's from the vaguely cloudy times long past of
a universe far far away...

[from /BAH]
Was this a long, long time ago?  Like when we were still in
the Mill?  I remember a story that a source was gone (I'd
have to look at MAC files to find it so somebody took the
SAV and typed in the equivalent MACRO.  At least, that
was the explanation for the gag-awful code format :-).

Post it on the PDP10; maybe Bob Clements will contribute :-).
He's about the only one (other than John Everett) who goes back
that far.  Or would you like me to post the question?
------------------------------

[Remainder from PAG]

Now that /BAH mentions it, I remember someone (maybe Tony)
suggesting that we decompile the executable and write a new
source from it. The only scenario in which I could believe that
was actually done was if some management nitwit ordered
that ALL code had to be compiled from MACRO sources.

<Brief aside from PAG>
It happened that at that time that there was this certain
management nitwit who might have actually ordered such a
thing ... names will be withheld because he may have improved
over the years, but some of you might remember him... he didn't
last long in LCG and was bubbly with enthusiasm and had taken
a degree in computer engineering management-- one of the first
such awarded (for people whom it hurt to think). Ultimately
Valdeane Alusic and I and a few others (about everyone who'd
dealt with him) conspired to get him promoted into some marketing
position in smallcomputerland.
</End of brief aside>

Anyway, to return to the sourceless CUSP, I vaguely remember it
as something with lots of "bugs" for which people had found
workarounds over the years and which therefore couldn't be corrected
in a new version without breaking lots of other stuff (like batch files). So
PIP comes to mind as the likely candidate. It might, on reflection, have
been
a particular *version* of PIP which did something peculiar for a certain
discontinued or unsupported device.

Footnote: For those of you who don't admit to going back that
far (or whose memories have different fade spots), PIP
was "Peripheral Interchange Program" and did basically what
cat does in Un*x (copy data from one place to another). It had a
fair number of strange and sometimes documented behaviors, sometimes
controlled by switches.

Local File Transfer Using PIP

Function

The PIP program transfers files between standard I/O  devices  at  the
local system.  It can perform simple editing and magnetic tape control
operations during transfer operations.


Format

     R PIP
     * output file-spec(s)/switches = input file-spec(s)/switches

where:  * is the PIP prompt; output file-spec and input file-spec  are
        file specifications which may include wildcards; and = (equals
        sign) separates the output from the  input  files.   You  must
        include this, even if you omit either file specification.

/switch  is  one  or  more  of  the  options  described  below.   Each
description  includes  any  restrictions on combining that switch with
other switches.

Switch      Meaning

/A          Does not split lines between output buffers;  starts  each
            line with a new word.  Used for FORTRAN ASCII input.  This
            switch may be used with /C, /E, /G, /M, /N,  /O,  /Q,  /S,
            /V, and /Z.

/B          Copies in binary mode.  This switch is legal with /G,  /M,
            /P, /Q, and /X.

/C          Deletes trailing spaces and converts  multiple  spaces  to
            tabs.   You  can  use this switch with /A, /E, /G, /J, /M,
            /N, /O, /Q, /S, /T, /V, /W, /X, and /Z.

/D          Deletes one or more files  from  the  destination  device.
            You  can  only specify a destination device in the command
            string.  You may use the /X switch with /D.

/E          For card reader input, ignores card sequence numbers.   In
            other  words,  this  switch replaces characters in columns
            73-80 with spaces.  This switch can be used with  the  /A,
            /C, /G, /J, /M, /N, /O, /Q, /S, /X, and /Z switches.

/F          Gives a limited (fast) version of the  directory  for  the
            specified device.  You may not use any other switches with
            this one.

/G          Ignores I/O errors and continue processing  after  issuing
            an error message.  This switch is always legal.

/H          Copies in image binary mode.  You can use /H with /G,  /M,
            /X, and /Z.

/I          Copies in image mode.  You can use this  switch  with  /G,
            /M, /X, and /Z.

/J          Converts    non-printing     control     characters     to
            control-character  format  for  terminal output.  That is,
            001, <CTRL/A>, is output as ^A.  /A, /C, /E, /M,  /W,  and
            /X are permitted with this switch.

/L          Lists the directory for the  specified  device.   You  may
            only use /Z with this switch.

(Mx)        Magnetic tape switches, enclosed in parentheses.  They are
            listed  below.   You  may  not use /D, /F, or /U with this
            switch.

            Switch         Meaning

            (M8)           800 bpi density (default value)
            (M5)           556 bpi density
            (M2)           200 bpi density
            (ME)           Even parity (odd parity is default)
            (M#nA)         Advance tape  reel  n  files.   #n  omitted
                           means one file.
            (M#nB)         Backspace tape reel n  files.   #n  omitted
                           means one file.
            (M#nD)         Advance tape reel n  records.   #n  omitted
                           means one record.
            (M#nP)         Backspace tape reel n records.  #n  omitted
                           means one record.
            (MW)           Rewind tape reel.
            (MT)           Skip to logical end-of-tape.
            (MU)           Rewind and unload.
            (MF)           Mark end-of-file.

/N          Deletes line sequence numbers from an ASCII file.  If  tab
            follows  the  sequence  number, deletes the tab also.  You
            may use /A, /C, /E, /G, /M,  /Q,  /X,  and  /Z  with  this
            switch.

/O          Resequences or adds line  sequence  numbers  to  an  ASCII
            file,  incrementing by 1.  You may use /A, /C, /E, /G, /M,
            /X, and /Z with this switch.

/P          Converts  FORTRAN  format  control  characters  for   line
            printer listing.  You may use /B and /Z with this switch.

/Q          Lists a summary of switches on the specified device.   You
            may not use /Q with /D, /F, /R, and /V.

/R          Renames the source file to the  name  of  the  destination
            file.  /X may be used with /R.

/S          Resequences or adds line  sequence  numbers  to  an  ASCII
            file,  incrementing  by  10.   /A,  /C, /T, and /Z are all
            valid with /S.

/T          Deletes trailing spaces from the transferred file.   Keeps
            one  space  and  the line termintor for an all-space line.
            You may use /C, /S, and /Z with this switch.

/U          Obsolete.

/V          Matches angle brackets.  If there is  an  unmatched  angle
            bracket, creates a file listing those lines with unmatched
            angle brackets.  You may use /G, /M, and /Z with /V.

/W          Converts tabs to spaces.  /C and /Z are  legal  with  this
            switch.

/X and /DX  Copies  the  specified  files  without  concatenating  the
            files.   /DX  copies  all but the specified files.  If you
            omit the /X  switch,  PIP  concatenates  the  files  while
            copying.  You may not use /F or /L with this switch.

/Y          Obsolete.

/Z          Zeroes the  directory  of  the  destination  device.   PIP
            attempts  to  delete all the files named in the directory,
            depending on the protection codes.  You may not  use  this
            switch with /D or /R.

PIP can transfer files in either ASCII or binary mode.  PIP  uses  the
file  extension  in  the file specification to determine which mode to
use.  Whenever possible, PIP transfers files in a binary mode since it
is faster.  The binary modes are:  binary, image, and image binary.

PIP performs a specific series of tests on a file extension  in  order
to  determine  the mode to use during a transfer operation.  PIP looks
for:

      o  The presence of a data mode switch.  If no switch  is  found,
         PIP goes to the next test.

      o  The presence  of  a  known  (standard)  file  extension  that
         specifies a binary mode of transfer.  If no binary extensions
         are found, PIP goes to the next test.

      o  The input and the output devices specified, to  determine  if
         they  are  capable of handling binary data.  If either of the
         devices cannot handle binary, the transfer is made  in  ASCII
         mode.   If  both  devices can handle binary data, PIP goes to
         the next test.

      o  The presence of the /X switch in the command string; if it is
         found,  the  transfer is made in binary mode.  If an X option
         is not found, PIP goes to the next test.

      o  The  presence  of  commas  (non-delimiters)  in  the  command
         string;  if commas are found, ASCII mode is indicated.  If no
         commas are found, the transfer is made in binary mode.


Characteristics

The PIP program:

     Requires LOGIN.

     Destroys your core image.

     Places your terminal at user level.


Examples

     1.  Run PIP, and list your directory on your terminal.

              .R PIP
              *TTY:/L=

     2.  Transfer files from area [11,7]  to  your  directory  without
         concatenation.

              *DSK:/X=DSK:[11,7]filea.rel,filea.mac

     3.  Combine all the files on the tape on MTA0:  into one file  in
         your directory.

              *DSK:TAPE.MAC=MTA0:*

     4.  Rename the file MONI.MAC to MONI.CBL

              *DSK:MONI.CBL/R=MONI.MAC

     5.  Change the directory access code of [57,123] to <222>.

              *DSKA:[57,123].UFD<222>/R=[57,123].UFD

     6.  Transfer a file from MTA1:  to MTA2:  at 200  bpi  with  even
         parity.

              *MTA2:(M2E)=MTA1:(ME2)

     7.  Backspace MTA0:  to the start of the previous file.  (MB)  is
         equivalent to (M#1B).

              *MTA0:(MB)=

     8.  Backspace MTA2:  to the start of the current file.

              *MTA2:(M#0B)=

I don't see how PIP could mess up batch files.  By the time
there was a batch, Pete Conklin had started his coding 
standard, I think.  John?  When did that memo come out 
that talked about using symbols instead of number for AC
assignments, etc. 

I had forgotten that Valdeane was around.  Perhaps somebody
could nudge her to read this particular thread?  <hint, hint> :-)

I think you're referring to LEVELD.MEM (written by Tom Hastings), which 
defined the coding standards to be used in the creation of the Level-D monitor 
(4S72 to 5.01 transition). Monitor AC usage was rationalized during this 
transition by (if memory serves) Don Black. Prior to Level-D, ACs weren't 
necessarily referred to by number, but the names weren't consistant across 
modules. If I rack my brain enough I can probably come up with most of the old 
names, but off the top of my head I recall PDP, TAC, TAC1, DDB, etc. As to the 
date of the memo, I'm guessing 1969 or 1970.

>I had forgotten that Valdeane was around.  Perhaps somebody

I had forgotten the lovely Valdeane entirely. Hadn't thought of her in perhaps 
twenty-plus years, but seeing her name in this thread brought back all kinds 
of memories. Is she really still around somewhere? It's pretty amazing how the 
brain works. Thinking about Valdeane brings back all kinds of other names and 
faces from that era, also people I haven't thought about in lo these many 
years.

We (the RT-11 development team) did not do DECnet... that was
another group.  And the version for RT-11 was most certainly
not BLISS... I was part of a group which looked at the feasability
of getting DECnet/RT up to Phase IV/Ethernet... it was most
certainly MACRO-11...

Excuse me?  There wasn't even a reasonable BLISS for RT-11
at the time (was there ever?)  It required cross-compilation
on something like a VAX...

Although we did use an RSX system (and even a VMS system)
to do base-level builds of RT-11... we didn't *have* to...
We could built it on RT-11 running on an -11.  We couldn't
have done that if we did it with BLISS...

So I remember many of us simply ignored the BLISS issue,
saying that if they ever got a BLISS which ran on RT-11
that we could use for a real build, we'd reconsider it,
but not until.

Never heard of it.  FILDAE was a midnight hack.
SMP started out as a midnight hack.  A lot of the
DDT stuff was literally a midnight hack ('ey, Bob :-)).
RUNOFF was a midnight (I think 'ey, the other Bob :-)).
McComas' TECO work was a midnight hack (at least the
bugs we in Tape Prep needed fixes for were done in
his spare time).

Maybe we should define midnight hacks.

There was that one.  But Conklin established another standard
(I don't remember seeing a memo, but I wouldn't have received
since I wasn't a programmer back then) for CUSPs.  It might
have been a side effect of this WILD and SCAN hacks.  Some
of the naming conventions (P instead of PDP for AC17) might
have been based on the Level D spec.  I sure wish I had
been dishonest and packed all that stuff away and brought
it home.

And the stories.  After most of the people at TW's going
away party went home, a few of us stayed sitting at a
table.  TW and Pat White got together and just started talking
while reading the listing of DTASRX.  One comment in the
listing would remind TW of something; that would remind Pat
of something; that would remind TW of something.  And it
just went on and on.  It's one of the special times I
remember with great fondness [bittersweet emoticon here].

I'm sorting through some TOPS-10 distribution tapes, and I
see that 7.03, 7.03A, and 7.04 are all present in various mixes
of distributions/CUSPS/sources/monitors/tools/autopatch tapes.  Out of
curiosity, what *was* the last DEC release of TOPS-10?  If 7.04 was
the last, were there ever any autopatch releases for it?

Gene was kidding then. Or Charlie was kidding when he told Gene.

It was called System 1022 when I first started using it at First Data,
where Gene and John and I worked in the mid-seventies. 
For years, Software House was two guys, Charlie H. and Andy Garland.
It was originally written at night using borrowed or bartered time
from the FDC KA-10s. I can't remember when I started using it, but
it was the mainstay of FDC's govenment business by 75, well before
Tenex became renamed as Tops-20 and offered on the horrible 96KW
KL-20A's with core memory. (Late 77?). So the 20 part of
the name predated DecSystem-20 by a couple of years (unless
LCG could keep a secret for years -- nah...).

Gene also claimed that it was called 1022 because it first worked or
was sold, or demoed (depending on the story's version) on Oct 22.
Of course, while it was being named, Gene was a Macro-10 assembly
programmer at FDC, not a marketing dude building brand equity.

I believe it is true that their Vaxen product was called System 1032
because it was based on 1022 and ran on hated 32 bit machines.

7.04 was the last release though 7.05 went out as either an Autopatch
or TSU tape.  I was involved more with TOPS-20 at the time so I
forget if it identified itself as 7.05 or if that was an internal
designation.

There were several Autopatch updates and 3 or 4 TSU tapes.  I also
have a patch or two which didn't make the last tape (LPTSPL or some
such as I recall.)  Details are buried somewhere for the moment.

Yeah, well, that's the rub.  Doug Jones wrote up his efforts to
preserve of PDP-8 paperbacks, and he begins:

  Once you have concluded that a paperback is beond repair,
  the first step in preserving its contents
  is to complete its destruction. Slice off the glued
  spine of the paperback so that the pages come
  apart as separate sheets. You can cut the sheets
  from the spine with an X-acto knife, or you can
  find a shop with a paper shear that will cut the spine loose.

Doug then goes into a very detailed step-by-step description of
producing an archival-quality duplicate of the original information.
For further details on Doug's efforts, see

If you do not wish to gillutine the books and scan the pages, the alternative
is deacidification, specifically W'ei T'o liquid available from Light
Impressions and other museum supply companies.

The liquid, applied with any kind of airless sprayer system, loads a page with
a transparent alkali (usually a magnesium compound) that neutralizes current
acid levels and provides a buffer to neutralize further acids produced by
lignin breakdown.

The price is rather high, $40+ a pint, though the excess material can be
recycled if you use a spray booth, and a little goes a long way. Contact Light
Impressions at their 800-number (not in front of me this second) for further
details.

Basically, you spray each page with the minimum required to do the job, allow
the excess to drip off and recycle. I believe that real problems develop if
you use the immersion technique on multi-page documents.

Books can also be sent to mass-deacidification firms used by libraries, but
the cost is even higher than doing it yourself (The Library of Congress had a
really neat system for doing the job except it relied on a gas that ignited in
the presence of water vapor, requiring books to be placed in a vacuume
chamber, pumped down and the gas introduced and then removed. The program was
unfortunately scrubbed when the failure of the prototype system (gas removal
function) required the Navy to blow up the prototype in situ. If continued, it
would have reduced the proce to making a book capable of lasting two centuries
to $10 per volume.

And a belated one from [10,77] on System 2 (the development KA at DEC).

BTW, when I joined DEC I was assigned [16,23] on the PDP-6. When the -10 came 
along we got to pick our own Programmer Number to go with Project Number 10. 
TW picked [10,10], perhaps because he was at the time working on the 
(stillborn) 10/10 monitor.. I kind of liked [10,77] because it was easy to 
type and was the largest two digit Programmer Number available; octal, you 
know. :-) JMF joined DEC later and got assigned [10,675] if memory serves. Is 
this right, BAH?

It was pure serendipity that [10,77] later became a model number.

Cooler heads?  From what I hear, KRANS reverted to SNARK because

Sigh!  SNARK came before KRANS.  The reason more developer time
was spent on renaming SNARK was because the name tripped off the
lips of a customer.  If customers knew the secret code of
the developement effort, then it wasn't secret anymore.  I have
no idea why secrecy was such a high priority when non-disclosures
were being reissued left and right.

Does anyone remember the Hunting of the Snark party hosted
by Tim Stein, Valdeane Alusic, etc. on the 100th Anniversary
of the original publication date? I still have the invitation
for the party (an agony in 10 fits).

The highlight of the party was, of course, the ritual reading
of the entire hunting, from a first edition.

The book was published in 1876, so that the party was
(logically) in 1976. I know that in 1972 or so I began
putting quotes from The Hunting into comments in the
TOPS-10 monitor sources and into code and documentation
in varous DEC utilities I was forced (um, urged) to maintain later,
and we heavily sprinkled them throughout the TYPESET-10 sources
and documentation, starting in 1972.

The original comment on the keep-alive counter code that
RSX-whatever-F checked for the KL front end, when the
-10 stopped incrementing, was "Snark was Boojum-Call
Bellman." It was removed over my objection as too obscure.

This isn't in any way to take credit for the internal use of the
name for the SNARK project. The book and the term were
popular among -10 enthusiasts at the time. In the late 60's
when people called a a program "snarked" everyone knew
exactly what was meant, "Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder
sometimes."

Hmmm, you mention 1978 - that sounds right for 7.01 but not for
the KL.  I worked at Marlboro in 1974 and 1975 and the 1025/1026
(I think those were the serial numbers) appeared while I was there.
I know this was the case 'cause I got to fix BASIC which, being a
good, old style program, made use of the extra bits in BLT pointers
which were being absconded with by the new segment stuff.

One of the flavors of 6-level monitors supported KLs.  However,
they ran master/slave and turned out to be, IIRC, slower than
master/slave KI when comparing actually work getting done.

Yea.  Looking back on it now, we quickly got used to reconfiguring
systems on the fly for stand-alone, field service, etc.

Just for clarification, 1025 wasn't the "other" CPU.  It was
1042.  1025 was the hardware engineering CPU.

Bob -- the rumor I heard at DEC was about 1984.

DEC was to merge with AT&T -- killed by AT&T telling Ken Olson they were
going to put in place the senior DEC mgmt... K.O. told em to go scratch
(supposedly).

At the same time DEC was working an outsource deal with AT&T to supply
all Sysadmin and Operations personnel into Bell Labs to admin the 
Unix machines... (I was being considered a position as a Unix admin
as part of that...)

Amazing since Lucent's done the outsource with IBM Global Services
and here I am in Bell Labs doing Sysadmin direct for Lucent 15 years
after the rumor.

If DEC and AT&T merged and DEC was in charge of hardware there might
never have been the spread of Unix to DEC competitors... Who knows.
This may have avoided the spread of HP-UX boxes and Apollo might have
remained successful with Domain/OS.

Compaq could've been just another PC company.

Sun might have had cheap DEC/AT&T Unix boxes to compete with and DEC and
AT&T microsystems might have had the Alpha out without building the
costly (now Intel) fab plant.

Is there a decent list of dates and features of TOPS-10 versions?

I don't see much of one on Joe's nice page.  (It references Compaq's
Digital timeline pages - which don't get it right either.  They show
a picture of a KI-10 in 1971 as the first DECsystem-10 and another
picture in 1972 as the first KI-10. :-)  They also tout DECNET in
1975 neglecting ANF-10.)

I'd be willing to take a wild stab at it; though I was mostly only a
user, only active from 73 to 81, and have only a KI-10 reference
card left from my collection :-(

TECO had screen editing at least by 1964, according to a manual that
you can read at

  http://www.pobox.com/~enf/lore/teco/teco-64.html

At that point TECO seems to have run standalone rather than under any
operating system; by the July, 1965 revision it seems to have picked up
some operating system support.

The first screen editor that I am aware of, though, was not TECO but
"M856.  EDITING TEXT FOR IMMEDIATE DISPLAY" written by Martin E. Somin
of the MIT Electrical Engineering Department in 1959.  It is described
as follows in Progress Report Number 6 of the Research and Educational
Activities in Machine Computation by the Cooperating Colleges of New
England, MIT Computation Center, January, 1960:

   This problem will be concerned with designing a computer program
   that will allow editorial work on a given piece of text in such
   a manner that the text in its edited form is immediately available
   in a visual display.  This example of man and machine interaction
   may prove useful in editing commercial copy.

   The program will allow both additions and deletions of text,
   punctuation marks, spacing and capitals at any point in the original
   text.  As additions and deletions are made, all words in the text
   will automatically shift so as to keep the margins uniform.  Any
   words making for more than a predetermined number of characters on
   a line will be shift [sic] to the next line of text.  In the case of
   additions to the text, material run off the bottom of the page would
   be stored in a separate memory for use in starting the next page.
   This run off text will not ordinarily appear in the visual display.

It depends what you count as a "full screen editor."  TECO was displaying the
buffer on the screen in the early 60s (starting on the PDP-1), but you typed
a sequence of (terse) commands and the whole sequence took effect at once
when you finished (with ALT ALT).  Single-keystroke editing in TECO started
with "real time edit mode" around 1970 or so but I think TVEDIT at Stanford
was earlier than that.

P.S.  What I miss most from the PDP-10 is the ability to debug a crashed
kernel and revive it!  And of course the open-source nature of all the
software.  And, when it comes to teaching students about machine organization,
I miss the fact that an address can fit in an instruction.  :-)

No, on second thought, what I miss most is the fact that writing a file with
the same name as an existing file creates a new one, not seen by readers
until it's closed!  This is the most crucial thing that Unix got wrong, imho,
and Dos got it even more spectacularly wrong, from which we still suffer
in Windows.

For what it's worth, Dan Murphy has denied that PDP-1 TECO used the
display.  I would love to see code or documentation for PDP-1 TECO
proving either that it did or did not have display support.

And indeed, you can read about TVEDIT in "THOR--a display based time
sharing system" by John McCarthy, Gary Feldman, and John Allen in the
proceedings of the 1967 Spring Joint Computer Conference.  As documented
there, it supported the following editing commands:

  n space       move right n characters
  n backspace   move left n characters
  n return      move down n lines
  n K           delete n characters or lines
  n G           go to page n
  P             insert page mark
  I             enter insert mode
  W             get next display window
  F             finish editing

According to the bibliography attached to that article, TVEDIT existed
in March, 1965.

The 1964 manual is for PDP-6 TECO and only says that *most* of the
ideas were taken from the PDP-1 version.  The display support might
have been one of the ideas that was ported from the PDP-1 to the
PDP-6, or it might have been a new feature.

It's a little more complex than that.

In a sense, there is no such single thing as "ITS" or "the ITS
software".  There was never any ITS "distribution" or anything, 
nor was ITS any kind of product, nor (contrary to the silly claims
on this newsgroup) was ITS a deliverable item on a Government contract.  
(And as someone pointed out, that would not automatically make it
public domain or Government property anyway.)  There is no set of
files or directories which can clearly be identified as "ITS";
it's all mixed together with personal stuff.  That means that your
first job would be to determine who holds the copyrights to all the
pieces that you want to make copies of.  That also implies that you
know what the pieces are that you need.

It is very likely that MIT holds the copyrights to everything that is
needed to bring up a running ITS.  However, sorting out what those
pieces are, and distinguishing them from pieces of private materials
(software, documentation, and other files) that MIT might not own, 
and also filtering out other kinds of personal material, is a job
that can really only be accomplished by certain people at MIT.

If you were to take that upon yourself, you would be incurring all
the legal liability that goes with it.  And if you were not personally
intimately involved with the materials at the time, how do you imagine
you would know for sure what you're looking at?  In addition to
copyright issues, you could easily get into other kinds of legal
problems involving areas like invasion of privacy.  There could
potentially hundreds of people involved in legal actions.  
Do you have enough lawyers to back you up on a project like this?

Anyway, there are people working with MIT to create a sanitized ITS
distribution for people who would like this historical artifact.
They are mostly not getting paid, and are doing it for personal reasons. 
This also means that they are not in a big pressured hurry to do it.
When they have something ready, they will also have to get it past the
MIT lawyers, who must be confident that MIT will not get into trouble
by accidently releasing things that they shouldn't.

My advice would be to wait for them to get around to it, and not bug them.
There is no release schedule for this.  It will be a gift when it happens.

One of my earliest encounters with UNIX left a real bad impression with
me.  This was in V6 PDP-11 days.  A UNIX developer (who shall go nameless)
was having trouble implementing Telnet protocol.  It's not easy to do
Telnet right; the obvious implementation will set you into a protocol
loop.

So he picked my brains for how I did it in ITS and TOPS-20; I wrote the
standard Telnet client for both systems, although there were earlier
implementations.  At the time, my algorithm was considered to be the best
way to do Telnet, since it would get the protocol right and didn't have
deadlock problems.  When I outlined the algorithm, I could see him become
crestfallen, because what I described was unimplementable in the UNIX of
that time (it still is unimplementable in many UNIX variants running
today).

In brief, my algorithm had two processes sharing writeable memory to
communicate state.  Rather than have an "option pending" state (which is
very difficult to do right!), I simply had an "enabled" or "disabled" for
each Telnet state.  If I initiated a state change, I would simply send the
protocol to change the state and immediately set the state.  The protocol
receiving process would simply ignore any protocol that did not change the
state; if the protocol would change the state, it made the change and sent
back the answer.

The key was in using shared writeable memory, so interprocess
communication was possible without any deadlocks; furthermore, that there
be no queueing of the interprocess communication.  In other words, a
change that was overwritten by a subsequent change would essentially
disappear.

Tests demonstrated that the shortcut of not having the "option pending"
state didn't make any difference in the (correct) protocol dialog or in
user behavior.  Even Jon Postel agreed that it was a neat solution to the
problem.  Jon was normally quite a purist.

UNIX Telnet had to do it a different way, and anyone who's ever looked at
it will see just how hairy it ended up before they got it right.  
Fortunately, the versions that got it wrong are mostly extinct (although
not on my 3B1...).

Today, of course, you could do my algorithm on UNIX systems which have
threads.  But this is now, and that was then; and nobody really feels a
compelling need to rewrite UNIX Telnet now.  Most UNIX programmers still
don't comprehend the use of shared writeable memory between threads.

Well, gee.  The old telnet protocol was retired around 1974, the new
started showing up around 1973 (I implemented the client half on
TOPS-10, Ed Taft at Harvard implemented the server half).
The "r" commands in BSD Unix were part of teaching Unix about the ARPAnet
and happened much later.  The "r" commands are very much Unix-specific.

That's for the old protocol.  I think the new protocol got started around:

RFC 0461 - Telnet Protocol meeting announcement (February 14, 1973)

At least I worked on it in the 73/74 timeframe.  The old protocol is
so different it really deserves a different name.

Our implementation gave Harvard and CMU reputations as the fastest systems
around, as it was all implemented in interrupt level code.  I used
coroutines to handle decoding options split across message boundaries, as
I couldn't readily write code to "fetch the next character".  So I
just swapped PCs between interrupt code that stepped through each received
octet and code that decoded the octet stream.  I was quite delighted
to find a very good use for the PDP-10 coroutine instruction (JSP AC,0(AC)).
It was much like a state machine that used the PC as the state variable.

Ah yes.  I wrote a lot of code before going to New York City over
Thanksgiving in 1973 during the first of the oil crunches.  Trying to
find gas on the Sunday we returned was not fun.  It was a couple weeks
later before I had time to type in the code.  I wrote code on paper
and added comments as I typed.  It took me over a day to figure out
what I had written!  However, it came up quickly and was very solid.
I may have been the only site that was ready on the original changeover
date (Feb 1974?).

>Admittedly, Telnet has changed a lot in the past three decades,

Telnet has changed remarkably little since the new protocol was designed.

Not at all.  Unless one posts that claim in these newsgroups.  :-)

Damn, I miss coroutines!  I too was a big user of the JSP instruction for
coroutines.  The Dialnet protocol drivers, the TC-190 magtape driver, and
last but not least the infamous Cafard (TOPS-20 equivalent of UUCP mail)
all used JSP coroutines.

No way to do coroutines in C.  The closest thing is setjmp()/longjump()
which is much less powerful.

The interesting thing was that I figured out coroutines on my own with the
Dialnet stuff 23+ years ago.  I remember telling the senior wizard about
my new neat hack, and was deflated to be told "it's an old technique
that's been around for years.  It's call a coroutine."  ;-)

I have no doubt that in about 10-20 years, some kidlet will rediscover the
idea and try to patent it.

There's no standard coroutine mechanism in C.  But if you can't
implement coroutines in a particular C implementation, that's the
implementation's fault, not the language's.  There's nothing in C
itself to prevent you from inventing your own generalized catch/throw
or transfer-control mechanism, which can be used to create
coroutines.  It's tricky to do that in a portable fashion, but wasn't
someone arguing just a little while ago that nothing significant
could be done portably in C anyway?

It's not *convenient* to do coroutines in C, true.  But then it isn't
in most HLLs.  (Scheme is one exception; no doubt there are others.)
Yes, that's unfortunate; coroutines are a useful technique.  But their
applications can be satisfied well enough by other techniques, so
there's no compelling reason to add them to established languages.

Personally, I'd like to see a new language with some elements of the
C philosophy but with more of the close-to-the-metal power of assembler.
The trend with C derivatives (C++, Java) has been toward more abstrac-
tion; that's desirable in many domains, but not everywhere.  (There was
an excellent interview with someone in DDJ a couple of years back about
numerical programming where the interviewee pointed out that the big
impediment to using Java for number-crunching wasn't its performance
but its abstraction, particularly its enforcement of rounding modes and
other chip-level behavior.)

Such a hypothetical language would allow the programmer to transfer
control to specific addresses, perhaps not only of functions but of,
say, basic blocks as well.  And it would have other niceties to ease
deviating from the simple call-and-return control flow, like a real
mechanism for handling parameters rather than  the clumsy stdarg
kluge.  (stdarg is handy, but it's nasty and opaque and situated at
the wrong level.  It should be built into the basic language, not the
standard library.)

There's Forth, which has many nice characteristics, but isn't well-
suited to most large production applications.  (Forth religious wars
follow up to alt.I.don't.give.a.damn, please.)  I'd like a procedural
language that can do this sort of thing.

Indeed.  I'm sure many of us remember the Mark Williams Company
"canonical network representation" patent (apparently still in force;
I looked it up on the IBM patent web site a few months back out of
curiosity), and things have only gotten worse since.  The latest DDJ
has an editorial ranting (appropriately) about the recent Amazon.com
patents on trivial ideas...

Daniel,

ITS was indeed very open: all users had what under UNIX would be
called root privileges (at all times).  Also, login did not require
any password, except when connecting from untrusted locations.

As mentioned above, there was a utility program that let you watch
what someone else was seeing on their terminal.  Mere voyerism was 
not the primary use of that facility, though; it was generally used 
to help some user who has having trouble.  It was also useful for
observing someone who was *making* trouble!  Just randomly surfing
around usually turned out rather boring.

There were certainly problems with malicous users, or more often,
users who were just making a mistake.  One poor fellow never lived
down the day he misunderstood a filename wildcard syntax and
accidently deleted almost all the files on the system!

We considered those kinds of problems to be worth the trouble,
compared to dealing with file security issues.  But that doesn't
work in the large.  A better analogy in today's world would be
a file directory in which the Group permissions were set so that
all group member could read/write/delete the files.

ITS was designed for use by a small number of cooperative users living
in a small laboratory.  It was a very advanced PDP-10 operating system
with many interesting features.  ITS was written at MIT (originally
for the PDP-6) and was not based on any other system.  

It was somewhat different from later PDP-10 operating systems such 
as TOPS-10 and TOPS-20.  Many people considered ITS to be better 
than TOPS-20, although "Twenex" had many features (security, batch
processing, extended addressing, uniform application command interface,
and more) which ITS lacked.  ITS was where EMACS, among other things,
was invented.

The ITS computers were run under a policy where we would allow some
limited access by guest users.  We called the guest users "tourists",
and they included students and researchers from MIT and elsewhere
on the network, and even some totally random people who somehow
figured out how to connect to us via the ARPANET.  However, I don't
recall the tourists being referred to in the derogatory manner 
described above, at least by us, even when they were being pests.

The ITS hackers (system programmers) jokingly referred to all the
other users as "lusers"; that didn't have anything to do with tourists.
This joke appears in various places all over the system.
See "LUSER" (or even "USER") in an authentic version of the JARGON file.

Some of the tourists were high school or college kids from the DC area
who had somehow gotten hold of a dialup number to the ARPANET.
Like, their daddy worked for the Defense Department, and they stole
it from him, and then they told a friend who told a friend.
Sometimes these tourists (knowing that at least to some degree,
they were not supposed to be on the system) would try to masquerade
as someone else; the smart ones just kept a low profile.
The DC/VA tourists were generally considered to be the most pesty
and most prone to do annoying things on the system, partly because
there were just more of them.  Anyway, when any particular tourist
became a problem, we would ask them to straighten up, or finally
go ahead and delete their account.  

Starting around late 1981, when people suddenly had access to personal
computers (like the TRS-80) and modems and BBS systems, there were many
more problems with tourist users.   Our open, unprotected environment
was not very compatible with the nascent real world.

Doing something like altering someone else's email would be a good
example of behaviour that would get you kicked off the system.  
That particular thing didn't happen very much -- I don't actually
remember any such incidents off the top of my head.  More likely
would be someone accidently deleting someone else's mailbox.

None of these guest users had any "right" to be on the system; the
whole deal was totally at the sufferage of the ITS administrators,
and so accounts could be terminated anytime for any arbitrary reason.
Typically, accounts were terminated for not obeying the rules about
when you were allowed to be connected (ie. not when the machine is
busy), harassing other users, or for doing things (eg. on the network)
that brought unwanted attention from the Government (you will recall
that the ARPANET was not a public network, but rather a military
network owned and opeated by the Department of Defense).

Not too surprisingly, many tourists had really weird and distorted ideas
about the system, the policies, the people on it, and the whole thing.

Even RMS once admitted to me that Tenex/TOPS-20 also had a better virtual
memory system than ITS.  In Tenex/TOPS-20, virtual memory was the
fundamental basis of the entire file/memory system.  The best way to think
of it is that every 512-word page, be it in memory ("core"), filesystem
("disk"), or swapping area ("drum"), had a globally unique page address;
and that a particular memory address space page could be mapped to any of
these.  A full understanding requires a reading of the PDP-10 Hardware
Reference Manual and understanding the function of the different types of
page pointers, section tables, page tables, shared page table, and core
status table.

In ITS, virtual memory was almost as much as an afterthought as it is on
UNIX.

Needless to say, TOPS-20 style virtual memory is probably unimplementable
on modern CPUs.

Heh heh.  However, I am not sure how pesty a tourist I was, since it
was only a little while before I accepted a research position at the
AI lab, where I worked on the development of ITS (and other things)
and was also the ARPANET liason and primary system administrator.

Yep, that was what happened when we started hiring all those lawyers.
I don't recall the patent attorney we hired, we got a lot of questions
about why we did not apply for patents on all kinds of things -
including the design for the original UART that Vince Bastiani, John
McNamara, Remi Lisee, et al did.  WE just wanted a lower price on

DEC was terribly sloppy about patenting the stuff they should
have.  Patent training was not widespread throughout the company.
Copyrighting was mainly because we, in Tape Prep, had been told
to put one in everything we typed up for the programmers.  If
it had been left to the programmers, not a thing would have
been copyrighted either because that info never made it through
the supervisor.

He and Bill Kilgore presented the results in the 10/20 conference rooms
(aka Hardware/Software C/Rs, off of the MR1-2 cafeteria) from 2-4PM on
Monday, 4-Mar-85.  The talk was catered (a red wine-flavored,
walnut-bit-encrusted cheese ball).

One presumes that Wild Bill worked on the port as well; I just don't
remember speaking to him about it, whereas I chatted with Peter a tad.

Peter (at least) might have paid for the cheese ball.  I don't know
whether the wine flavoring was port, or something else.

Now the truth can be told:  Once upon a time, FOROTS had to refer to a
secret bit in I/O buffer headers.

During backspace operations it would wait until I/O was done, and then
count the number of buffers that had been read, turning off use bits on
the way.  However, there was no documented way of telling how many
buffers contained data.  From FORIO.MAC:

"
FNDUSE:	MOVE	T4,-1(T3)		;GET STATUS WORD
	TLNE	T4,40			;TAPE EOF?
	 AOJA	T1,USEDON		;YES. WE'RE DONE
"

From S.MAC:

"
; I/O STATUS WORD ASSIGNMENTS - THESE ARE THE "MODE" OF DEVMOD

...
; STATUS BITS

;RIGHT HALF (USER)

...
; LEFT HALF (SYSTEM)

...

	XP	IOEND,40	;SERVICE ROUTINE HAS TRANSMITTED LAST DATA

"

The bit is commented as a "system" (non-"user") bit, but the
information was only available by testing that bit.  I remember the look
on Jon's face when he came back from the monitor group telling him to
use the magic number (maybe they even told him about the magic number in
the first place).


The reference eventually went away when FOROTS switched to leaning more
heavily on TAPOP.

No.  I don't.

IIRC, when FORTRAN-10 was begun (I was in Tape Prep so that
had to be 1971 or 1972), Norma was still a programmer becoming
project leader; so didn't that make Al Ryder the supervisor?
John Everett would remember more.  Ah, and I forgot, Valdeanne
Alusic was there at the time, too.

The divergence of BLISS-10 (and, I suspect also BLISS-11)
and BLISS-nn was due to two software ships from CMU that
were spanned by many years and implementing backwards
incompatibilities.  What do you expect from something 
produced via an insulated installation?

> ...and requirement for

There requirement that BLISS be used for everything came from CMU
imports.  I remember the day when I was told that all TOPS10
monitor _patches_ had to be written in BLISS.  Now, patches
are little tiny files written in DDT that were applied to EXE
files.  And these HARDWARE assholes couldn't understand that
the law didn't make any sense.

Errrmmm, no.  This also happened when JMF got lobotomized from
a 36-bit to a 32-bit memory.  He was doing the Alpha CPU
stuff _for_ VMS and got told that from the VMS language people.

Yes.  That is the way it should work.  But, as a group gets
successful, the number of people involved increase.  Eventually,
the group splits up so that the workers can "managed" better.
Then egoes and empire building happens.  Soon, the groups
no longer tolerated a "good morning" from each other.

Nah, this happened before there was inefficiency.  What happened
is we got a fatal infection; I always called it CMUitis.

Not with an edict that demanded all programming be done in BLISS.
The only holdouts that I know of was the -10 people.  (There may
have been little pockets of PDP-11 resistance, like IAS.)  And
we had to get "approval" for each and every module that we had
to write in MACRO-10.

Read above. :-).  There's more the story but it was 
all a complicated political mess.

OH, yes...I remember.  The Jupiter was supposed to cause that
flavor of programming.  I was in FORTRAN maintenance at the
time, attending the FORTRAN devlopement of verion 6 reviews
of specs and project meetings for the minions.  The OTS guy
was starting to program for the way it was _rumored_ that
Jupiter executed instructions.  That was one issue that
I put my foot down and insisted that nothing be done based
on Jupiter architecture.  I won that battle, fortunately.

I know.  It was an old fight.  There was nothing that pissed
us (TOPS10 group) off more than those other groups telling
us what work we should do.  They usually had a ton of manhours
available to spend and we only had three people to do all
the work in the monitor and most of the CUSPs.  In order to
get a complete development effort done, I generally picked
up all the shit work and did it on my own time.

I've been meaning to get back to this for a week and a half.

In the following directory listings, the fields are

 filename.type.gen	size bytecount(bytesize) date-and-time-of-write

where _size_ is in Tops-20 disk pages (512 words, often with 5 7-bit ASCII
characters/word).  The header is the structure ("filesystem") and directory.

First, the Tops-20 monitor:

FUDGE2 is probably on the Customer Supported Tape (I tried
to put everything there for the customers especially 
after I knew we were going to get axed).  I have no
idea how we got FUDGE since that was there when I met
my first PDP-10.  I suspect that one or two people
could have gone to work for IBM after exposure to DEC :-).

A lot of software wasn't written in house.  Note that
the CUSP tape _originally_ was a distribution of stuff
that was useful in-house and NOT deemed to be part
of the system support.  That was way before the so-called
Category A, B, and C support was created.

That explains the TU10 design and the TM10...  DEC didn't do tapes right
until the TE16/TM03 and they blew it again on the Tape Stretcher 11.
The response of any field service guy going out on a TS-11 call
was Tough S**t.  They finally fixed it up in an ECO about the time they
stopped making the drives and shipped the TU80's and TS[V]05's.

DEC Field Service school note:

When they designed the TU10 they placed the heads directly in the middle
of two guide rollers.  Where's the most vibration and jitter in the path
of the tape -- right there.

The TU10 designers took the folks from the RK05 and asked them to do
a tape drive... Nothing like a tape drive designed by disk folks.

The finally fixed in in the TE10/TE16 -- DEC's best non-DECtape drive
reliable, solid... but slow.

Sigh!  You have so much to learn and I'm not sure how I can
teach you everything that's in my head.  Every once in a while
I wish I could do a brain-to-brain dump and this is one of them.

Let me try.  I don't want to detract you from programming while
I talk about our folklore.  

There isn't a "default" per se in a monitor build.  We used 
feature test switches to turn particular pieces of code on or
off.  If the feature test switch KS10 was turned on, then
all code enclosed in a ...blitz...my brain just went south...
Sorry, I can't remember the ASCII lines in the *.MAC files.

Does somebody remember how these were written and worked?

Well, as somebody who also worked in the maintenance group, 
customers could be a PITA w.r.t. support.

Yup.  And remember to read the comments in those sources.  It's
how we documented just about everything one needed to know
about the hardware foibles.  This is true especially in
TW's case; he never remembered what he did yesterday and
had to keep comments to remind.  JMF, on the other hand,
could remember everything, including every line of code
that he wrote.  So his commenting style was quite different.

After working on writing a new device driver or something,
TW had a TECO macro that would open up the sources that he
wrote, display the next uncommented line, and wait for
insertion.  That was how TW always finished up a project.
There should still be quite a few lines that say "beats
the shit outa me" for the instructions where he couldn't
remember why it was needed.  TW always needed a long
incantation breathed at him before he could remember stuff.
Jim was adept at figuring out the shortest incantations to
get TW to remember.

About the same number as the Univac 1108, and the IBM 704, 709, and
7090 which all preceded the 7094. Since we're in the PDP-10 newsgroup,
I assume that he was talking about the anniversary of 36-bit machines
from Digital Equipment Corporation. The first of which would be the
PDP-6, I believe.

Geezer time!  Well, I don't know about Forth, but speaking of
random access, we had a Macro program that did the same thing:
let you use a 9-track as if it were a DECtape.

I always thought DECtapes were pretty neat.  If DEC-20s had
supported DECtapes (and if there had been a way to put remote
DECtape drives in public areas) there probably would never

a way for students to have removeable media to save their
DEC-20 class files at the end of each semester before we wiped
the RP06's.

You seem to forget that he also wrote SORT-10 when he got
bored with LINK-10 :-)  I convinced him that MACRO-11
style local labels were neat so he wrote procedure and local
label macros for SORT-10.  They were fun :-)

Definitely a guy who likes self-inflicted pain ;-).  Pete
Conklin wrote those last two.  It caused JMF to declare that
no managers should ever be allowed to write code after
promotion.  The problems were that PFC didn't have time
to do all that follow-up work (like debugging, fixes,
and _documentation_) because he got side-tracked by 
his day job.

Nah, I didn't forget that.  We (JMF and I) would have lunch

ROTFLMAO!  You're dating yourself.  I remember that happening
once, too.  Soon after that the system got upgraded to Level
D and all those problems went away.

I bet you youngsters didn't know that once upon a time, the
operator on the console could login to [1,1].  I even worked
on that area when I had to enter 2000 PPNs and make up passwords
for each of them.

There was a reason that TW's nickname for him was Doug
Destroy.  

My apologies for not catching that sin.  If any of us had,
we would have written an MCO to put it right.  Remember the
time that Don Lewine put his initials in all of the sources,

On the -10, the 1775 entry vector directory entry was only written by
LINK for extended addressing programs (and LINK-10 V6 introduced its
extended addressing on the -10).  On the -20, entry vectors could be
created by LINK when loading directly to core for both section 0 and

When Gordon Bell, Alan Kotok, Tom Hastings and R. Hill wrote their
article _The Evolution of the DECsystem 10_ (p. 44-63) for the Jan-78
Computer Architecture issue of CACM (V21, #1), the word went out to
supply Gordon with FORTRAN-10's coverage of the instruction set.

An attempt was made.  However,  most of the instructions are generated
by adding mode bits maintained in tree nodes:

	%(*****TO COMPUTE THE VAL OF AN ARITHMETIC NODE.
		DEPENDS ON THE VALS A2IMMEDFLG,MEMCMPFLG,VALTYPE, AND OPERSP OF THE PARENT ...
	********)%
MACRO	ARITHOPIX(PNODE)=
	BEGIN
		(.PNODE[A2IMMEMCMPFLGS]^4+.PNODE[OPRSP2]^2+.PNODE[VALTP1]+... OPGARI ...)
	END$;

to instruction patterns:

OPGARI:	-1,,ADFX
	-1,,ADFL
	-1,,ADDPKI
	-2,,ADCM
...
	ADFX=.			;ADD INTEGER
	FRRFC,,FROMA2
	ADD	0,0
;
	ADFL=.			;ADD FLOATING PT
	ADCM=.			;ADD COMPLEX (next 2 instrs)
	FRRFC,,FROMA2
	FADR	0,0
;
	FRRFC,,FROMA2
	FADR	1,1
...
	ADDPKI=.		; add double-prec
	ADDPMI=.		; (to memory - next 2 instrs)
	FRRFC,,FROMA2
	DFAD	0,0

However, the correct answer is not trivial to derive.

Perhaps more than 10 years ago, William Wulf wrote a good article on
the thesis that instruction sets with regularity make it easier for
compilers to generate good code.  It backs up the point with a litany of
stupid quirks in instruction sets which just make things harder.

The philosophy of RISC architectures are to make code fast at compile
time, rather than investing in a lot of circuit complexity to make
implausible operations fast at run time.

    If I recall, it was the "Frankenstein" (my nickname, not DEC's) machine,
built
from the remains of several KA-10's.  System 26, as I recall, not to be
confused
with the KL 1026.

    It was about the most reliable machine in Marlboro at the time, IIRC.
It did
eventually get moved to Bedford, with the rest of the Ed Services machines.

    Damn, that was a fun machine to play with.  And it could actually
support a
respectible number of users at one time.  And I also seem to recall that
they
used it for the TOPS-10 Monitor Internals Class for a while.

DEC in the OLD day of the PDP-10 (KA-10) had a device call a RD-10
1 platter disk drive fixed heads about 5 or 6 ft across, and a
good size hole in the center for the hub assy.

They make Nice coffee Tables and the center hole... Find a nice
flower pot that will fit in it.

Could you be refering to Bryant disk drives???  My understanding is that
the Bryant drive had one huge platter in the range of 1.25 meters across.
This platter spun verically instead of horizontally, and it did spin 
fairly fast.  I have heard stories of these platters getting loose and
cutting through walls, etc.  IMHO this is *not* an urban legend...

Bryant was one maker, I think Control Data also made a huge plattered
disk.

By the time the story about the loose platter had got to me, it was
devoid of sufficient specifics (where, how it came lose, when, etc)
that it seemed prudent to consider the possiblility that it was
legend.  If you have a more complete version of the story, I would
love to hear it.

We had two CDC 6603 disk units at Arizona, with 1-meter platters on a
horizontal axis.  They were sometimes called "the Bryant disks", and
I always assumed that CDC had just relabeled them.

We never had a platter go spinning away, just head crashes and one
impressive loss of hydraulic fluid.

Nope.  They weren't.  And because of this fact, our Release Engineering
people _always_ made their masters on "short tapes".  The way they
did it was to pull many, many feet of tape off the tape that was
doomed to be a master and attach a new silver BOT.

That's one of the computing laws of Murphy.  It's guaranteed that
the one tape you pick for a master will be the longest tape
in the building.

<snip>

Why a TU10?  That would guarantee an inability to read.  We
had a TU71 (TU70 7-track) that we had to have just because
we had customer who owned tapes that were written on 7-track
drives, may own a 7-track drive, or might own 7-track drives.
It was one of the distasteful side effects of backwards
compatibility support.  Having this drive on our system (it
was the only 7-track in DEC) was a part of the downsizing of
OSes.  One of the distribution options of our software was
7- or 9- track magtapes.

I think I saw more MUL's and DIVs used in pairs to multiply an integer
by a ratio.  If you wanted to compute X*(N/D), you'd multiply X by N and
then divide the result by D.  Some combinations of X and N could never
overflow a word, but some could.  When overflow could never happen,
you'd see:

	IMUL	X,N
	IDIV	X,D	; (Remainder in X+1)

When overflow could happen in the intermediate result, but not in the
final value, you'd see:

	MUL	X,N
	DIV	X,D	; (Remainder in X+1)

Sometime between fall '77 and spring '81, there was a run of edits like

It was called SMP.  That allowed field service to remove the
pieces of hardware that was on the PM schedule WITHOUT a 
reload...something TOPS-20 couldn't do.

After all this time, you still have no idea how our business
was run.  There wasn't anybody who had time to do that;
the internal politics wouldn't allow _one_ poor slob to
fix everything; and, at that time, just because we had
a fix for everything, didn't mean it got out to the
field in bits.

Well, things got better after we only had one version of them
in the field.  When I was "trained", there were at least a dozen
of SCANs and WILDs and COMPIL and DDT were under the control
of the language group whose management really wasn't interested
in messing with the itty-bitty pieces that were classified as
Category B support.

Right.  I missed that :-).  I doubt that I ever opened 
COMPIL (other than to do that blasted copyright mess).  Did
it retain the old style of AC naming convention?

Well, that was one good thing that came out of Conklin's 
SCAN and WILD (at least I think that's when it started).
About the same time, a memo came out dictating what and
how ACs got labelled.  John?  Do you remember how that
all got started?  I don't remember when Conklin did
the code.  I just remember JMF mumbling that managers
shouldn't be midnight hackers when the bugs never got
fixed.  And that was in 1975 or '76 when we were in
Marlboro.

AC name rationalization came along very early in the Level-D (5 Series) 
monitor. I don't recall whether the new universal AC names were defined in Tom 
Hastings' spec LEVELD.MEM or not. As I recall (dimly) Don Black actually 
edited in the AC name changes in every module.

SCAN and WILD, being outside the purview of the monitor group (at least at 
their inception) got whatever AC names PFC thought appropriate at the time.

BTW, how many remember SCANNER? I believe this was either a predecessor of 
SCAN, or a mutation. At the time I did the mods to DAEMON to support VM, it 
still was linked with SCANNER, although at that time SCAN and WILD were in 
more common use. I didn't have the time/guts to try to replace SCANNER with 
SCAN at that time. And yes, I know SCANNER is a seven character name, but I 
can't recall if it was actually called SCANER, or SCANNR, or SCNNER.

You might have a difficult time with that.  The ethernet was
implemented via DECnet and we (TOPS-10 monitor group) had to
fight tooth and nail to ship the monitor sources of our
ethernet implementation.  We didn't even try to publish
spec information other than user mode stuff.  We lost the
battle of shipping the BLISS-36 code.  One of Palmer's 
"convert everything to cash" actions was to sell the DECnet
part to another company.  I have no idea what the status
of existing DECnet code is.

Oh, no.  You don't want to go there.  That's the fxxxxx MCB.
Our MCB approach made the committee who designed a horse look
smart.  The MCB was yet another -11 and all of those binaries
are output from the <gag, barf> BLISS-36.  Stick with the
ethernet stuff and Phase IV of DECnet if you think you need
to that.  The MCB was stopped at Phase III and it sucked.

Sorry, Stu.  It wasn't your fault you got handed a lemon for
specs.

Huh?  What's a snipts?  No, Stu did a lot of the MCB work
for the 7.03 ship (I think it was 7.03..may have been 7.02).  
The MCB was foisted upon us (TOPS-10) and it was a RPITA to
certify _and_ to package.  I've always had the notion that,
if it's difficult to package, the soft/hardware design is 
not elegant.  So far, I haven't encountered anything that
contradicts my opinion.

That was code derived initially as a customer special (Abbott Labs) that
got migrated into the release stream.  I took care of it from 1976-1978
or so, I'm the wrong one to ask about what it did in 7.0x releases.
It postdated ARPAnet (but the developers ignored those protocols), it
predated DECnet (except for DDCMP), so most of it doesn't match anything
at all.  When I left, it supported DL10 and DTE20 interfaces between
-10 and -11.  The -11 code supported terminals and printers.

It was required code for KL10s if you wanted anyone to use the machine
other than the console.  (Or whenever it was that DC10 support got
dropped.)  That made it the first network product that DEC shipped that
was necessary to use the system as it was meant to be used.

I implemented the DECnet compatible frob, err port, but had completely
forgotten about it years later when I went on a business trip for a
different employer to visit people I had met on an earlier trip for
DEC.  I think my successors added code to it and may have made it useful.

Um, (Barb - help!)  I think either the DL10 (which the DC76 used for
the 10-11 interface) either stopped being produced or one of the
models shipped with internal memory or no original I/O bus.
Or maybe I argued that a system with a DC76 was a computer network
itself.

Oh dear - memory getting too fuzzy!

DAEMON ran detached.  There was no use of a command scanner.
When a program shipped a request to DAEMON, part of the
argument list of that call was the index into that table
so a similar table.  I still would like to have my original
question answered.  Somewhere along the way, DAEMON's 
functional spec was modified, either by intention or
by attrition.  My guess was the latter, but it would be
nice to know what the original intent was.

The edit history doesn't give me enough information because

And, IIRC, I shipped those executables on the Customer
Supported Tape.  Wasn't there another cross-assembler?  It
seems to me that MACY11 was a big company secret for quite
a while.  

If you want to see how ANF-10 was built, there should be
control files (we did nothing by hand for the benefit of
our customers).  Look for *.CTL

True, true. The code was tight, because it had to run without
much memory and in real time. It was the kind of hand-crafted
assembler code that C-fanatics always claim could be better
done in a higher-level language, but which never seems to
actually work when done that way.

Yes. You're exactly right -- my fingers slipped. TOPS-10. It would
also assemble on TOPS-20, though.

Well, it was SUPPOSED to be a big secret. Actually, MACDLX
was the cross-assembler since something like 1972, (it didn't support
some kinds of relocation that MACY11 did). MACY11 wasn't much
of a secret, though. The MACDLX documentation actually mentioned
MACY11 long before it was supposed to be talked about to customers,
and since some customers actually read the documentation, they wanted
the better cross-assembler. Only DEC management thought it was a secret.

Well, it will depend very much on the year (and version) of the
code he has. If the code was pre-DN8x, then there may not be
control files (remember the years of beating up on DAS to try
to get them to do things in anything like a standard way?).

None of us were real PDP-11 programmers, so the code looks
a lot like PDP-10 code with operand order switched around.
It probably gave PDP-11 jocks the shivers just to read it. But
it ran like the very blazes, and was far far more reliable than
standard DECNET. Did more, too, and was far far easier
to debug. It maintained all sorts of status tables just in case
there was a crash, something that -11-land DECNET devices
never did.

There was a hacked-up version of DDT (DDT11) and
you could read and write the remote station's memory
(and modify the -11 code on the fly if you dared).

I recollect that the code at one point had dozens and dozens
of feature test switches to make a DN80 or DN81, or DN82,
or DN87, or whatever. At one point or another we rewrote all
that so that there were macros which turned on and off the
various features, and which also assigned remote device numbers
(previously done by hand, which was both stupid and a real
pain).

There were two of them.  MACDLX was the first and was a .MAC->.BIN
assembler.  That was what was officially available for the first -11 front
ends and remotes.  Then there was MACY11/LINK[XY]11 (wasn't there a MACX11
first?) which was a real relocating assembler/linker.  I didn't do any -11
stuff while I was in Marlboro (74-75), and I knew about MACY11 by at least
1978, IIRC.

I gather the DN8x stuff was MACY11 with CTL files?  I was working kind of
pre-DN8x (I think what we had got that name later, but we didn't start with
it - though I don't remember what name we ordered).  I used only MACDLX.
(We had a DL-10 with 1 11/40 front end.  I did LSI-11 remotes supporting
printers and terminals and DOS/VS RJE to our -10 with an 11/23 :-)

Indeed, the earliest version of the MACDLX documentation that
I have says:

 MACDLX.DOC -- Documentation for MACDLX V622
 December 1972



 1.0  FUNCTION OF MACDLX

 MACDLX is a powerful MACRO assembler which runs  on  DECsystem-10  and
 generates  code  for  the  PDP-11.   MACDLX should be used to generate
 binary files for the DC75 and DC44.  MACDLX is  a  subset  of  MACY11.
 MACY11  is  a  software  product  of Digital Equipment Corp.  The only
 features in MACY11 not found in  MACDLX  are  those  which  deal  with
 relocatable code.

Those who are interested can find MACDLX.DOC and MACDLX.MAN at

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/

on the tape BB-X128B-SB, the CUSP BIN AND SRC tape.  For some
strange reason, MACDLX.DOC doesn't appear on BB-X128C-SB, the
next higher rev level of this tape...

Aw, geez, Tim.  Give me the years.  Even after revamping how
we did the BOMs, I couldn't remember those awful names.

There was some point where I got an edict from some idiot 
product manager that I couldn't delete the useless DOC
files from the CUSP tape.  There was also another time
where DOC files were actually MAN files in sheep's
clothing.

Agree. It really depends on the compiler and the machine. As you

When the programs become sufficiently long, then a clever compiler
beats hand-coded assembly because it can keep track of more
states and worry about things like instruction pre-fetch and what's
in the cache over hundreds of instructions.

I had somewhat the opposite experience with the -11 code.
Your code was an exception, and perhaps not the general rule.
Certainly my -11 code wasn't up to the quality of yours.
Later I did more -11 programming and actually got a feel for it.

Was it? It's possible. I don't remember that attribution. Certainly
the /FE:n switch and the /LINE:n switches were added at DEC.

Hell, Barb, I can still tell you how the device macros in the ANF code built the control
blocks for the DH and DZ11s, or what the buffering structure for DDCMP was (and the tricks
we used to make it so fast compared to DECnet.)

Those device macros were recursive, calling itself up to 16 times, depending on how many
devices you were supporting.  Real ugly, but the concept was pure Dave McClure.  He did it
for just the DH, originally.  I had to make it work for the DH or the DZ or both.  (We
actually had two customers who ran DN87's with mixed DH's and DZ's.)

Here is a BIG hint.....

Until last month, I worked with John Purretta.  Bet that's a name from your past.
Another hint:  I worked in Taylor Street, about 100 feet from Jim.

I really liked the VR4.

Me.

I don't know about PIP, but the monitor's copyrights were back
dated when the EXE copyright mess landed on our heads.  
Believe me, you cannot use the copyright dates as
an indicator of _when_ things happened to the code.  I did this shit.
You know?  TE FOO.MAC
		NCOPY$0TT$$ <now insert appropriate year>

I typed those commands.  I even, in my Tape Prep days, had
the ASCII template file that went into everything that we
created, modified, or processed.  Jeez.  Listen to your

Didn't the EXE spec start happening before Jim wrote VMSER?  I
seem to remember wrestling with all those extensions when
the monitor group was still on 5-5 and I was in the Computer
Operations group.

Huh?

By the way, did anybody, who is reading this thread, ever use
the DUMP command?  I never did.  I don't know anybody who
did other than MPB BATCON burping.  CDO?  You can tell me this.

Ah...  Yep, it wasn't "BATCON", it was "BATCH".  1970 batch support
consisted of BATCH, STACK and DRIVER.

Then what couldn't be a user?

Users linked DRIVER into applications that might need a postmortem
core dump, particularly when run in a batch job.

I don't think they did in those days.  An installation might,
but not a user.

I don't remember how BATCH worked.  I don't believe
that there were PTYs in those days.  It's clear that
the DUMP command was there for the IBMers who couldn't
make the conversion to timesharing.

I didn't do monitor programming.  Never believe the comments.
I'm not really sure what that code is doing.  From the way
I read it, the EXE bit is getting set in JOBSTS.  That doesn't
imply that the core image is getting saved in the old save format.

4.3 IMPLEMENTATION OF DRIVER

The $EXLDR card automatically loads Driver into core before any user
program(1).  ...
...
(1) If the $EXLDR card is omitted, Driver can be loaded with a $LDR card
or a $RUN SYS LOADER card.

"
2.1 DESCRIPTION
...
When Batch is being run from a user's console Teletype (TTY) as a
time-shared job, with a job number n, it sequentially initializes and
executes a series of time-shared jobs (with job numbers m1, m2, etc.)
in parallel with itself.  Batch accomplishes this by utilizing a
"simulated Teletype" (called a pseudo-Teletype (PTY)).  A PTY is a
mechanism by which one job (a control job) can control another job (an
object job).  Batch uses a PTY to type its commands to the object job.

Don't blame it on me :-)  A lot came from Phil Budne (thanks again!).  Plus
netknowledge :-)

Thanks to all the previous posts.  I've incorporated those.  Plus I saw an

Ummm, some might disagree :-)  Some of us called it TOPS-5 at the time :-)
It was only half of TOPS-10, not twice :-)  But of course we were a bit
prejudiced :-)  And it was young - this was at the time the name changed

I didn't because I don't remember ever typing in their code.
I do remember Gross haunting 5-5, but I don't remember him 
in the 3-5 area.  

Alan was one of the people that the trainers (Magee, Sheila,
and Nadine) in Tape Prep would point to, say his name in 
awe, and declare him to be a really smart guy :-).  Dave 
Gross didn't get the same treatment.

FORHST.MAC, the revision history file started on 12-Mar-79 for
FOROTS V6 (and then left fallow until 20-Mar-80).

With years of development taking place after that, and a closeout
summary meeting (maybe not the last) taking place at Fall DECUS '90.
The last development edit for Fortran V11 (which finally delivered full
Fortran-77) was MEM's 4561 of 13-Jan-87.  The last maintenance edit was
DCE's 4606 of 12-Jan-89.

This is edit 1507 of 4-Jun-81:

"
1507	BAH	4-Jun-81
	Fix up FORRTF, TOPS10 real time library routine, to work with version 6
	memory management.
"

Changes to FUNCT., ALCOR. and/or DECOR. calls, I guess.

OK, here's another small note of development style in PDP-10 land.

You say "lie fallow".  Now, that might have been true for 
FOROTS.  However, it certainly was the case that, if a massive
development effort was going on in a particular piece of 
software, none of the day-to-day programming changes were
ever documented or assigned an edit number.  In the case of
edit number assignations, that was pretty much left up to
the developer to decide when that number should be bumped up.
It usually was done when a test bed of the software was
put up on NEW: on the TOPS-10 development system.  Eventually
that set would be put on SYS: to ensure that the software was
the only one used (not everybody had /NEW set in their 
search list.   Oh, yeah, another caveat:  I'm only talking
about the programming habits on the TOPS-10 side.  I have
no idea (or not much, anyway) of the programming habits on
the TOPS-20 side unless they impacted the -10 in some way.

There is development and then there is doing the necessary
work so that the whole package can be put on the shelf and
forgotten.  When the cancellation of Jupiter happened, the
developement and maintenance groups merged (they were no
longer under two different VP organizations) and our sole

Hmmm... I'll have to think about that one and test my memory
recall to see if I can remember it :-).  It'll be a nice
exercise for me.  I thought we had dropped real time support
with V7.01.

That one-year gap probably means that even the developers thought they

You had it easy on the -10 development systems.  Possibly a draft:

PS:<LATEST-AND-GREATEST>, PS:<FIELD-TEST>, PS:<AUTOPATCH-TEST>,
PS:<NEW-SUBSYS>, PS:<SUBSYS>, PS:<OLD-SUBSYS>, PS:<NEW-UNSUPPORTED>,

Many man-years of already-planned new development were done on
Fortran-10/20 after Jupiter's cancellation.  Doubtless VMS compatibility
features were moved up in the schedule and other things were cancelled
because of Jupiter, though.

It was decided before 19-May-82 to transfer TSG's maintenance functions
to engineering.  KO didn't announce the cancellation of Jupiter to MR
until 17-May-83, almost a year later.

I still like the original code name for the KC10 - Hepahastus.
Yep, equiv of Vulcan, husband of venus, and in one story, ate the
children of Venus.  That was why I proposed the name.

If this is a copy with about two cisco email messages in it from circa 1988,
then it probably came from me originally (at least I've got a 1994
timestamped copy with that corruption, and I don't believe that I downloaded
it.)  I'm not quite sure how it got to the download site - probably from
cisco's 20s to XKL's 20s or somesuch...

>He was before my time :-).

For all of you "late comers" who never heard of "some guy named Don Witcraft", 
let me elucidate. Don was practically a "founding father", having worked on 
the PDP-6 monitor before the PDP-10 was built.

How many here remember working on the -6 before the monitor was capable of 
swapping? Remember shuffling? Remember "gentleman's timesharing"? Remember 
yelling, "can anyone 'CORE 0' so I can run an assembly"? Donald A. Witcraft 
(DAW) designed and implemented swapping in late 1966.

When I joined DEC in September 1966 I was assigned a desk in an office I 
shared with Don Witcraft, Maury Fredriksen, and Tony Wachs. Don was an evening 
person. While the swapping monitor was being debugged/tested, we ran the 
shuffler in the morning, and after Don arrived (about noon), the swapper in 
the afternoon. At first, because of the crash rate people stayed away in 
droves. Don persevered, and eventually swapping became something we all just 
took for granted.

After getting swapping fully implemented and debugged, Don looked for another 
challenge. Gordon Bell (at CMU during this period) and Adrian Van Der Goor 
(one of Gordon's grad students) proposed a hardware mod to allow timesharing 
on the PDP-8. DEC decided to give it a try, and Don and I were the monitor 
development team. Don did the scheduler, UUO handler, and the command decoder. 
I did the disk support and file system, the TTY scanner (680i), and the 
character routing code. The result was TSS-8, what we believed was the first 
commercial minicomputer timesharing system.

Don left DEC soon after TSS-8 was deemed releasable for a firm on the west 
coast. I lost track of him years ago. I've often wondered what became of him.

Nothing to do with maintainer's initials, but this reminds me of a running 
debate I had with TW and JMF over the viability of shuffling. I wanted to try 
an experiment where shuffling was removed from the KA monitor. I proposed that 
all memory management be done via swapping. I thought we were wasting an awful 
lot of processor time doing big BLTs in exec mode. I proposed expanding BIGHOL 
by swapping adjacent jobs in order to fit in a runnable, but disk resident 
job. I recognized that the DC-10 was going to steal memory cycles to 
accomplish the task, but thought it might just be worth it.

Although we discussed this sporadically over the years, I was never able to 
convince anyone to allocate the resources to just give it a try and see what 
the results would be. I think a lot of it was because as time went by the KA 
became less and less important, and my proposal was perceived more and more as 
an intellectual exercise.

If BLKC had been preserved it would have still been in bits.
LEVELD.MEM was also in the functional spec part of the Software
Notebooks (but I can't remember is some "enterprising" writer
deleted it as they did some of the other specs.  I had saved
every spec that had been deleted from the Notebooks and all
of those resided in a box in my office marked "Old Documentation".
The box is another item that seems to have disappeared after I
got sick and couldn't guard it anymore.

SOUPing anything was a bitch if the commentary heard over
the walls was any indicator :-).

The fingers that are typing this post are the ones that split
up COMMON.MAC when it got too large for even the halest of
men to tote from the bookcase to a desk.  I started the edit
during the morning shift.  I was replaced by, I think, Nadine
the next shift.  They monitor guys asked me if I could stay
and finish the edit.  I agreed as long as they could give me
a ride home (I had no car at that time).  At 22:00, Alan 
Frantz decided he wanted to go home and I was only 2/3 of the
way through the edit.  One of the monitor guys (I hope it was
Tom Hastings) finished the edit.

Now, I was not a slow editor.  However, Tom Hastings did the markup.
And dear Tom marked the macro expansions, not the actual code.
So no N-search would find the damn page that the mark was on.
Tom was one of my least favorite people that night.

    Unfortunately, he's squandered most of that in reinventing the wheel.
    He's still fighting the wars of the 1970s.  He's still reimplementing
    1970s software: EMACS, UNIX utilities, etc.

    But there's limits to reimplementing.  That's why there is no GNU Windows
    (much less GNU NT), GNU Office, GNU Quicken, etc.  It's beyond their
    capabilities.  There isn't even a GNU MacOS, so they can't even make it
    into the mid-1980s of software technology.

It's more than that, and less.  GNU, Linux, and and awful lot of the open
source stuff is based on the belief that a single brilliant programmer CAN
write "the killer app or os", which would then be modified and tweaked by
relatively small numbers of hackers until it was the very image of
perfection.

I'm afraid that Those Days Are Gone.  Your basic unix kernel and tool set
may be forever the largest example of what can be done with that sort of
workforce.  Todays apps take large teams of engineers to put together.
Hell, todays apps take large teams of engineers just to keep running as the
world changes around them.

I'm constantly amazed as I read alt.sys.pdp10 just how FEW people worked on
the software at DEC, compared to a "modern" SW development company like
cisco (for instance.)  We probably have more engineers quit in any given
year than EVER worked on tops20, and I think we're pretty tiny compared to
microsoft.  Sadly (?), those brilliant programmers that were the stars of
the 70s and early 80s tend to be the ones that don't work very well in the
modern "team" environment (and likewise for the hackers who do the refining
steps that are supposed to come afterward.)

We're starting to see large products released as "open source" (ie
Netscape's Mozilla.)  It'll be interesting to see how that develops.

see http://research.microsoft.com/users/GBell/Bell_Smithsonian_Interview.htm
for a Gordon Bell interview from summer of 1995.  It covers this,
plus the rise and fall of DEC and lots more.

Yes, Bell's interview says that DEC's plan to eliminate all product lines
except for VAXes and low-end PDP-11 came from him, well after VAX
was introduced; it came to him during a Tahiti vacation.

Now all the 36-bitters from DEC know who to blame for the rape of the 36-bit
line.  Or maybe they already knew...I thought I detected some negativity from
that group when Gordon Bell was discussed.  Certainly I was disappointed in
Bell when I heard this...seems he stabbed a lot of 36-bit customers in the

I suggest that you do some more analyses.  The VAXes running
VMS never replaced the computer power of a TOPS-10 SMP system,
where "computer power" is measured by users' work that gets
accomplished per unit of time.

I don't consider it a coincidence that DEC started bleeding
in the red when the PDP-10 software line finished.

I can't speak to this specific incident (the abandonment of all lines 
except VAX and certain PDP-11s), but there was a discussion thread
in comp.os.vms awhile back with people assigning various groups 
(the IBM people who came in in the late 70's/early 80's, the Honeywell 
people, etc.  etc. etc.) for DEC's ultimate decline.

C'mon people, that's lazy thinking.  That's exactly the kind of
thinking that says that the neighborhood declined after <fill in
your favorite group here> moved in.  It's scapegoating and it's
easy and it's almost certainly wrong.

Remember, it was Ken Olsen who said that nobody would possibly
want a computer at home.  And now we see that it was Gordon Bell
who narrowed the product lines down to the point that DEC was 
inflexible to the point that they were unable to change when
the market and technology did.

Ken Olsen and Gordon Bell were hardly newcomers to DEC.  

Personally, I think what killed DEC was arrogance.  They had 
been so successful with the "DEC way of doing things" that they
simply could not adjust their thinking to a new marketplace.

Problem is, they really misidentified what the "DEC way of
doing things" actually was.  DECs success wasn't built on
increased focus, but rather with chaos, with Engineers
free to build the absolute best products without regard
for some broad strategic plan.

DEC became a company that felt that competition with itself
was a bad thing, when their success was built upon having
multiple overlapping product lines.  I'm concerned that 
Compaq also has this mindset that they won't compete with
themselves.  IIRC, a Compaq person even said as much at
a DECUS conference awhile back.

Right.  And for all kinds of reasons.  Footprint, power, 
support costs, initial purchase costs, and usage.

However, the PDP-10 line was beginning to move computing outside
of the computer room.  Just about every one of us had a terminal
and modem and called in to the computer daily..even though we
also moved our bodied into work.

It was a speech made by Bell that triggered all of the
middle management to, almost overnight, change the way
we did business.  And it was a speech where, if the 
sentence about having only one operating system had been
taken in context, those business decisions would have 
never been made.  Bell's sin was not stopping the madness.

You've got to be kidding.  It was the 36-bit _timesharing_
machines that took the computer work out of the lab.
No longer did one have to wait for a card job to get done.
Our implementations of timesharing gave users the impression
that they had the system all to themselves...just like you
now have with the PCs.  A good timesharing operating system
preserved that illusion with respect to all system resources.
People could make mistakes with their doors locked and produce
lots of programs to manipulate the data in the exact way
these users wanted it manipulated.  They didn't have to submit
purchase requests for a programmer.

That was the 80s, not the 70s; and by then, it was too late.  Also
note that software was not considered important to selling the
hardware.  Bell systematically played politics and removed any
high level management whose expertise was based on software rather
than hardware.  And this is where I blame Olsen...allowing Bell
to eliminate software knowledge at the VP level.

At the time he said it, those computers took too much
power and cost too much to maintain.  Remember, those
computers needed a person with specialized training to
to triage.  Also, board replacement was not the first
thing to do to solve a problem.  Software support was
even more complicated at that time.

You are right about the arrogance.  You are incorrect about
the adjustment part.  What happened is that we stopped
listening to our customers.  And that was caused by a
rapid decline of customer contact with the people who
did the real work.  Given a choice of sending the 
product line manager and somebody on JMF's or TW's
level to DECUS, the product line manager always went.

That's not quite right.  The way we produced a product for
the general customer population was based on hard/software
developed for one particular customer.  After all the lessons
were learned for the site-specific stuff, the good parts of
BOTH hardware and software were translated into the 
product lines.  This sort of development declined, too.

Yup.  They've inherited the folklore.  One of the problems
with overlapping product lines was that there was no metric
to evaluate profit and loss.  Most of the figuring was done
on a hardware revenue basis.  So all the minis that were sold
as a result of a PDP-10 installation was counted as a mini
revenue and subtracted from the -10 revenue.

What nobody seems to remember is that the guys (I think we
called them financial aides at the time) who did the accounting
were starting to make policy and development decisions.  And
some of these guys had never logged into a computer system in
their life.  They had no idea what business we were in.

Sadly, these early PDP-10 phonebooks were printed on very acidified
paper.  Mine is beginning to crumble at the binding.  Fortunately, I
have a set of 10 and 20 ring-binder manuals as well that used good
paper from my days in the 70's, bringing up machines fresh out of the
truck.

Time passes.  I'd hardly remember how to power them up now.  They were
really fun machines to use.  Someday UNIX will discover the COMND/TBLUK
jsys.

As a sidelight, XKL Systems recently made PDP-10 compatible machines.
That company is up Seattle way.  It was founded by Bozack & Lerner who
started Cisco.  I believe that Ralph Gorin, who wrote the DEC-20
assembly language book, works there.  I don't know what they are doing
now.

AFAIK, the MG20 works fine with TOPS-10, as did the MF20.  They're
actually nearly identical, with higher-capacity DRAM chips in the MG20,
but all the same control logic, ECC, etc.

The only problem with using the MA20, MB20, MF20, or MG20 with TOPS-10
is that it is not multi-ported memory, so it can't support multiple
CPUs or external (non-RH20) data channels.  Thus it was only suitable
for smaller DECsystem-10 configurations.

If DEC had designed a fast multiported semiconductor memory box with
some ports that would connect directly to the KL10 S-bus interface
(rather than the DMA20 KI memory bus adapter), they would have sold
a lot of them.  I imagine that the cancelled product Barb mentioned
must have been something like this.

You are ignoring the cost of doing the software.  The hardware
isn't any damn good unless there's an operating system that
can run on it.  There wasn't much funding going into the
software side; all the money was going into the Jupiter
hardware project (we considered it a black hole).  Instead
of continuing to throw funding down a black hole, the cancellation
caused funding to be redirected to developing software.
There wouldn't have been any DECnet funding, making a Jupiter
system moot since it wouldn't have been online anywhere (they
weren't going to allow ANF-10 to hang off of that precious
gear).

From Cerf and Navasky, The Experts Speak (Pantheon
Press, 1984): "There is no reason for any individual to have
a computer in their home.", Ken Olson, Convention of the
World Future Society in Boston, 1977.
Source: Quoted by David H. Ahl in a 1982 interview with the
authors of the book.

In 1977, a lot of things were not clear. Apple was founded,
and computers were toys. On the other hand, Olson should
have realized shortly afterward that he had erred. Mistakes
happen, the important thing is to keep reviewing data and
make corrections when it is obvious a mistake was
made.

I'd forgotten about TGHA; that was another PITA (it was written
in BLISS-10).  Also, the TGHA work was not under the control
of LCG but under the control of field service.  Thus, in order
to get that group to do anything one had to go to the level
of vice president if noone wanted to compromise.  The people
doing the work were rarely available (never did know why) for
setting down and wrangling out the problems.  It seemed as if
even the most simple technical problem had to involve third and
fourth level managers.

I don't know about a program for all -11's that'll do that (I would
guess that the drastically different architectural implementations
and timing differences would make it non-portable), but if you
have an old enough PDP-10 you'll find "Music System for the PDP-10:
Version 1, November 1969" online at

  http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/www/lib10/0011/index.html

The abstract is below:

  Corporation 

  Source Language: MACRO-10 Special Hardware Required:
  MK10 or transistor radio Other Software Required: Time-Sharing
  Monitor (DEC-10-MTC0) Keywords: Music 

  Abstract: This program is a complete music-compiling and playing
  system for the PDP-10. MUSIC is compiled under the timesharing
  system and played in the executive mode. An initial library, mostly
  Bach and Beatles, is supplied to which users are encouraged to submit
  additions. 

  DEC-20 Review Note: Designed to be an executive-mode program,
  which cannot be run on the "20." Not part of the "20" Library. 

  Documentation on magnetic media. 

  Media (Service Charge Code): Write-Up (AA), DECtape (HA),
  600' Magtape (MA), or order 10-LIB-1 

The comments in MCOMP.MAC, the "music compiler" say

As Barb has said the software lagged the design, probably rather a
good thing too.  I do not recall the impact, I know we were focussing
on Fortran first.

And I guess you don't understand that the software _has_
to lag the hardware design.  It not a good or bad thing;
it's just a fact of life.


>I do not recall the impact, I know we were focussing

I know the Fortran people were getting talked to but
that just a complete waste of time.  Until you get an
operating system working that the Fortran compiler and OTS
and run under, the language people might just as well
suck their thumbs.  Instead some were coding for a 
ficticious Jupiter during their rewrite of FOROTS.
This was a practice that I did manage to stop.

I think the question had to do with how the addresses were laid
out by the hardware.  But I'm still munching on that
explanation of 4-way associative cache so the probability
that I'm wrong is 98%.  I do know that the question had
nothing to do with user apps, which is what Fortran is
compared to an OS.

I had a 'midnight conversation' with one of the managers associated with that
project a few years later.  The Jupiter was definitely
 (1) Late and getting later
 (2) Showing no promise of having anything like acceptable performance.

At the time, at least one customer noted that as late is it was getting, the
Jupiter would have had to achieve 8x KL performance to be truly acceptable.
It had been hyped at 4x, and was showing signs that it would probably fall
below even 1.6x a KL.  Couple that with its architectural lack of SMP support,

and it's no wonder it got the axe.

Being at the Las Vegas DECUS in '83 just after the cancellation announcement
was definitely an interesting expercience, too.

Most of the re-write (80% of SCNSER) was done in 7.03, FWIW.

That's not strictly true, though.  It often lost timer ticks, since a lot of

activities masked out the highest-level interrupts.  We finally fixed it
(maybe for 7.04, maybe not until 7.05) by using the hardware registers that
tracked the timer and making sure to correct for the missed interrupts.

Ralph Gorin used to have a copy of the ADVENT map on the wall outside his
office at Stanford.  He would never tell me where he came by it.

(Somewhere in my files, I have an N^{th}--generation xerographic copy of this
map, with the rooms reduced to about 0.75in (1.9cm).  Had to fill in the teeny
tiny room names as I came to them. ;-)

I believe that files with the .DRW extension are SUDS output.  (SUDS is the
Stanford University Drawing System, which went to DEC in company with Dick
Helliwell when the Super-Foonly project left SAIL to become the KL10.)  I don't
know the internals of the file format.

   FWIW, we at the RCS/RI have a virtually pristine, full-sized copy
of that map both on paper and Mylar media.  I also have it as a .TIFF
graphic, but, as I'm unaware of any possible copyright problems, I'm
somewhat reluctant to "let it out".

   If anybody in a position of responsibility regarding the artifact
can give written permission to distribute the map, I'd be happy to put
it up on the WWW.  (OK, colour me paranoid.)

   Cheers.

Nope - it was about 300 miles to the east, at the University of Pennsylvania.
WHARTON-10 was the only machine we had on the ARPANET for a very long
time (eventually the CS department got a VAX-11/785 hooked up to the UDEL
IMP as well, and used it as a router to connect the rest of the department
to the Internet - prior to that, our machines were stuck with e-mail access
only via CSNET PhoneNet, but that's a different story....).  Wharton had
not only the only ARPANET access on campus, but as far as I know, the
only ARPANET access in the eastern part of Pennsylvania (and like I
said, we didn't even have our own IMP....).

What wasn't well known at the time was that any Joe Random off the
streets of Philadelphia could come in and *buy* time on WHARTON-10,
even though they made you promise that you wouldn't do anything on
the ARPANET, which was intended for research use only.  Of course,
there was no mechanized way of enforcing that....  That's how I
got an account on the machine - I was a UPenn student, but really
had nothing to do with Wharton.  It was expensive, though - I
bought an initial allocation of time of about $50, and ran through
it in about three days, just goofing around on the net....

IMPCOM was the name of the TOPS-10 ARPAnet program that set up a
telnet link.  After I left CMU in 1974 Harvard gave me an account on
HARV-10, but I didn't get up there too often.  I did spend a couple
nights with Ed Taft (who left Harvard for PARC before I left CMU for DEC)
helping Rutgers get TOPS-10 on the net.  Don't know anything about
Wharton, forgotten most of what I miniscule amount I knew about TCP/IP
on TOPS-10.

1985 is pretty late. 4.2BSD was out with good TCP/IP support.  At that
point I was using using it at Alliant Supercomputer.  While we had USENET,
we wouldn't be on the Internet for another five years or so.

Tell me about it. I hacked TOPS-10 6.03 so that I (and the other
consultants) could monitor a specific TTY, character for character.
Believe me, it taught me a lot that I still use when dealing with
streams of data that I can't rely on being in the same spot when
I go back to look at it again.

Plus, on top of that, I didn't want to add ANY latency to the TTY's
normal operation so that the user would ever know he/she was being
watched.

A small ring-buffer and the fact that any terminal I monitored was
1200 baud or slower, and I was on a 9600 baud VT fixed that.

We had a lot of hackers, me being one of the worst. It was a system
(originally KA10) with a PDP-8(DCA) front end that allowed over 100 students
online at once. I was a high-school student at the time. JACCT
priv'd programs (programs in [1,4} and named LOGIN, LOGOUT, INITIA, DAEMON,
MIC, and others) are FUN to play with especially at <333> or lower :)
I used to find a file in [1,4} that was <333> or lower, do an ENTER
on it to lower the protection to <000> and then do another ENTER to
rename it to "LOGIN.SAV". Since there was already a LOGIN.EXE, it would
be run first no matter what. Unless you did "R sys:login.sav", in
which case, whatever you had written into that file (like PIP!) 
was run as JACCT and had complete run of the entire system.

This was later changed into five KS10's with a DCA front-end and a
UNIBUS adapter in each KS10. Never quite the same. I was offered
a job when I quit high-school, and went to work on the KS10's ...
a LOT of fun!

For a while, (in high school) over the summer, they were switching the 
terminals back and forth. Without even looking at the output, or
being logged in, I could tell which system was which by hitting
^T. IIRC, it said "?Not a job", but the latency on the KA10/PDP-8
was SO much lower than the DCA/KS10 that I could tell which system
the terminal was connected to just by hitting ^T and waiting for
the carriage to move in the LA120. If it instantly responded, it
was the KA10, if there was a 100ms delay, it was the KS10.

There was something about the way in which the UNIBUS adapter in
the KS10 dealt with interrupts that kept it from generating the
interrupt right away. It waited for a certain amount of time (from
experience about 100ms), before flushing the buffer and spitting
all the characters into the monitor.

Of course, a PDP-8 front end on a KA10 is a quite different animal
and seemed to be able to deal with interrupts instantly over 100
RS-232 ports. Although, most of the ports were 300baud or less.

Anyway... I'm rambling...

Right.  The naming of anything to do with TOPS20 took a lot
of people a lot of time, mainly because they kept changing
their minds every few months.  I guess it was some form
of job security.

It was really a no brainer when it came time to do the Hephastus
cpu - KC10.  KO would not let us call it KO.  We actually

KC10 was K, meaning CPU, C meaning 100K ECL, and 10 meaning a PDP-10 
instruction set processor.  We figured KO, cause Ken was the sponsor,
and we figured we could sell that. Ken being the really and truly
humble person he is, absolutely said no. I did not always agree with
his decisions, but he does have a good sense of right and wrong.

Sorry for the delay in following up on this,
This comment makes sense to me - Bob Elkind had been moved from LCG
engineering to Vax Engineering to work for the vax crew on the
other end of Marlboro - 2080 was right by the helo pad overlooking 495,
the vax guys were on the same floor and were closer to the road that
crossed
495, can't recall the street names, too many years.

Hmm that rings a bell too, wasn't that really driven by the amount 
of realestate we had for the boards - 2020 was hex, if irc, while the
vaxen pushed the L series big mutha boards.  That harkins back to Ed 
DeCastro arguing back before DG that the boards could be bigger!

You have to remember that the KS10 was designed for ADP to run
TOPS10.  It is quite possible that an installation from scratch
was never done for the V4.0 release.  The KS that we had was
rarely used by the -20 monitor group so any work done on the
KS part of TOPS-20 probably started with a disk pack that 
was ready to run rather than a blank one.  Somehow a niggle
in my head is saying that a new KS system that was shipped
to a customer came with a disk that was ready made for 
running.  If that was the case, then the manufacturing guys
were the ones who built it.  And I can tell you from experience
that those guys were not methodical _at all_.  My last triumph
was getting the contents of the KLAD pack out of their hands.

One of the side effects of not shipping sources is that the
source tape will not match the general distribution tape.
That was true with the -20 ships until management finally
figured out that an engineer should be designing the build
and packaging procedures.  That was another accomplishment
of mine.  There was a gap after Alan Frantz left that 
non-engineer types did all the decision making for the
packaging on both the -10 and -20.

He's using version 4.  That _particular_ tape might not have
been as rigorously tested as the later releases.  We didn't start
testing our cold start procedures until I got on the scene...and
I think that was some flavor of 6.03.  Laurie Piper and I played
the Token Dummy because she was rewriting the installlation guide.
After that, Token Dummy-ism became a standard testing procedure
for the -10.  The -20 soon followed :-).

Once again, let me reiterate:

Boot from tape using MTBOOT and install from scratch works on a real KS10.

I have personally done it in every release of TOPS-20 that came out for
the KS10, and for a few which didn't.  We're talking about unmodified
MTBOOT.

The TOPS-20 release distributions were never lackadasical and slipshod the
way some TOPS-10 releases were.

TOPS-20 sources actually built the same binaries; although the first thing
that a customer who had sources did was to merge their changes from the
previous release.  It took me about 12-18 hours of hard editing.

TOPS-20 release 4 came out something like 5 years after TOPS-10 6.03,
although its beta test started in 1979.

I was thinking about this on the way in this morning.
I said to myself, "Self, why did ya Kent instead of Kotok?"
and then I said to myself, "Yep, sure should get Barb to come back
with something snappy."
Well, of course you are correct, I knew kent better than Kotok is the
real
reason, I could fish Kent into arguing with me, Kotok just called me
a minicomputer guy.  I liked both of them, just as long as I could
find some way to drive Rick Merrill crazy I was happy.

I consider you, along with Carl and Bill, the last generation
of the monitor group.  And that last release was no lame
release.  I view it as one of the most important releases
that allowed customers to continue to run their -10s into the
ground.  If we had remained at DECnet Phase III, those -10s 
would have been shut off much earlier.

The -20 isn't dead.  PDP-10s are still being sold.  There's just
hasn't been anybody to do the TOPS-10 work necessary to run
on the new hardware (at least, that's the news two years ago).

You're forgetting your history.  The PDP-10 came out before the PDP-11.
The PDP-10 used RAD50 in the MACRO assembler symbol table.
Six RAD50 characters fit into 32 bits, leaving 4 bits to specify
what sort of symbol it was: opcode, macro, nonrelocatable value,
relocatable value, external value, etc.

No, it wasn't.

Tim, I don't think you need that much.  Probably, a quick look at the
DZ driver for ANF is all you need.  It is a very small file. The DZ is
a simple, byte at a time device for both input and output, and it only
does 8 lines.  IIRC, it is a really stupid board.

p.s.  I wrote the ANF DZ driver, that's how I know how stupid the
device really is.

Jim created the "per process monitor free core" concept so we could stick
TW's DDBs up in there.  I think I coined the name "funny space" (or at least
I remember doing it, the gray cells aren't what they used to be).  I did
write the "get funny words" and friends memory management routines.  What a
pain they were.

We could follow the trail of little gray hairs when you guys
were trying to get it all right.  Did all of this happen
around the time of BCTel and Poor Sally?  

Somebody's been talking about transaction processing systems.
I started to post about the architectural spec that you
and JMF wrote but decided not to because I couldn't remember
anything about it except sitting at the bar trying to get
you guys to set up the damn system so that Poor Sally could

I don't remember that project.  I'll think about it.
Somewhere on that tape there has to be the read KASER module.

Sigh!  It wasn't ripped out.  The KA was one of the feature
test switches that we decided to unsupport along with a slew
of other stuff we had to support because of backwards 
compatibility restraints.  The thinking was to try and get
some control over really decommissioning old stuff because
there were a lot of things JMF and TW wanted to do but 
couldn't if we had to accommodate all the old gear and
software options.  

Feature test switches and accompanying code had become
a maze of twisty little passages.

>
>I wonder if there are 6.* sources sitting around someplace...

I don't remember the monitor version number that stopped
supporting KAs.  Just as a point of reference, we were still
building KA monitors when I was doing the USAGE accounting
project because I did my development on system #2 back in
a dark corner of MRO-1-2.  JMF and TW were doing SMP 
around the same time.  So we were building a 7.01 flavor
of monitor that ran on the KA.

The 7.01 monitor was the first one that "didn't support" ka-10's when
it was released.  I'm sure it could still be made to work by those
who really wanted to do it.

The KL10 service enhancement project had run into a lack of additional
space for microcode, and so some little used KA-10 instructions (UFA, DFN,
FADL, FSBL, FMPL, and FDVL) were taken out of the KL microcode to make
room for other things.  7.01 included a way to emulate these instructions
and that code was in KASER.MAC for 7.01.  Timothy might need to look at
the 6.03a KASER.MAC for actual KA-10 handling.

Was there a 7.00 monitor that was used internally but not released?  I
seem to remember TWINKY running something like that.  Maybe 7.00 worked on
the KA-10 more easily than 7.01.

7.01 was the last release that "supported" KI-10 smp, 7.01a was the last
release that "supported" the KL10 model A cpu.  I spent several months trying
to make 7.02 work on the model A but never seemed to be able to get past some
cache bugs.  Now I realize those may have been hardware bugs in the model A.
Anyhow in one of the last DECUS meetings where DEC allowed TOPS-10 developers 
to have face-to-face with customers I tried to get Jim Flemming to give me
some clues regarding making 7.02 to run on the A, and he was unusually poker 
faced about it the entire time.....Hmmmmm!  Normally the developers were
quite open and would discuss anything and everything with you.

Oh well at least I could still run 7.01 unlike most of my KA friends.

There was a difference between "support" and "didn't support".  When
we stopped supported stuff we did our damnedest to not break the
old stuff; there were situations where we simply didn't have a choice
or where we could verify that the old stuff didn't get broken.
So, while we didn't officially support the KA with 7.01, we certainly
were building monitors for the KA (it was a part of our weekly
build procedures to make a gazillion monitors just to make sure that
we didn't break that).  And I was essentially verifying that the
KA software would still run by trotting my stand-alone pack with
this week's monitor build down to System #2 and using it for my
stand-alone machine.

Ah, OK.  So that explains that particular module.  I didn't have
complete control of the packaging and builds for distribution at
that time.  Any _monitor_ tape before the 7-series would have
the real KASER on it.  I would be very surprised if the last
KASER didn't get renamed to another filename and put on the
Customer Supported Tape.  But then that tape didn't get very
organized on I did get complete control of the packaging.  I
can't remember what the development cycle was when I wrote my
first packaging spec.  I think I wrote three of them.  So that
would make my first one to coincide with 7.02.

Oh, some smarty out in the field sold something that required a
device driver.  Since we didn't have any time, funding, or machine
to test the damn thing on using 6.03A as a base for sources, we
packaged a limited shipment for only those customers who absolutely
had to have that piece of hardware and named it 7.00.  It was a
"Limited" ship.  

Do you people remember the LIRs?

They could talk about everything except for the things that were

<snip>

Tim,  I forgot to point out that the KA module that you find on
any 6.03x tape will NOT have any of the bug fixes that would
have been included in the renamed KASER.MAC file that would
have shipped on the 7.0n tapes.

We did fix bugs in stuff that we didn't officially support; we
just never promised to fix every reported bug.

This has been a big bone of contention between PDP-10
developers and certain noisy customers and was the main
reason we put all that stuff in the unsupported category.
It was the only way we could figure out how to get code
out into the field without the horrendous overhead that
support dumped on us.  It was a problem we never did figure
out how to manage; our failure to fix this problem was 
used as data to kill the product line.  

So, you see, all of sudden you're immersed in internal
polictics of yore :-).

My comment about the "CTY having power" meant that the job 
logged in whose terminal was a CTY had more software privs.
I probably shouldn't have used the word power in the midst
of all these hardware guys :-).  Also our ALWAYS.DDT patch
file may have made the CTY even more priv'ed than what
was shipped to the field.  I can't remember what patches were
in ALWAYS.  Ah, one of them was to allow only me to PIVOT to

I've since found the DC20 prints.  It does turn out that the DC20-F
is a DH11 with a different cab kit and distribution panel.  The
"modified" part is that there exists an 8-port DC20, whereas the DH11
was only officially available with 16 ports.  The 8-port DC20 is uses
the DH11 minus one of the 8-port async modules.

KT10 is the memory protection/relocation option for a KA10 processor.

Technically the KT10 was an option, but I doubt that many KA10 processors were
shipped without it, or for that matter the KE10 byte instructions, the
KP10 power fail & restart, or the KM10 fast memory (accumulators).

How, pray tell, was Gates responsible for an IBM decision?  Microsoft was
just a tiny company at the time, albeit the one that produced the good
BASIC for 8-bit machines.

If I'm not mis-remembering (it's been over 27 years since I last touched
one), the S/360 console had ALT in that position as well.

Prefetch was an option, controlled by a bit in the PMAP% call.  Prefetch
is often, but not always!!, a good thing.

MM did a prefetch PMAP% when opening the mailbox.  It made MM startup

The problem was that it was clearly not in the growth path of anyone at Digital
to know anything about 36-bit computing at that time.  We had several attempts
at signing a contract, where the Digital party simply disappeared from view--
left the company, transferred into a different division where they no longer
had any say in the matter, whatever.

The gents who finally got everything together for us, on both the technical and
the political sides, did a damn fine job, but by then the archives were spotty.

It wasn't pigeon, it was parrot.

Alas, Dave Poole was killed last year in a hurricane-force storm in
Glacier Bay, Alaska.  They found some wreckage of his boat, but an
extensive search of all possible beaches where he could have bivouaced
turned up nothing.

under the control of CC341 (I think I can say those

nor did we have source _access_.

Yup.  We sure did. :-)  If it's not a PDP-10, it must be
comm which was a whole different chain of frustrating command.
A lot of our NIH syndrome was caused by "can't get here from
there" problems caused by managers and/or budgets not getting
along.

You're welcome :-).

Dates are useful.  Monotonically increasing version and
minor version numbers according to a strict standard are
even more so.  From them one can tell if the software was 
an architectural, development, or maintenence ship (there 
was a difference in our neck of the world) and the order of 
a product's evolution.  And one could also tell if DEC did 
the ship or a customer (assuming the customer used the set 
of bits specifically reserved for him).

We didn't do autopatch then.  If I had my way, we would have
never done autopatch, as it was written.

And I don't think our MCO file was saved.  Note that not all
changes to the monitor was published in the Update.  Only
the patches that were in response to an SPR and panic fixes
were published.  Also, the MCO only gave the patch iff the
writer of the MCO wrote it on the paper.  Most people didn't
since the FILCOM was a much better way to document the patch.
Those FILCOMs are gone, too, since they were in our listing
box.  I didn't any evidence of listings in the room that had
the last KL in it in Marlboro.  I have no idea if we kept
the FILCOMs of the maintenance listings after we got our
act together.

It was considered a sin back then, too if you had JMF for your

But it didn't allow writes to it.  And all of that got deleted when
access validation became a function of the ACTDAE.  Having LOGIN
do that work was a damn big security hole that we always wanted

You know, I never thought of that.  As somebody who had
to produce her own drum cards after <ahem> discussing 
the format of the data she was about to key in, I had
to do some weird things to smush all that data into
80 columns.  But it never occurred to me that a benefit
of 80 columns was to force programmers to put their effort
into coding rather than naming teensy pieces of data.

CREFed and GLOBed, of course.  I always had line printer 
listings (the wide kind) of the CUSPs I supported.  Then
the world decided laser was a good idea.  Now the habit
was to cram the 132-columned format onto paper that was
build for 80-columns.  Doesn't fit?  Bright idea!  Print
the page sideways.  Then, not only does the poor programmer
acquire crinkles around the eyes from squinting at
characters that have been put on a pixel diet, he now
has to be able to move his neck to a 90 degree angle
to read the rotated text.

Over the years, we had developed some naming standards so that,
if you needed to use a symbol, you usually could figure out
what that symbol's name was.  Larry Samberg rewound UUOSYM.MAC
for me to reflect the naming conventions.  The agreement was
that, if he spent his time getting one revision of the file
into shape, I would "maintain" it for the rest of my life.
Maintaining it usually meant using my virtual baseball bat
on an errant developer but that was their training.  I never
did get TW trained.  To help me figure out if an MCO impacted
UUOSYM (and thus, the monitor calls manual), we eventually
had a box at the bottom of the MCO form that the programmer
ticked if UUOSYM had to change.  That helped me a lot because
it was never clear from the symptom, diagnosis, cure sections
that the code involved a UUOSYM change.

The author of the MCO would tick off the box and I would scurry
around in the listings after the edit to try to figure out
what the appropriate entries into UUOSYM would be.  This was
often _not easy_.  TOPS-20 solved the problem by requiring that
the monitor build use the symbol universal (MONSYM).  That only
worked because their shipping procedures included shipping
CUSPs along with the monitor.  We didn't have that convenience
until I got the packaging and build procedures for the CUSPs
into a managable shape.  When we were able to build and ship
the CUSPs easily, getting managers to foot the budget for
maintenance CUSP releases wasn't as expensive as it had been
since the maintainers didn't have to worry about interfacing
with Release Engineering for every piddling CUSP change.

You are quite right. My memory got muddled by the fact that the York

Maybe it was the way you did your personal file management.  I
always used my DSKB: for the really valuable stuff and DSKC:
was my scratch disk for stuff I didn't care about.  I couldn't
have maintained source control management for all those pesky
CUSPs if it wasn't for the FILDAE.  The [7,3,cusp] area was
"owned" by the developer/maintainer and anybody who wanted to
know who owned a cusp only had to read the ACCESS.USR in that
area (I always inserted a comment giving the ASCII name).
The [7,2,cusp] areas were where I froze the code of the cusps
that were in field test and that's where I picked up all the
sources when building a field test tape.  The [7,1,cusp]
area was the field image and those areas were sacred. Nobody, and
I mean NOBODY, changed any of that software.  If a cusp wasn't
in field test, I copies the sources from the [7,1,cusp] area
to do the builds.

Your assumption is correct.  There was a Tops-20 program that set things up so
that the front-end filesystem was accessible as device FE:, for transferring
things back and forth; I expect that something similar existed on Tops-10.

DEC didn't provide a native Ethernet controller until after the Jupiter
cancellation, when they brought out the NI-20.  This was the same as the CI-20,
with different microcode and a different network interface.  Both used up *two*
RH20 slots.

Long before DEC had an Ethernet interface, you could get a MEIS (MASSBUSS-
Ethernet Interface Subsystem) from Stanford's Computer Science Deaprtment
computer Facility, later also available from cisco Systems.  This is an
interesting device, which resided in the -11 cabinet in the KL for power, but
lived on an RH20.  Looked much like a tape device to the operating system.

The NI-20 could not listen to itself, which made loopback debugging very
difficult; the MEIS had double buffers and worked much better than the DEC
device.

I admit that I'm biased--I know the guy who designed the MEIS, and the guy who
implemented it, and used both in my days at Stanford.

Actually, "P2" may have had an RH10. along with it's DL10.

Of course, it ran Dick Heliwell's (sp) special version of tops-20,
with support for the GT graphics tubes and SUDS.  IIRC, (WARNING: yet
another blonde moment may follow) you had to build the monitor with
the special HELIWELL conditionals turned on.  We actually used to get
an SPR every few months on that, asking what type of machine it was
for.

What was the model number of those graphics tubs, GT44???  Ten land
called them VB10Cs.  Basically, a GT40 with a faster CPU that was
attached to the -10 via a DL10.

Dan did use #546 stand-alone on 5-5 so, yes, code did exist.
I suspect the only way it ever got out to the field (if it
ever did) was under the table.

I don't remember the serial number of Heliwell's KL.  It was
a hardware engineering machine with not much organization
around it w.r.t. operations.  IIR, it was probably the first
KL PC in the world :-).  I do remember when hardware engineering
started budgeting the operations group (I guess you guys call them
sysprogs now) for all the operations support.  Those hardware
engineers suffered from culture shock.

Political correctness.  This all started, I think, with some massive
"human factors" study commissioned by DEC in Europe, which ultimately
resulted in some Din standards and the LK (canoe paddle) keyboard.  I'm
pretty sure this was at least a year or two before the IBM 101 keyboard.
(I remember first seeing the keyboards at a nondisclosure presentation
of... I think it was the Pro 350?... and being utterly appalled.  Of
course the Pro 350 offered a wide choice of appalling features.  Didn't
DEC finally empty its warehouses of them by making them into consoles
for the VAX 8700?)

Before that was a long period of "let the 100 flowers bloom", and some
very nice keyboards appeared, such as on the Concept-100.  Back in those
days, people touch typed, and there was value in having all the keys in
striking distance of the home keys.

The DEC study was basically geared towards making computers (and therefore
keyboards) more friendly to the general non-computer-using public, thereby
increasing the market for computers and terminals.  So as a result we had
to have all these ergonomically huge Return/Enter and Shift keys, and
whatnot (though, ironically, they never thought of a HELP key).  Implicit
in the process was the recognition that (a) the terminal-host model was dead
(so we don't need Ctrl or Esc keys any more), and (b) touch-typing was a
discredited legacy concept (because it is not a mass-market phenomenon).

The ultimate insult to the Old Guard was putting Caps Lock where Ctrl was.
What could be more useless?  This seemed to send us directly back to the
ASR 33 Teletype days when computers spoke only upper case.  (Those of us
who remember the VT50 and earlier still recall the liberating sensation of
entering and viewing lowercase on the VT52 and early DECwriters.)

To add fuel to the fire, various European government procurement bodies
began to *require* the new layout, so by 1983 or so, the only keyboards
available were essentially today's DEC and IBM layouts.  At least DEC
waffled by leaving Ctrl in the same row, rather than moving it way down to
tendon-twisting territory.  But anyway, what it all adds up to is: you're
supposed to be using a mouse, not a keyboard.

And that's why the market for good keyboards is a vanishingly small one.

: [1] Not, if you please, accent grave, unless ' is accent accute.
: I know this is a lost battle, but still, right is right.

Names of characters are assigned in the standards in which the characters
are defined.  The characters in question are defined in US ASCII (ANSI
X3.4-1986), ISO 646, ISO 8859, and ISO 10646.  In all of these, the names
of these two characters are APOSTROPHE and GRAVE ACCENT, respectively (and
yes, in uppercase too :-)

As you can see I don't really believe this is a PDP-10 newsgroup -- it's
more like a clubhouse for people who used to run or use them :-)  Actually,
in those days (20-25 years ago, yikes!) the DEC-10s and -20s were a given,
and terminals and keyboards were the hot topic.  Remember the Info-Terms
mailing list?

Very sorry to hear it, as you are definitely one who knows.
Thanks for the info though.  I had thought both alternatives were
given for both chars.

FWIW, the PDP-10 System Reference Manual, in the 1970 white phone book,
appendix B, Input-Output Codes, agrees that 0140 is grave.  It calls 
047 "accent acute or apostrophe."

I remember some (printing) terminals using apostrophe and grave, and
others that used acute and grave (and tilde also was an accent).  
I don't remember any video terminals using anything but apostrophe and
reverse-apostrophe, though I never used a video terminal that could
overstrike.

Yes!  It was great, including the fab modern appearance of MACRO code
in lower case.  The use of case-independent monitor commands and FORTRAN
programs and so on doubtless stemmed from the way uppercase-only equipment
silently mapped lower to upper case for display.

The aforementioned white phone book has a photo of a KSR37 (on page 121).
I think I've read that it is the reason Unix treats lowercase chars as
first-class citizens, not synonyms for uppercase chars.  It has the
shifted digits with their "correct" values !"#$%&'() , but other stuff 
is much modified:

Left side of KSR33:

         1 2 3 ...
ALTMODE  Q W E ...
   CTRL  A S D ...
  SHIFT  Z X C ...

Left side of KSR37:

   </<        {/[  1 2 3 ...
   TAB        >/>  Q W E ...
PREFIX  SHIFTLOCK  A S D ...
  CTRL      SHIFT  Z X C ...

Right side of KSR33:

   9  0    */:       =/-
   O  P    LINEFEED  RETURN
   L  +/;  RUBOUT
 >/.  ?//  SHIFT

Right side of KSR37:

   9  0    =/-     _/_        }/]        ~/^  |/\
   O  P    `/@     RETURN     BACKSPACE  IDLE
   L  +/;  */:     LINESPACE  DELETE
 ./.  ?//  SHIFT   CTRL

The graphic for 0140 is backquote, but given the dangerous revisionism
exhibited elsewhere, I'm not sure that's a recommendation.  The biggest
thing is probably newline in place of cr/lf.  I had forgotten how nice
it was to have + and * in handy spots.  No ESC, no LF.  No wonder adb
is so crippled.

| Remember the Info-Terms mailing list?

I do not, but I may have read some digests after the fact.  I do 
remember some keypad wars, including the GOLD key, an early victory 
for big-hand-movement computing.

More than just the disks.  The CI-20 was a 50Mbps network interface, with which
KL's running Tops-20 and HSC-50's could be clustered (via a star coupler), and
all access common disks (as well as local disks on each -20, but that lost very
badly).

This was the big news in Tops-20 6.0 (rapidly upgraded to 6.1 right out of the
6.0 field test).  It made it very much easier to spread system load among the
systems at LOTS, and decrease admin workloads, since all 4 CPUs (3 KL's and 1
SC-30M) could access the same user and program directories.  I wish we had done
something with it on the Toad-1.

Out of respect for everything that's decent, let's not say "TU7n."

TU70s TU71s and TU72s came from Storage Technology Corp.  TU78s came from
garbage manufacturers.

The STC drives were, in a word, brilliant.  They were and are the only tape
drives DEC ever slapped their nameplate on that I would trust useful data
to.

Sadly, DEC put a 100% markup on the drive (comparing bought from STC price
vs. bought from DEC price), and instructed STC to never deal directly with
DEC customers.

Instead, DEC pushed those POS TU78s.  An operator, trying to do a backup to
a TU78 (often an exercise that was even worse than a waste of time) would
often find that upon rewinding the tape, the stupid 78 couldn't read the
tape label that it'd just written a few minutes before.  For those not in
the know, this was quite an achievement on the part of the TU78, as the 6250
BPI tape density had so much error correction that you could lose one track
on write and two tracks on read and still get your data back.

If one could buy a TU72 directly from STC, it'd have come at a cheaper price
than what one would pay for a TU78 from DEC, but sadly, Digital's
"Marketing" department took care of that.

To be fair, although the TU70,1,2 drives were pretty inexpensive, the
interface to the -10 or -20 wasn't.  It involved a STC controller
('spensive) and a DX-10 or DX-20.  The latter had wirewrapped components.
The rumor was that Digital had only ever planned on selling 4 DX-20s, so it
never bothered to setup a real manufacturing line for them.  Whether or not
that's true, one place I used to work had 10 of the only 4 DX-20s ever
built. ;-)

An interesting thing about reading blank tape:

TOPS-10 would time out requests.  If it issued a request and didn't get a
response in about 3 mintues, it'd kill the request, and return "Hung
device."  A TU-70 could actually get to physical end of tape on a 2400 foot
reel in that time (it being a 200 IPS drive).  Trying to read a blank tape
could exhaust the entire reel before getting a hung timeout.

FWIW, from memory, TU-70 was 800/1600 BPI 9-Track 200 IPS, TU-71 was a
7-track drive, TU-72 was 1600/6250 BPI 9-Track 125 IPS.

STC also sold a 1600/6250 9-Track drive that did 200 IPS (memory fades, but
I believe it was their model number 3670), but DEC didn't have any channels
that could reliably keep up with it.

How times have changed.  6250 bytes per second at 200 inches per second
turns out to be 1.25 megabytes per second (decimal megabytes).  Today, we'd
turn our noses up at drives that couldn't do that.  The DDS-3 DAT drive on
my PeeCee can handle 1Mb/sec uncompressed;2 Mb/sec compressed, and that
seems slow.

If someone can find the TSU (Autopatch replacement) tapes,
they include online copies of some manuals, basically any
which were updated after around 1988 or so.  DDT probably
isn't included but command references and Monitor Calls were.
I have a copy of these (the documents, not the TSU tapes)
but it is on media I don't have ready access to at the moment.

There were 3 to 4 TSU tapes for each of TOPS10, TOPS20 6.1, and
TOPS20 4.1.  The last would have been issued in late 1989.

I'll see what I can do about getting the documents extracted

Hey Paul,

How did you get the 7 minute figure? Since I ran my updated 476, I if
anybody should know how long it ran for and although my memory is hazy
I think it was more like half an hour without any detectable BUGS. My
spooler also worked without a hitch. Very satisfying after the many
early morning sessions with AEJA debugging it.

Regards,

UC Berkeley's PDP-6 ran TOPS-10 5.07 at the time it was retired.  I have
one of its bit-slice boards.

I also knew the Stanford and MIT PDP-6 machines.  The Stanford PDP-6 and
one of the MIT PDP-6s were still in working condition when I first met
them.  The Stanford PDP-6 wasn't retired until 1980.  Unfortunately, in
1984 it was naively donated to the Computer Museum, which descerated it.

Let's see now...

The PDP-6 had even worse floating point than the KA (I forget the details,
thankfully).  It had that silly PC change flag instead of the useful set
of overflow flags.  It had the same broken implementation of dual-halfword
increments (AOBJN, PUSH, BLT, etc.) as the KA.  The PDP-6 didn't have
JFFO, not to mention the KI instructions (DMOVE, etc.) or the KL
instructions (ADJBP).

Not to mention the program control and pager stuff needed by TOPS-20 and
any halfway modern version of TOPS-10; you'd have to use ancient versions
of TOPS-10 that used relocation/protection registers and thus had The Big
BLT (know to DECies as "shuffling")...read S-L-O-W.   Or you could run an
even more ancient one that doesn't have The Big BLT, and get the old
familiar "CORE AVAILABLE BUT NOT TO YOU".

A single relocation/protection register means that you'd have to recompile
every program under the sun not to use hisegs, and you'd probably need a
PDP-10 to do it, since MACRO and LINK are both twoseg.  Oops, you can't
use LINK, that means good ol' LOADER, heh heh.

Let's put it this way.  You could emulate an 8086 and get it to run some
version of DOS, but the result wouldn't run much in the way of useful PC
software.  A 286 emulator would be the rough equivalent of a KA emulator;
at that point you can run 16-bit Windows.  A 386 emulator would be like a
KI emulator; you can run some 32-bit programs.  But to run modern software
you'd need to emulate a 486 (equivalent to a KS emulator) and preferably a
Pentium (equivalent to a KL emulator).

Now that I'm thinking about it, I recall that when we got the KS10's,
the only thing that ran on them was TOPS-20. (this was before I
worked there by a year or two). Of course, we were a TOPS-10
shop, so that was unacceptable.

I asked a co-worker, and learned that my future boss used the 
existing KA10 to hack the 6.03 binaries so they would boot on a KS10. 

As soon as he could boot 6.03, he altered the sources accordingly and
recompiled.

I don't think we ever had a "real" distribution tape for 6.03...

I'm not sure how much he had to do to get it working, but I seem to
remember a "KSSER.MAC", which doesn't exist in the 6.03 archives.
I believe he stole the KLSER.MAC and modified to fit... how hard
would it be to get a KS10 running hacked KL sources? Would you

The HSC and Star Coupler peripheral hardware for CFS-20 (Common File
System) was the same as for VAX Clusters.

CFS-20 started working in-house before VAX Clusters did.  (I wouldn't be
surprised if Clusters shipped before CFS, though).

As one of the members of said group, I feel entitled to pick nits.  :-)
That's the "MOS Technology" processor.  Mostek was another company
entirely, and produced the Z-80, F8, 3870, and (later) 68000.  But
there was never a "Mostek 6502".

MOS Technology was acquired by Commodore to become Commodore Semiconductor
Group.

I claim FOCAL as my first programming language, having pawed through a
PDP/8 FOCAL Handbook at the age of 8 (some 30 years ago), and
scribbled a few program modifications on paper based on the stuff I
was seeing.  I took it to my dad, who figured out how to get the high
school to get me weekend access to their ASR-33 connected to a HP2100
system, and I started programming in BASIC for real, instead of in
FOCAL on paper.

I never got to run anything on a PDP/8, or anything that runs FOCAL.
But it's still my first programming language.

If you still want to, you can run focal on my PDP-8/E.

Use shortcuts->run program select languages then one of the focal versions.

That was true originally with the HSC50, but apparently the required
support for 576-byte (8-bit-byte) sectors was dropped in later versions
of the HSC, and even in later software for the HSC50.

I'm still looking for a CI20, HSC50 and suitable software.

CRONIC 3.50 was the last 576 byte sector version. Finding
the disks would be an even bigger bitch...

Hum... hack on an HSJ and use SCSI?

I was at the Vegan Decus in 83. They had a pair of 780s clustered
and a CFS-20 next to each other.

All the demo machine where sold off at half price. I got a Pro 350.
Someone bought the 20, on a credit card! This caused a shock-horror
to the 20 people as their carefully move proofed demo machine was
about to vanish... I heard they did a 'deal' and another system
was shipped asap.

So if that was not the first shipped, then it was the first sold.
Pre Clusters. I installed the first cluster in Europe in Jan 85.
Or so DEC Holland claimed. We ran it for about 15 min...

Sure.  I'd finish putting those diagnotics in some kind of 
_documented_ order.  I type PRINT FOO.BAR and not have to
wait for it.  I could submit a test build and yak with you
guys waiting for it to hit the next error.  <gasp>  I could
even get online in two minutes rather than the 15 minute 
procedure I do before I dial out just so I have a snowball's
chance in hell not viewing a BSOD.

Give me the tools, I'll figure out something useful to do.

Well, even the weediest PeeCee can do I/O better than ANY VMS system.

Used to be to laugh to watch the Digital salesdroids go out and try to bench
VAXen against -10s.  They'd keep throwing bigger and bigger CPUs at the
problem, never realizing that the issue wasn't one of CPU speed but the fact
that VMS can't do I/O to save its life.

I never thought of -10s as being big I/O pumps - I mean, all you had to do
is go hang around some 370 running OS/VS1 MFT LSMFT if you wanted to see
real I/O.  (Not that there was anything else you'd ever want to do with a
370, but it sure could pump bits.)  VAXen and VMS made the -10 look like a
long haul bit-flinger by comparison.

VMS was an operating system that was senile before its first
ship.  Of course it's not going to do anything efficiently...
other than spend a lot of time thinking about what it should
do next.  

I didn't have much problem with the VAX architecture (well,
quite a bit of it didn't make much sense...but what do I know),
but the software implementation was just a repeat of what we
saw in the early 70s.  There's a really good reason that 
"small computer thinking" can be read in two ways.

We fucking blew it with the VMS implementation the way we
did it.

Uh, no.  I'm really tired of Cutler getting credit just because
he was a funcking manager.  When I started at DEC, 1971, he
was already a manager and it was other people who did the 
real work...despite his insistence that his name get put

That's what happens when you try implementing timesharing with
a task mentality.

But of course that's all it was.  Heaven forbid that PDP-10
experience be noticed.  Should I point out that Bell, Cutler
and Hosvedt(sp?) did NOT have accounts on any PDP-10?  I take
that back.  Bell had an account; it was used twice with a connect
time of about 2 minutes/session.

These people didn't know what timesharing meant let alone how
to design or program for it.

Another example of Digital eating its feed corn.  JMF didn't have

There is an Australian Computer Museum Soc (WA) meeting on
Sunday. I'll have a good look and see if the TOPS-20
Installation Manual is their, and get it scanned. I'll
also do the 6 manuals, the ones one the net are the maintance
manuals, thought they prob have the info in them.

And somewhere, I have the users guide for 'TN', dated
April 65. This program was on a Bendix, the moved to the
6.

The interesting thing is the load and run instructions!
What, run from object files??? Ah, yes, the first version
of the loader didn't 0 compress. Not good with DECtapes
as the main storage...

But that is another story.

I know.  That doesn't answer the question about the reason
to lock at system startup time.  The only reason to lock is
to prevent access while the file is getting updated.  By design,
the only program accessing that file is the ACTDAE.  And I 
certainly don't want to preclude valid reads of that file by other
programs such as BACKUP...ever!

You should read the explanation again.  Every word was chosen
carefully to convey the precise meaning and functionality.
Pay especial attention to the word "when" in the phrase
"when accounts are associated with their ppns".

They do have to lift a cuticle.  And you would have if cost center
341 had not owned all the hardware.  You would have had to
enter your Discrete Project Numbers whenever you logged in.
However, I had anticipated that one, too and had a painless
design just for that case because of the following edict given
to me.

In addition, one of the
constraints of the accounting project was that I would not
impact any other development and that included causing a 
developer to enter a few more characters to a new prompt.
Now, think about a devlopment project that touched just about
every system utility and plan the project so that it is
invisible to every using any system software.  I am so
glad that I went into that project stupid.

Also, I was _the_ system accounting expert at DEC.  AFAICT, I was
the _only_ system accounting expert at DEC.  :-)

Nope.  TOPS-10 7.03 was Phase IV and certified as a Phase IV.
TOPS-20 RElease 6(I'm not sure that's the corret version)
was a Phase IV and certified as a Phase IV.  I also certified
both -10 and -20 at some point in time when they were Phase III.
I also finished up the Phase II certification for TOPS-20.

Actually, Barb, I'm pretty sure that on a multi-reel saveset, there would
have been actual EOF marks at the end of each reel.
When writing the tape, when Backup would hit physical EOT, it'd write an
"End of tape" backup record to flag the restoring process to go to the next
reel. Now, by itself, the restoring Backup could certainly decide to stop
reading when it saw this "end of tape" record. It's just that it used
buffered I/O, and the monitor, not knowing what a Backup "end of tape"
record looked like, and not caring (on read) about the physical EOT marker,
could well go on filling buffers ahead of Backup. With a sufficiently large
buffer ring, that'd run the tape right off the supply reel.
The way we prevented these things from happening back in the bad old days
was to write an EOF mark (which really meant writing a logical EOT mark)
after Backup's "end of tape" record, which would stop the monitor from
trying to read additional buffers. Backup probably wouldn't notice this EOF
mark (or care about it) on read, because it'd stop itself with the "end of
tape" record it just got.
Logically, yes, a Backup save set would be one file on the tape, but on a
multireel set, an EOF mark does ensure that the drive doesn't dump vacuum on
you.

I can echo this - in the mid 70s, after the recession began
sliding away, we had customers asking how DEC would protect
their software investment.  We, a bunch of central engineering
folks - including gordon bell - had looked at the future and
said that the software costs were going to out pace the hw
costs..moores law, kens law and all that...the price for 
semi memory was coming down and folks were starting to ask
for the ability to build an application once, have it move to
a new platform and run faster!  So, of course, being a HW
company dec did all the smart things....not.

That was an earlier designation.  I have in my possession a number of binders
(in a nice chocolate color) with the words

	DECsystem-4050
	 Sales Training Seminar

printed on them.  (I got my first from Mark Lottor, at the 1988 DEC-20 Day
luncheon; the others came from Joe Dempster.)

So Jupiter was going to be a DEC-40.  Tops-40, perhaps?  After all, wasn't it
the sales/marketing folks who renamed the PDP-10 to be the DECsystem-10?

Well, one thing popped out at me in your MACRO-10 in-line literals example:

        CAIL B, FOO                     ; IF (b < foo) THEN
         PUSHJ P, [                     ;   BEGIN
                HRROI A, [ASCIZ/.LT./]  ;     message = ".LT.";
                SETOM LESS              ;     less = -1;
                AOS (P)                 ;   END (skip around ELSE-part)
                POPJ P, ]               ; ELSE
         PUSHJ P, [                     ;   BEGIN
                HRROI A, [ASCIZ/.GE./]  ;     message = ".GE.";
                SETZM LESS              ;     less = 0;
                POPJ P, ]               ;   END;
        PSOUT                           ; PRINT message;

As I recall, within such a literal "." was still the instruction that was
referencing the literal, so rather than use time-expensive PUSHJ/POPJ pairs
in such simple cases, usually this would be written like so:

        CAIL B, FOO                     ; IF (b < foo) THEN
         JRST [ HRROI A, [ASCIZ/.LT./]  ;     message = ".LT.";
                SETOM LESS              ;     less = -1;
                JRST .+2]               ; ELSE
         JRST [ HRROI A, [ASCIZ/.GE./]  ;     message = ".GE.";
                SETZM LESS              ;     less = 0;
                JRST .+1]               ; ENDIF
        PSOUT                           ; PRINT message;

or even the uglier and less-well-structured (and less-maintainable):

        CAIL B, FOO
         JRST [ HRROI A, [ASCIZ/.LT./]
                SETOM LESS
                JRST .+3]
        HRROI A, [ASCIZ/.GE./]
        SETZM LESS
        PSOUT                           ; PRINT message;

However, the power of MACRO-10's *macros* was really where the magic lay!!
I found it relatively straightforward to write a set of simple Algol-like
(today we'd say "C-like", I guess) block-structuring macros to provide
IF/THEN/ELSE/FI, CASE/ESAC, WHILE/DO, BEGIN/END, etc., and LOCAL, which
allowed stack-allocated variables (including arrays) inside a BEGIN.
If you said:

        BEGIN			; allocate a stack frame
        LOCAL   A,B,<C,10>	; allocate variables within that frame
        ...
        MOVE    T0,A
        MOVEM   T0,C<5>         ; or maybe "c+5", I forget
        ...
        END

it defined "A", "B", and "C" as macros which were offsets indexed
on "S" (the stack pointer), and the whole thing expanding into:

        SUB     S,[XWD 14,14]
        ...
        MOVE    T0,0(S)
        MOVEM   T0,7(S)
        ...
        ADD     S,[XWD 14,14]

If pressed, I'll repeat the story of the incredibly complex byte-strip/
character-table-building macros I wrote for my FOCAL-10 (which was a
nearly-direct transliteration of Doug Wrege's FOCAL/F for the PDP-8)
which let you do FOCAL's "SORTC" and "SORTJ" lexical scanner/dispatching
functions in only *two* PDP-10 instructions. Oh, what the hell, here's
the short version:

Suppose you had a vector of routine addresses (a dispatch table) that you
wanted to branch through based on which "equivalence class" a character
is in. You could define the equivalence classes with the C.LST macro [once],
then whenever you needed to branch based on the character currently in
register "C", you did a "SORTJ":

lex_classes:  c.lst  <<(,[,{,"<">, <">",},],)>, <+,-,*,/>,
		      <<a,z>,<A,Z>,_,$,%>, <<0,9>>>
lex_jumps:    word   left_brackets
	      word   right_brackets
	      word   operators
	      word   identifiers
	      word   numbers
	      ...
	      ; next char is in "c", classify & dispatch
	      sortj lex_classes, lex_jumps
	       [...here if C in none of the classes in "lex_classes"...]

The SORTJ macro expanded into only two instructions:

	      ldb    t0, lex_classes
	      sojge  t0, @lex_jumps(t0)

The SORTC macro (FOCAL's other major parsing function) also expanded into
only two instructions, but since it was only concerned with testing eqv.
class membership and fetching the index, it didn't need a jump table -- the
SOJGE just jumped to ".+2" on success, leaving the (adjusted) index in T0.
[Or it may have used an SOJL, I forget. There's something tickling my memory
about SORTC being "backwards" in its skip behavior...]

The C.LST macro expanded into only one word, a byte-pointer, but in the
process of doing that it also defined just the right assembly-time symbols
so that just the right bits of the right character table [there could be
more than one, the macros automatically allocated a new one if you ran
out of bits in the current one] had the equivalence class index [with "0"
meaning "not in any class"] for each character in the right "byte strip".
[A "C.TAB" macro at the end of the program planted all of the merged
character tables at once.]

Since FOCAL is basically just a character-at-a-time interpreter, using
these techniques I was able to get a factor of *25* speedup in runtime
performance of the FOCAL interpreter on the KA-10, compared to FOCAL-8F
on a PDP-8/e [even though for low-level character/small-integer bashing
they were usually fairly close to the same speed!!].

The cache wasn't write-thru.  Debugging the monitor was a PITA
since the CTY wasn't really a CTY.  Visual cues were gone
other than the external memory lights (it's so much faster
to take a look at the CPU's lights than type in locations
to the front end terminal and have it display via ASCII.
For really hairy symptoms, it was just another level
of complexity to have to deal with a front end system.  
Trying to figure out if the problem was a 20F problem or
a -10 problem or a 20F/PDP-10 problem was enough to make
a pro quit.  It was unsettling to leave bit pushing to 
some unknown mini-developer...especially the "unknown"
part.

The HSC development had the same problems.

Not only that, but the original Super-FOONLY (PDP-10 architecture CPU
implemented in ECL gates) was at Stanford, and IIRC there was quite a
bit of controversy around that time over just how much of DEC's first KL
design was "borrowed" from the FOONLY (and on the flip side, how much
help from DEC the Stanford folks did or didn't get).

A more-or-less neutral and/or more complete re-telling of that story
would be appreciated... Anyone?

Are you sure you don't mean *1979*?  We got a fairly-low serial number
*KA-10* at Emory in 1970, and IIRC the KI was much later than that.
And the KL used ECL IC logic, which AFAIK didn't even exist in 1969.

But I don't really know the exact chronology (which is one of the reasons
I asked for someone to fill in some details). The Jargon File entry
<URL:http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/Foonly.html> says:

    "ARPA funding for both the Super Foonly and the new operating system
    was cut in 1974. Most of the design team went to DEC and contributed
    greatly to the design of the PDP-10 model KL10."

I suppose if one looked in the DEC-10 DECUS Proceedings for the right
year (anybody got an index online?) one could find the talk the Stanford
guys gave on Foonly...

According to <URL:http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/models.txt>, the first KL
was announced in 1974.

The KI seems to have been announced in 1971 or 1972, see
<URL:http://pdp10.nocrew.org/cpu/ki10-year.html>.

Here's another quote, from "We Call Them 10's - A Brief History of
36-bit Computing at CompuServe" by Alexander B. Trevor:

       But by 1976 a more pressing problem arose.  DEC had released
   the KL-10, but it seemed prone to overheating (ECL does generate a
   lot of heat). Dr.  Goltz felt we needed a faster processor, but the
   KL was unsuitable.  We looked at Foonly's F1, but were uneasy about
   their ability to actually produce machines.  So, with two of our
   best engineers, Doug Chinnock and Wilson Mowbray, John Goltz set up
   an R&D center in Tucson, Arizona, to build a better 36-bit
   computer.  In 18 months, they had several large boards, microcode
   that avoided all the DEC patents, but were still a good year from
   having a production machine.  Jeff Wilkins was running short on
   enthusiasm (and cash) for the project, and it looked like DEC had
   really solved the KL-10 heat problem with the DEC-System 20
   configuration. Not only that, but the price of the 2050 was at
   least $100K lower than the 1090.  Internal memory and devices on
   RH-20's seemed not only more efficient, but saved us from having to
   add cache sweeps to our monitor. If we could run our operating
   system on this machine, it might make more sense than finishing the
   "JRG-1" processor.

I started at dec in Jan of 69.  In March I asked a question that got me
into a couple of interesting discussions with 10 land.  I asked if 
"we" (dec) were doing anything with ECL.  At that time, it seemed that
the design of the KL had started, at least looking into an ECL machine.
I first worked with ECL gear in the 67/68 time frame at my previous
employers facilities.  I don't know when fairchild and others
announced their ecl lines, but dec was at the forefront of technology
deals in those days.  In 79, 10K ecl was around, and 100K was rumored.

I recall that DEC bought the entire mill, where I worked, and put a
bunch 
of 10 systems on the first floor of building 1, I was on 1-3 at the time
and the 10 folks were either moving or had moved to marlboro.

Maynard had to have a power upgrade to power up the first KL in 
Maynard, I do recall that!! and that was maybe around 72/73.

Barb, you have a better memory for those dates than me, I was 
sliding from 8 land over to the newly formed, Tom Stockebrand
led, DECComm11 group.

I've been trying to remember just where building 1 was.  I've
discovered that my memory of the locations are all based
on which footbridges I had to take to get there from 12-1.
I do remember one time looking out a window knowing that 
the building I saw was the one I had to get to but, other
than hiring Superman, I had no idea how to get from here
to there.

One of the myths that new hires were told was the metric
that supervisors used.  An interviewee was led to some
place in the mill and left.  If the interviewee could
find his/her way back to a particular office, s/he was
hired on the spot.  And no blindfolds were used.

You and I never had much call to go there.  Hmm.  My memory is getting
fuzzy too!  Ah, my map reminds me.  Building 1 paralleled building 3
and is next to the mill pond.  You can take bridges from 3 to 1 to 5,
whereas we generally went from 3 to 5 (with just a few steps in 4.)
Building 1, IIRC, had the stairs between floors on the _outside_,
presumably a fire protection design.  They were also on the north
side, and the wind really swirled around in January.

On my first day, I was afraid that afer orientation I'd be expected to
find my office.  Fortunately, someone sent you to rescue me.  For my
first two weeks there my map was my most important possession.  After
I got good getting to my office from either buldings 5 or 12 I started
trying to take a different route each day.

IIRC, the KI-10 running Tops-20 I mentioned a few posts ago was in 1-1.

Yes, you did have to go outside to get from
the floor to the stairwell at (at least one end) of building 1.

And don't forget the tunnel from 1 to 3 as well (which
I used a lot, because I spent some time in a terrible office on 3-1).

Was that the tunnel on 3-6?

>(which
>I used a lot, because I spent some time in a terrible office on 3-1).

There was an office on 3-5 where the floor on one end was 6 or
7 inches higher than the other end.  I don't think I ever got down
to 3-1.  My route was usually 12-1, up those stairs to 12-3,
across the tunnel to 3-5...and now I don't remember how I got
down to 5-0, the home of System 40.

Wasn't 3-1 the home of some other little businesses until we
bought the Mill?

Head down the 3-5 hall away from 12, go past the TTY room and some
vending machines, down a few steps (into 4-?), zig right, zag left, up
some steps to the tunnel to 5-3, stairs down to 5-B (Below pond
level), past Salvage to the computer room.  And that was located before
the sewer connection.  Once in a while a saw a cat down there.  Never
saw a rat.

Well, I'm jealous.  I have a feeling that only my feet know

The routes I always had trouble with
were the ones that involved buildings 6a and 6b (the buildings
where you sometimes had to go down a floor and up a
floor to get from one end of a floor to another) and the
associated spiral-ish wooden staircase.

Nope. There was a tunnel which started in mid 3-1 and
ended in the central stairwell of building 1. You could walk through
it, but it was full of giant pipes that said things like "hot
water return" on them.

Introduction years (from memory, may be off):

PDP-6, 166 processor, system modules: 1964
PDP-10, KA10 processor, flip-chip modules (mostly R- and B- series): 1968
PDP-10, KI10 processor, TTL flip-chip modules (M- series): 1972
PDP-10, KL10 processor, ECL flip-chip moduels (M-85xx): 1975
PDP-10, KS10 processor, TTL & AMD 2901 bit slice (M- series): 1979

I agree that it seems very unlikely that any of DEC's hardware design
efforts in 1969 were directed toward what became the KL10.

There are a lot of variants of the KL10 processor:
  KL10-PA:  Model A, 1280 word microcode store, single section only
  KL10-PV:  Model B, 2048 word microcode store, supports muliple sections
  KL10-PW:  MCA-25 upgraded Model B, more cache and PTEs (1095, 2065)

The -PA and -PV processors were offered with and without cache, and with
and without internal channels.  The DECsystem-1080 and -1088 did not use
internal channels; all other KL10-based DEC-10s had them.  The
DECSYSTEM-2040 did not have cache, but all KL10-based DEC-10s and all
other DEC-20s did.  The 2040 could be upgraded to a 2050 by installing
the MCA20 cache upgrade.

> And the KL used ECL IC logic, which AFAIK didn't even exist in 1969.

Motorola MECL-I ECL existed in 1968.  It was not nearly as "easy to use"
as 10K ECL.  I'm not sure when 10K was introduced.

   Why on Earth would anyone buy a KL sans cache?  From tests I ran
back when I was at ADP (and I'm really beginning to rue my decision to
"will" the body of my notes to one of the other chaps there when I
left!) a KL running without cache was slower than a KA (which really
points out that the -10 was memory-bound).

   Interestingly, tests using the timing diagnostics pointed up similar
results with the KI-10.  Most of the memories we had at the time were
the 1 microsecond MG-10s (along with a smattering of MH-10s);  when we
received our first Ampex ARM-10LS (semiconductor ECC memory using, if I
recall, 1k x 4 chips), I ran performance tests using both KLs and
KIs.  The KIs benefited more than the KLs from the 250nS speed
improvemnt of the MOS memories.

   It was all for naught, of course.  The fast memories went onto the
KLs where they'd do the least good (save to cut down on the number of
memory boxes per system).  The best memory architecture I've ever seen
done on a -10 (a KL) was a 4-way-interleaved, one K-bus-to-each-box,
system done up around ARM-10LXes (of 1 Mw apiece); the thing was a
work of art.  I forget who did the work on it, but he has my
congratulations for it.

It was cheap, that's why.  The 2040 was originally positioned as the el
cheapo entry model KL with 128K; essentially to replace the KA.  It ran
TOPS-20, since TOPS-20 had a swappable monitor and so would run on
machines too small to run TOPS-10.

Marketing thought that people would buy these as COBOL boxes.

   That's right up there with "No Czechs cached"!  Thanks for the
anecdote and the good laugh it provoked!

   The availability of the 2040 might have had a lot to do with a
purchase of one, but I suspect the price/performance mark was rather
off the main.  One could have done much better with an old KI system
(or even a KA-based one) for the price.  And A/C, and power, if not
floor-space, especially if one could self-maintain such a system.

The lab where I worked in 1977 also bought a 2040, and
it worked well in a 200 person government research lab,
though there was also an RJE to a 6600 and lots of minis,
plus it took time for folks to get used to using time
sharing.
The attitude among management and many of the 70+
scientists was that support personnel were the ones to
actually touch keyboards. We did have 384k words of
memory and that made a difference to performance over
the usual 256k.

When we decided to upgrade, people were solidly convinced
of timesharing and an upgrade was needed. Field Circus was
in doing a regular provocative maintenance (PM). The tech
noted that the upgrade kit was in and suggested doing the
upgrade at the end of the PM time. He did, rebooted
the system and everything worked fine.

An hour later, a scientist came running to me saying
that one of his analysis runs that usually took 1/2 hour of
CPU
time had finished in 15 minutes, so there had to be
something
wrong with the system. I then told him what had happened.
This
provided a demo that cache on the 20 provided a 2:1 speed
increase for a scientific / Fortran environment.

   I've seen the memo.  Is XKLeTen still in operation?

   In any event, I suspect I'd better qualify my comment above.

   There was never such a machine as a PDP-20; they were, to a one,
rebadged -10s running the TOPS-20 operating system.  For instance,
the DECSYSTEM-2065 is a repackaged KL-10E in a "Corporate Cabinet"
with MOS memory running on an internal "S" bus.  The DECSYSTEM-2020
runs TOPS-20 on KS-10 iron.  I do not believe that anyone at DEC
ever referred to a PDP-20 (the line dropped dead at 16 with three
non-starts).

   PDP-10s, on the other hand, originated with the original PDP-10
(later rebadged "KA-10") and ended up with the latter-day KL-10s
and ran the -10 "Monitor" (TOPS-10 was a back-fit to make DEC's
markerters happy and, according to rumour, enraged certain folks).

   Hopefully that clarifies my (perhaps warped) view of things.

   Thanks for explaining who "F" is.

   Cheers.

Actually the machines with "internal" MOS memory run the memory on the
"X bus".  It's logically the same as the "S bus", but electrically
different.  When upgrading to the MF20 or MG20 from earlier memories,
it is necessary to replace one or both S bus translator boards with
X bus translators.

Also, while there was not a PDP-20, DEC did sometimes refer to the
corporate cabinet KL10 as a KL20.  It was not common usage, and I haven't
seen it on any engineering drawings, but it did appear in a few manuals,
and in _Computer Engineering_.

> The DECSYSTEM-2020
> runs TOPS-20 on KS-10 iron.

There were order numbers in the super-secret Modules and Options List
for the "1020", which was a KS10 shipped with TOPS-10.  However, that's
just an ordering number and AFAIK they were never called DECsystem-1020.

Nope.  I had to stop working in 1987..or maybe it was 1986.
Ken was still there. I was doing those &^%&DECnet certifications
for Phase II, III, and IV.  I think that covered the years 1982
through 1986 (7.03 was Phase IV).  Certification covered Ultrix
but not that other Unix (whatever the hell that unix was).  I 
never could get DEC's unix business straight in my head.

I think it was after I stopped working that JMF did SMP in 
System V Unix.

A quick grep of the Ultrix 3.1 sources reveals no Digital Copyright
earlier than 1984 so I would guess that's a pretty safe bet on when
they started their own development on it.

No, DEC did UNIX development well before 1984.  We initially ran
V7/m on our 11/44 in 1981.

V7/m was V7 plus DECs mods to allow it to run on the 11/44, RL01/2
support, etc.  It came from a group (whos name I've forgotten) within
DEC.  Key people @ DEC involved were Fred Canter and Armando Stettner.

V7/m preceded Ultrix.

Nope.  You can't rely on the copyright dates.  84 was around
the time that the edict came down from on high that copyrights
had to be in everything.  The mini people were a lot laxer
about copyrighting sources than the -10 people.  When Tape
Prep did all the keying in of sources for the mini people, we
would put in copyrights for them.  Some programmers would
immediately take them out.  I don't know why, but the -10 
people were more conciencious(sp?) about that legal stuff.

I think it was said here, but to reiterate.

What he said was that Unix was like a russian truck. And that anyone
pushing it for 'serious' work was selling snake oil.

Or words to that effect.

K.O. made a number of interesting quotes over the years.
Some were often misunderstood.


"There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in their
home."
		-- Ken Olson, President of DEC, World Future Society
		   Convention, 1977

I believe K.O. was in favor of an information utility supplying
computing services, backups, storage... to individuals with smart
terminals.   Kind of timesharing with the echos of CompuServe,
and the current Network Computer idea.

  
  	One of the questions that comes up all the time is: How
  enthusiastic is our support for UNIX?
  	Unix was written on our machines and for our machines many
  years ago.  Today, much of UNIX being done is done on our machines.
  Ten percent of our VAXs are going for UNIX use.  UNIX is a simple
  language, easy to understand, easy to get started with.  It's great for
  students, great for somewhat casual users, and it's great for
  interchanging programs between different machines.  And so, because of
  its popularity in these markets, we support it.  We have good UNIX on
  VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.
  	It is our belief, however, that serious professional users will
  run out of things they can do with UNIX. They'll want a real system and
  will end up doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.
  	With UNIX, if you're looking for something, you can easily and
  quickly check that small manual and find out that it's not there.  With
  VMS, no matter what you look for -- it's literally a five-foot shelf of
  documentation -- if you look long enough it's there.  That's the
  difference -- the beauty of UNIX is it's simple; and the beauty of VMS
  is that it's all there.


		-- Ken Olsen, president of DEC, DECWORLD Vol. 8 No. 5, 1984


I think this one's really interesting.  And... pretty accurate.
You can replace Unix with Linux and VMS with WinNT and see Microsoft
saying this same thing.

'course the five-foot shelf of docs are things like Windows Undocumented
secrets.

  
  "TCP/IP is OK if you've got a little informal club, and it doesn't make
  any difference if it takes a while to fix it."
  		-- Ken Olsen, in Digital News, 1988
  

These three quotes are part of the MOTD on my FreeBSD 4.2 system.

I don't think so.  DEC stuck with DECnet and (later) OSI protocols far too
long.  Meanwhile, TCP/IP started making serious inroads in Europe, working
TCP/IP code was available for cheap from BSD, and OSI was far too complex
and most implementations were far from complete.

DEC was selling Ultrix (I think 2.?) when I joined around 1987.

KO gave a talk at (the site across the street from LTN) in 91 or so, 
and said that one of the issues he was thinking about was whether to
put Ultrix on the Alpha.  We strongly urged him to.  I think that
DECstations using MIPs chips  which ran Ultrix but not VMS had been
out for a couple of years then.

I think it was earlier than that that KO called Unix "snake oil."

There was Ultrix-11 (PDP-11), Ultrix-32 (VAX), and Ultrix for MIPS (don't 
recall the name).  The last OS to support MIPS was Ultrix V4.5 (Y2K stuff).
On the Alpha you had OSF/1, then DEC Unix, and now Tru64 Unix.

On the PDP-11 you also had various non-DEC Unix's (including of course AT&T
Unix), and BSD 2.11 is still actively maintianed.

On VAX you've also got the original BSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.

On Alpha you've also got Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, and you had OpenBSD.

If all that isn't confusing I don't know what is!  Of course none of the
above touches the question of weather or not a specific model is supported
:^)  Also I've probably missed a few Unix variants in the above :^)

There was an Ultrix-11 for (some of) the PDP-11s.
There was Ultrix-32 (but it always seemed to be just
Ultrix near the end) for VAX and MIPS (the CDs were labelled
something like ULTRIX/VAX and ULTRIX/RISC so you could
keep them apart).

> and then osf on the mips and vax and alpha?

I don't think OSF/1 *ever* ran on a VAX. It did run 
internally on MIPS and it shipped on Alpha. I think
the problems arose because (some) customers had been
lead to believe that OSF/1 (i.e. the future) was going
to be supported on MIPS and made plans accordingly 
(like buying more MIPS boxes). When OSF/1 never made 
it to MIPS these customers were apparently none
too pleased.

> what turned into tru 64????

OSF/1 turned into DEC Unix and thence into Tru64.
AFAIK, OSF/1 never had anything to do with 
Ultrix and presumably shared no code with it.
OSF/1 was initially devreloped outside of DEC
(although I think DEC sponsored the project in
some way). DEC was one of the few (possibly the
only!) vendors to make use of OSF/1 once
it came about.

This is all from old (and not recently
refreshed) data cells ...

Your brain is working perfectly well. OpenVMS did
receive the X/Open branding (I think that was the
one). IIRC it was the first (and possibly only)
non-Unix OS to receive that. 

That was aout the time that the VMS -> OpenVMS
name translation started.

I recently took an application I wrote using C++, sockets and
POSIX threads, and ported it to VMS 7.2 w/DEC C. Besides file
permissions and naming conventions, I had no problem
running the exact same code as I did under Solaris,
FreeBSD, etc.

All in the name of an experiment.

I think Barb is spot on here.  There was a discussion with Bell
a couple of years, maybe 4, before the KC started.  The general
consensus was that SW was going to be the hook that kept folks.
The investment in apps, training and all that would keep them
if the performance could continue to improve, features could improve,
and so on. SOund like Microsoft?  That reall was the discussion.
I recall Stan O, Ken, Dick Best, and a bunch of folks in the meeting
over by Ken's office.  Lots of marketeers too. I don't recall a single
LCG person.  This was around 76 or 77.  This seemed to me to
be the justificaiton behind things like killing off the 8's,
ivesting all the big bucks into the vax family of efforts,
and so on.  The KC failure - way behind schedule nad over
budget -  might have been fuel needed to kill off all but vax.
After J11, I think all the 11 stuf was repackaging.  the concept
of 11 compat in the vax, to get folks to migrate, stopped after 
what, the 750? Was that in the 730?  SO, there was the key to
ending the evolution of the 11. The 8 was already dead, the 
10 was being bled dry, imho, and so...vaxination happened.

Look, the 10 was not a "commercial" system in the sense of
an IBM or such - Customrers were coming up with improvements to
the OS, these improvements were rolled in, and how can you charge
folks more for features they thought up? Yeah there is the
"productization" effort and support but ....

Oh well, off the soap box.  BUT Barb is spot on.

Run with about 11/34 speed on a 750. The code was quite small.

It was called ZIGLET. Named after one of the developers nicnames.
My Alpha is named for both!

Not officially anyway. DEC did support KS-10s running TOPS-10. The sources are 
full of IFN FTKS10,<> conditionals, and all the processor and device specific 
modules were on the release tapes post 1978 or so.

But John,
I recall you only being a year or two older than me, and I haven't
aged, so you can not have aged.  Kotok, Ku, Kent, Bingham, Hess, and
Melanson all aged.  McClure, Bugs, you and me did not.

I won't say a word about BAH tho..

Exactly! but going beyond that made things a bit tougher on vaxen.
NOt just from a marketing standpoint, but from a complexity
standpoint too.  I know th PDP10 fortan folks were hot to do it.

After the initial shock of the PDP-10 cancellation had worn off, DEC
talked to the customers to figure out what to do.  The conclusion was
that one third of the accounts would stay with DEC, one third were
unretrievably lost, and the middle third was up for grabs.  However,
when the Integration program ended, well more than the optimistic upper
bound of 2/3rds of the accounts allegedly stayed with Digital
(in some sense).

BTW, note that it was in early 1983 that it was decided that TOPS-10/20
8-bit ASCII support would store each character in a 9-bit byte.

Dig this: in a newspaper interview given around the time of the Compaq
buyout, Palmer stated that after the handover he intended to open an
office in Boston and ``become more closely involved in the local
electronics industry''.

That's how I met Tony Wachs.

Once Fortran-10/20 V7 (or was it V10) was well along in development in
Marlboro, I smoke-tested it the way SITGO was occasionally tested at
Stevens Institute - I fed a binary (the FOROTS EXE) into it.

It caused a job stopcode, if not crashing the entire system.


Some weeks later, Tony showed up at my office early in the evening while
hefting a dump magtape and asked what I had done.  I told him and we
tried it again.  The system no longer crashed.  He left.  (I don't know
if he found the monitor bug or not).

The explanation for 0176 is a simple one: that was the code for ESC
in ASCII-1963.  0175 is more mysterious, since that was the "unassigned
control" reserved for future standardization, so it's not clear why
Teletype would ever have shipped a keyboard that generated it.  The only
clue I have is a January, 1963 description of the yet-to-be-released
Teletype Model 33, which describes the character as follows:

  ALT MODE...... Provided for a future means of communicator escape -
                 primarily to be utilized as a switching function and/or
                 for set expansion.

Does anyone know whether the TWX network actually used this character
for switching purposes?

I can't find the reference right now, but as I understand it TOPS-10
would translate any character 033 received from a terminal into 0175,
since that's what software was expecting to see.

From DECsystem-10 Assembly Language Handbook, Third Edition,
DECsystem-10 System Reference Manual, Second Edition, December 1971,
Third Printing, Appendix B (Input/Output Codes), pp. B2, B5:

"
				TELETYPE CODE
Even	7-Bit	Character	Remarks
Parity	Octal
Bit	Code
...
0	033	ESC		Escape, prefix.  This code is generated
				by control shift K on Model 35, but the
				Monitor translates it to 175.
...
0	175	}		This code generated by ALT MODE on
				Model 35.
1	176	~		This code generated by ESC key
				(if present) on Model 35, but the
				Monitor translates it to 175.
...
"

The above table is telling in that it indicts the TTY35, but misleading
because the companion DECsystem-10 Monitor Calls manual for 5.06
was already favoring 033; the following functionality was the very
newest terminal line attribute (.TOALT).  From TOPS-10 SCNSER.MAC
of 28-Jun-88:

"
LPLALT==:040000		;ALTMODE CONV. (1:CONVERT 175,176 TO 033)
"

By then, everything expected ESC/ALT/PRE to be 033, and as shipped,
TOPS-10 would translate 175 and 176 to 033 for TTY33's and TTY35's
by default, and not touch the codes for other terminals by default.

Not for ages.  The DECsystem-10 System Reference Manual, Third Edition,
Aug-74 says in the analogous table:

"
				ASCII CODE
Even
Parity	7-Bit	7-Bit	Character (10)	Remarks
Bit	Decimal	Octal
...
0	027	033	ESC	Escape, prefix.  This code is generated
				by control shift K on Model 35, but the
				Monitor translates it to 175.
...
0	125	175	}(13)	This code generated by ALT MODE on
				Model 35.
1	126	176	~(14)	This code generated by ESC key
				(if present) on Model 35, but the
				Monitor translates it to 175.
...
10	Codes 140-173 first defined in 1965.  For a full ASCII
character set the Monitor accepts codes 140-176 as lower case.  For a
character set that lacks lower case, the Monitor translates input codes
140-176 into the corresponding upper case codes (100-134) and translates
both 175 and 176 into 033, escape.  Early versions of the Monitor used
175 as the escape code and translated both 176 and 033 to it.
...
13	Unassigned control character (usually ALT MODE) before 1965.
Code generated by ALT MODE key on most DEC units.
14	Control character ESC before 1965; | 1964-67, but never on DEC
units.  Code generated by ESC key on some DEC units.

The DECsystem-10 User's Handbook (Nov-71) says in the DECsystem-10
Hardware appendix to the Introduction to DECsystem-10 Software manual:

"
A.1 DECsystem-1040

The 1040 is the smallest of the five systems.  The typical configuration
of this system has a KA10 central processor, 32 to 64K high-speed ME10
core memories, the RP02G disk system with up to two disk packs, the
TM10G magnetic tape system with up to two drivers, and low-speed
peripheral equipment including a CR10F card reader, an LP10A line
printer, and local DC10 lines.  This is an excellent system for the
scientific research lab where multiple real-time tasks and general
computing are required, and also for small colleges where there is a
need for handling administrative, student and faculty workloads
simultaneously.  The system is easily expandable with most equipment on
the DECsystem-10 Equipment List.
"

It goes on to describe the 1050 (KA with drum, modems, ...), 1055
(dual master/slave KA), 1070 (KI) and 1077 (dual master/slave KI).

However, somewhere I have a document outlining the four oldest packaged
DECsystem-10 configurations.  Could be an original; could be something
historical quoted in the past decade or so.  The *highest* one in
the series is the 1040; the 1010, 1020 and 1030 are all more anemic.
Some if not all of them systems lacked disks (swapping to DECtape, if
at all), and were missing things like fast ACs or floating point
instructions.

All this well predates the KS.

Yep, the 782 allegedly came out in ``1982'':

(I've never knowingly used a model 33 that was generating 175 or 176
from the ESC/ALT MODE/PREFIX key.  Of course, I may only have used
late model 33's).

Oops, I phrased badly.  Even TOPS-10 6.03 (30-Sep-78) didn't keep track
of terminal types (TTY33, LA36, VT100, ...) on a per-line basis.
However, by the time of 7.03 (circa Aug-88), saying ``.TTY TYPE TTY33''
(or TTY35), would do an implicit ``.TTY ALTMODE''.  That normally would
translate 175 and 176 to 033, but if the monitor was built using of
contrarian setting of STDALT==175, then 033 (and 176) would get
translated to 175.

I can believe it was a mistake for the .TTY TYPE TTY33 attribute table
entry to imply .TTY ALTMODE.

My vague recollection (from the ten or so 33s I've had), is that if you
want 33 (ESC), you have to type CTRL-SHIFT-K, the ALT MODE key sends a
curly brace or whatever.

I stand corrected, but confused.  To settle this, I decided to go to
the source and so I just crawled into my storage area and tossed
all the junk off the top of the ASR33, turned it on, turned on the
tape punch and hit the ALT MODE key a number of times.  After
a fuzzy start (it hasn't been powered in a couple years at least),
what I got punched on the tape was 175 (base 8) (actually 375 as
the parity bit is always on).  Hmmm.....  My late 70's semi home
brew 64x16 video terminal with the George Risk TTY style keyboard
has that key labeled ESC and it generates ESC.  Maybe that's
what I was thinking of?????

I first heard most of HOSS/TSG was shifting to Engineering on 18-May-82.

KO met with Engineering to announce the cancellation of Jupiter on
17-May-83.

DECUS was on May 23,1983
The Dear Customer letter wasn't till Jun 8,1983
    For all the good things in Alpha and TRU64 I think I would have
preferred they had rolled the dice and kept going, I mean, how bad could it
have gotten - assets stripped and sold too a PC company. Oh that's right
that did happen ;)

    Cheers

?  Are you thinking of DECNet-10?  ANF-10 is from about 1975?  We had
ANF-10 on our KI in that era.

And speaking of how to get into the system - why via a DL-10 simulator, of
course :-)  That way we can run both a KI and a -11 simulator :-)  Who

I forget if it was netser, but ANF-10 implemented the .set host command.
Terminals on the remote stations and front ends always tried to connect
to some DEC-10.  If it wasn't the one you wanted, you just did a
.set host to the one you did.  To my ARPAnet/telnet centric view, it
seemed pretty over done.  After all, an Terminal IMP (TIP) had its
own command scanner and let you do the equivalent of set host to many
different OSes around the world.

>Compaq appears to be self-immolating ala Digital.

No, mostly a lack of appreciation for DEC's heritage.  Compaq just
hasn't been around since 1957.  They're getting better.

Business-wise Tru64 Unix is doing well in HPTC, Telco, biology, etc
markets.  So that's good.  Even VMS is growing.

Actual name was "Common File System".  576-bit/sector RA81's, an HSC-50 or two,
a star coupler, and a CI20 interface (took up two RH slots) on each KL.  Came
out with Tops-20 v6.0; we field tested that release at LOTS (3 2065 systems,
and eventually a CI in the SC-30M).

Each KL could have local disks as well as CFS; these could be configured to
allow access from other KLs in the cluster, but that suffered the same problems
as NFS version 1:  No such thing as a soft mount--remote host dies, you hang
till it comes back, and since Tops-20 hates hung systems, you die too.

GALAXY had a new member added, called NEBULA.  This allowed GALAXY to communi-
cate around the cluster; I know that print requests were possible, but don't
remember about batch--we didn't do a lot of batch on the heavily-loaded LOTS
systems, too unfair to the students.

I have a copy of the conversion docs people used to implement the first
TCP/IPs at work.  I think the date is 1978 or 1980.  I don't think there
was ever a "switchover", for a while I think the protocols and hardware
were supported both.  However, I was completely uninvolved with all that.

The NCP addresses were 8 bits - 6 bits for IMP node number and 2 bits for
hode hanging off the IMP.  E.g. at C-MU we had one IMP and two PDP-10's
names CMU-10A and CMU-10B.  The other two ports were unconnected, though
C.mmp (multimioi processor) may have been connected after I left.

And yet, it almost was!  In August, 1985, Tom Hastings, the chairman of
the ANSI X3L2 subcommittee, wrote to Byte Magazine (pp. 24-26) that

  During 1984, three draft 8-bit character set standards were
  developed for the Latin languages of Western Europe and the
  western hemisphere with identical 8-bit code tables.  The
  ANSI draft is called 8-bit ASCII....

I wish I knew what happened between then and 1992, when ANSI finally
published a copy of the 1987 ISO 8859-1 standard under the 8859-1
name rather than calling it ASCII.  The 1986 version of the ASCII
standard even includes "7-Bit ASCII" in its title, as if to leave
open the possibility of a non-7-bit ASCII to follow.

True.  Maybe what confused folks is that 1026 had 8 RS04s as swap
space.  They were used for nothing else, and were not part of SYS:.

IIRC, they were in three cabs on the right end of the front row of the
system.  (except for the tape drives).  There was a wrench hanging
inside one of the cabs so you could spin up the disk(s) after power
fail.  Some number of them always failed to spin up due to the heads

Hell, I wasn't there after 7.01, so how would I know?  I was there in
the "6.xx" time frame, and early 7.00 development, about the time that
Tony, Jim, and CDO got really pissed at Bruce Evans.

The BBN network group is now Genuity; owned by Verizon (formerly

Looking at http://www.bbn.com/ reveals that the AI group is now part

I'm saying it didn't get shipped as a product.  There may have
been some sites that were running as a prelim field test (I'm
not sure since I was in Tape Prep and I didn't have access to
how the monitor group did its field testing at that time.)
He certainly could have had two processors bought and had 
software done to run them as master/slave eventually ...those
marketing people promised the universe in those days.  However,
in 1971 when I started working at DEC the monitor group was
on 3-5 where we did the monitor edits.  There was only one
processor (System #2) there.  

Now I certainly could be all wet but I do remember that, when
I got fired from Tape Prep, one of the things I had to do was
remove the group from the test dual system because my replacement
was incapable of doing any kind of field testing.  One of the
hardest things I had to do was to go to TW and apologize for
dropping out of the load test.

I could certainly be wrong but the withdrawal out of load test
was an embarrassment for me.

Nope.  You can't rephrase that ;-).  SMP didn't replace
master/slave until 1980 when we shipped 7.01 (SMP
is the reason that the major version number of the monitor
went from a 6nn to a 7nn).  Might as well document the
rest...

The version number went from a 4nn to a 5nn with the introduction
of the Level D disk system.  (There may have been other aspects
to that release, too...John Everett could tell us more.)  I was
only at a customer site when that happened.   The version number
went from 5nn to 6nn when VM was done.

Yes, I saw him about 2 (3?) years ago for lunch, and he was still 
smoking I think ... the trashcan fires were legend. We all colaborated
in watching him and making sure he didn't throw anything in the
trashcans!

Yup, that story was passed around too. The irony was that they refused
to maintain a machine that never left the corporation!

I had a lot of fun with the KS10's. While not a PDP-10 in the purest way,
it was still a good facsimile :)

Oh, grumphalopolis.  Not queuer.rel.  I sincerely hope that
GALAXY software doesn't have file of that name.  It is doubly
imperative that you restore languages to their own directories
and not to system directories.  Sara Murphy had this brain
fart that all files required by a product should be shipped
on that product's tape (somehow her logic did not seem to
acknowledge that the monitor software was a basic requirement).  
It's one of the reasons we got into the WILD and SCAN mess 
in the 70s.

Not much out there.  I have a document that mentions the SDS-940 in
passing, but nothing specific to that computer.

http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc34.html

	The real-time clock for an 940.  Note the RFC number.

http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/paper-t20.txt

     1.3  A Detour And Learning Experience

          Taking DEC at its word, BBN turned  its  attention  to  selecting
     another machine, hopefully one with an expanding future, that we could
     use to support our various research  projects.   The  result  of  this
     selection  process was the purchase of an SDS-940.  SDS was Scientific
     Data Systems in El Segundo, California, later acquired  by  Xerox  and
     known  as  XDS.   The  SDS-940 was a 24-bit word machine with a modest
     virtual address space, but it did have hardware  paging  capabilities.
     Also,  SDS  was  touting  as  a  follow-on,  the  Sigma-7  then  under
     development, which would be larger, faster, and do all the  things  we
     could  ever  possibly  want.  If it did, we never found out because by
     the time it came out, the DEC KA-10 had been announced  (or  at  least
     leaked),  and  we  happily switched back to the architecture we really
     wanted.

Would be interesting to know if ANY of this software survives today..

The SDS (ne XDS) Sigma series is a COMPLETELY different animal,

Yup.  I can't remember where I read this.  The supposition was
that he really missed that guy and went over the edge due to it
along with the fact that he no longer had a sanity check he
could trust.  

Jim and Tony didn't go over the edge when TW left DEC.  But
they sure missed each other for those sanity checks.  They
had worked together for so long that the sanity checks didn't
seem to have to be 100% verbal either.  TW went to Wang where
he was the only "old" guy.  He had no one to talk with when
he got stymied.  JMF was more fortunate in that he didn't have
to establish a new territory (at least for a while) but he didn't
have his equivalent "old" guy to yak with either.

Google search for "Logo harvey papert history" quickly returns a FAQ at
http://ekstern.alu.hist.no/~dennisgl/logo/logo-faq.html which says:


  2: What was the genesis of Logo?

  According to Wally Feurzeig in his article in *Digital Deli*, 1984,
  Logo was named by him at BBN and Paul Wexelblat built the first
  turtle on the floor. The name of the article is Logo Lineage. In the
  article Seymour Papert was called in as a consultant on the
  functional characteristcs.

  [Linc, James Internet: Gowj @ novavax.nova.edu] 

  Logo was developed at BBN in the 60's, Seymour was a consultant on
  the BBN project. The first implementation of what we now know and
  love as Logo, was written in LISP (surprise, huh?) on a PDP-1 (at
  BBN). Its name was "ghost".

The PDP-10 (mainframe according to some definitions) version was written
in assembler.  Both machines were built with discrete components and well
predate TI's Logo.

As I mentioned elsewhere, I added Turtle support to the PDP-10 Logo
for people at the University of Pittsburgh.  I forget the exact year,
but probably 1973 +/- 1.  They got their code base from MIT or BB&N.

Brian Harvey is very active in the Logo community and on comp.lang.logo
and knows far more than I.  (Hi Brian!)

2 and 3: did not exist, or possibly only engineering samples

5 was the original 8, same relationship to it as 6 to 10

9 is part of the second 18bit architecture.


Here a rough listing:

12bit:  PDP-5/PDP-8 and (LINC/)LINC-8/PDP-12
18bit:  (TX-0/)PDP-1 and PDP-4/PDP-7/PDP-9/PDP-15
16bit:  PDP-11
32bit:  VAX
36bit:  PDP-6/PDP-10

Bracketed machines are non-DEC machines DEC improved on.

I was actually using non-DEC as non DEC designed in this case.

AFAIK (ACM article[1] by LINC designer[2]) LINC was an MIT Lincoln
Labs design. The first were hand made by their users(!) in an LL
workshop. Later DEC produced them in series.

[1] A History of Personal Workstations, Adele Goldberg (ed),
    Addison Wesley, ISBN 01-201-11259-0 - totally recommended
    "The LINC was early and small", page 345

[2] his remark about one user (an neurosurgeon) having trouble
adjusting an potentiometer because it was "too fiddly" is really
scaring.

Probably because a MAJOR CUSTOMER wanted to deploy many 2020's to perform 
circuit design and analysis, and at that point in time, the 7 series was 
still a LIR.  It was probably better to add support for the 2020 into an 
already stable release, than give the customer the 7 series.

There were two groups Barb might have been thinking about.  One was
known as DAS.   DAS manufacturing was over in Burroughs Plaza, BP1.
They build all the "specials", like the DS-10 frontend for the KA and
KI's, and the DN6x stuff for the IBM RJE support

The other Group was "Federal Systems".

In Marlboro, circa 1976, both groups sat in the middle of the 2nd
floor, on the very back of the building.  (right where the "bend" is.
The area was kind of behind the RSX-20F group, which was at the time,
run by Fred Howell.  Later, the DAS group and RSX/ANF group merged and
was run by Tomas Luffgren (sp).

After a few years, when training had moved to Bedford, Federal Systems
was moved to the office space under the old stock room in the south
end of the building.  (First floor) The stock room would later be
converted to the cafe.

I seem to remember John having an office in the Federal area under the
cafe, right behind Bob Houk's and Nancy Lapelle's cubical.

Your memory must be fading John.  In the LCG world the HOSS (later called
COG) group wrote fixes and answered the SPRs.  This was not the case in the
rest of the company, where dev always did the fixes and answered the SPRs..
The support/maintenance group was the one that Dave Oran was in.  I can't
remember the name of the guy in that group who rewrote a good chunk of
TOPS-10 networking (and then moved into the dev group) when he got stuck in
MR1 during the Blizzard of 78.

<snip upsidedown post...tsk..tsk>

The guy who did the best work (and stuck with it) was Todd Matson
but I don't remember the snow war stories including him.  AFAIR,
Cliff Romash was the only developer who got stuck at the plant
for a week.

Harumph :-)  In 74-75 when I was there it was still one function - answer
phones and SPR's.  There was quite a difference between monitor SPR's and
everything else, though.  The Steves had to submit MCO requests to Jim and
Tony to get fixes done for real.  Everything else we edited ourselves.  I
talked to Norma about F10 or David about MACRO/LINK, but we had access.

Dammit, John.  We told you no already.  At that time, there
wasn't real networks.  The only comm stuff that went out 
as a GENERAL release was DC72 and DC76 was very new.  And
these worked as a terminal concentrator.  

I'm beginning to remember why you were so damned irritating back
then.  Even virtual baseball bats weren't effective.

Yup.  We fixed that when the Tuesday morning meeting was established
to review all MCOs.  Then the maintenance guys were able to 
communicate what they wanted to have edited via the MCO book.
The side effect of that was that JMF and TW or (more importantly)
anybody could take a gander at the MCO book and the listings.  If
they had an objection, they could go to the Monitor meeting or send
a rep (for those who absolutely couldn't function at 7:30) to object,
suggest, or whatever.

The Steves were very good about testing and knowing how to code
the monitor.  However, it took a SCNSER disaster of the first
degree to get the process of MCO approval into place.

That's because only one person was "in charge" of a product and could
control what went into the sources.  The monitor was a different beastie.
Source control was a nightmare.

Perhaps my memory is fading.  I don't remember ever
teaching HOSS how to support any of our products.

I barely made it home (to New Hampshire) the evening

It was.

That was the problem.  Nothing matched.  There was a CUSP
tape plus 22 update tapes.  If Conklin fixed a DIRECT bug
that required a later edit level of SCAN, his solution was
to ship a new SCAN with that DIRECT on an update tape without
testing the SCAN edit with all the other CUSPs that used
SCAN.  Things got so bollixed that his solution to the 
bolluxing was to create SCN7B.REL and have DIRECT search
that.  So the developer or maintainer who had to answer
an SPR, or worse yet, try to do some developement really
didn't have a set of sources to start with.  I remember
lots of programmers wondering around asking which MAC
file was the real SCAN.  WILD had the same problems.
And then somebody, not to be named here, in the Language
group decided to ship SCAN on their tapes.  And their pick
of sources to work from had no semblance in the field.  

Nope.  It was more of mess than you thought.  There was
even a scenario (which I can't recall at the moment)
that guaranteed no installation from scratch could be done.
The only reason customers ended up with a system was because
their cold start installation was done in Marlboro when
manufacturing did their checkout.  Manufacturing left their
checkout system on the customers' disks.

But DIRECT wouldn't necessarily work with the SCAN that got shipped
on a language tape or a later CUSP update tape.

Not if they had to do a cold start installation.

Oh, I'm not talking about that.  I was addressing his idea
of getting the 6.nn cusp tape (note the singular?).  There
were no Cusp tape.  There were essentially 23 cusp tapes
with no installation instructions.

I used MIMIC to simulate a PDP-11 so I could debug

I recall that it was easy to add new I/O devices.

Sarr J. Blumson wrote (excerpted):
"I always thought that the original implementation of RPG 
was done by RPG."

The CUSP was coded by Bill Weir, who also designed
the whole thing.  RPG (Dick Gruen) modified the
Fortran compiler and Macro assembler.  I hacked
the monitor to enable the CUSP to learn the name
of the command that had invoked it.  Bill gave it
to DEC, who renamed it CCL, perhaps because the
name RPG was already being used by IBM for one of
their programming languages.

Dick Gruen was a DEC employee at that time.  Bill

It all depended on where the stuff was.  If it was a disk
pack stored in the machine room, you fill out an
operator work order.  If your stuff ever went through Magee,
she made sure that it got archived.  

If the stuff was paper like project plans, functional specs,
etc., you asked for a document retrieval number, added it to
the document, then sent a readable printed copy to the 
retrieval group.

>Was

Release Engineering kept one.  Anything done through
an operator work request had some kind of number or something
written on the request which you were to retrieve and keep.

>Did you need to get permission from someone to

No.  You just had to do the work like filling out a form.

>

If you had bothered to listen to those who were trying to
tell you, you would have known.  And I know Magee tried
to teach you because she would come to me to vent and I
would go off and "fix" it.

A lot of your stuff was archived...you just didn't know
it because...<shit...the bug I just smashed fell into my 
oatmeal>...we did it behind your back in spite of yourself.

Sigh!   SPR answering impacting the devlopment groups was
the result of a strategy to remove the reason that Bell was
trying to cancel the PDP-10 line.  The evidence used to

Job slots for the TOPS-10 Monitor group when from 3 to 12 and we
could get those fantastic people who implemented Phase IV DECnet.

You started working on it via HOSS/TSG way before my time.

I now see that by 18-Aug-82, you, Eric and Ed Smith were no longer
attending Fortran meetings, and we had already picked up Rhonda, Mike
Boucher and Tom Speer.

I can't find Jane's initials in the Fortran revision histories, which
makes me wonder whether she might indeed have been working on Cobol
until she joined the Nighthawk C compiler project in the summer of '85.
(We weren't shotgunning Cobol people with Fortran mail, though).

Presumably SPRs weren't getting answered because of the time lost in
moving the maintenance role into the development organization.  No
corresponding mention was made at the time of any impact on development.

And on the other hand, Bill Johnson gave all of LCG Layered Products
a free lunch at Finally Michaels on 3-Mar-83 for having closed the
entire LP backlog.  (Appetizer: best cream of chicken soup I ever had).

It took longer for the O/S's and their utility backlog to get under
control.  I'd have to consult a t-shirt for dates.

[John Everett](excerpted)
Sorry I've not been available to comment on this thread 
until today. During the late '60s and early '70s I was 
"Mr. Magtape" in the TOPS-10 group. During the early 70's 
the magtape service routine was called MTXSER. I rewrote this from
MTASER while we were still in the mill 
(very early '70s?) to support multiple magtape controllers 
(kontrollers?). I did the preliminary design work for what 
became TAPSER and friends before leaving for First Data in 
September, 1974. Ted Hess and Len Bosack (I believe) picked
up this development from my design.

I don't now recall John Sauter contributing anything 
substantial to MTXSER, but then memory does fade with 
time. In any case, if ANY changes were made to MTXSER, 
they would have had to come through me.

[John Sauter]
My memory fades too, but here is what I remember.
The magtape service routine for the PDP-10 had a lot
of octal constants and a very convoluted error
handling algorithm, which didn't work.  I replaced
the octal constants with symbols and arranged for
a small push-down stack per tape drive, so the
error handling code could be written linearly.
I then added code which simulated errors, and used
it to debug the error handling.  When it all worked,
I submitted it to DEC in an SPR.

I don't remember exactly when I did this, but it must
have been between 1969, when I arrived at Sanders,
and 1975, when I left.  It was probably early in
that period.

Does any of this ring a bell?

Nope.  That was standard operating procedure.  People
in those days honored other people's work.  In the -10 
world, people who tried to take credit for others' work
were "corrected".

My memory keeps being off-by-one when I try to remember
year numbers.  I guess I keep underestimating how much
work I did; IOW, I packed in about a year and a half of
work into one.  :-)

I'm embarassed as a TOPS-10 developer that those bugs are there.
We, of all people, should have learned our lesson with DATE75.

Excuse me.  I don't like that.  I'd rather have everything
on one logical tape rather than depend on two restores.  Your
approach is how we ended up with 23 CUSP tapes getting shipped
to a new customer site in the 70s.

Good!!!!!!!   I've been trying to get that "fixed" for years.
AFAIK, I'm the first one who insisted on using a 4-digit year
when we designed my USAGE files.  I got very abused at my
design reviews and presentations.

At least most of that is sources.  I don't have a clue since
people didn't "autopatch" the patches (a myth in our group
perpretrated by the group that brought us autopatch...can
you smell some politics in that line ;-)?).

Sounds OK.  As long as you end up with source code...I don't
care much about how you get there.  Try to keep in mind that
I think people are going have to do the exact same things
if this code collection gets lost.  (I'm pessimistic today.)

Since the available simulators are currently for KS10s, you're
obviously limited to what will run on a KS10, which rules out
all but the last few releases of the operating systems.

Yes, *ALL* the versions of the OS are lost.  Except for the few that
people have found tapes for.  If you've got older versions or know where
to find them, please let us know.

Never noticed it up to now. Good you today just picked a day when I
have a bit of time free.


> who knows will listen: *Is* there a MIME type for 36-bit binaries?

No there is not. I just went and looked at the official standards
document (thats what the time got used for), RFC2045, at
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2045.html

This sniplet says it all:

-------------
6.  Content-Transfer-Encoding Header Field

   Many media types which could be usefully transported via email are
   represented, in their "natural" format, as 8bit character or binary
   data.

..

   It is necessary, therefore, to define a standard mechanism for
   encoding such data into a 7bit short line format.

..

   mechanism := "7bit" / "8bit" / "binary" /
                "quoted-printable" / "base64" /
                ietf-token / x-token
-------------

So MIME seems to have been invented as an n*8bit world only.


But we do have an possibility, as they left the back door open:

-------------
6.3.  New Content-Transfer-Encodings
   Implementors may, if necessary, define private Content-Transfer-
   Encoding values, but must use an x-token, which is a name prefixed by
   "X-", to indicate its non-standard status, e.g., "Content-Transfer-
   Encoding: x-my-new-encoding".
-------------

So what about making such an extension, like when formats for storing
tape images in 8bit files got defined? Multiple possible implementations
come to mind:


1) send 36bit on 8bit channels as 2*36bit in 9*8bit. If there is a
single 36bit left over pad it with 4 or 36 zero bits. This seems to
be what FTP does in Image mode, if I get RFC354 right. Call this
version x-36bit (or x-6bit analog to 8bit for n*8bit data).

For mails this poses a problem because it will need to be additionally
base64-ed, making it one encoding in an other.


2) send 12/18/24/36bit data as n times 6bits each packed in one ASCII
char. Call this version x-6base64. This is more universal and already
mail compatible. But it is inefficient for HTTP/Web.

As coding for the latter one could use that used in base64, which
first does 3*8->4*6bit and then stuffs each 6bit into one ASCII.
The table for this from RFC2045:

-------------
     Table 1: The Base64 Alphabet

     Value Encoding  Value Encoding  Value Encoding  Value Encoding
         0 A            17 R            34 i            51 z

4) define both 1) and 2) for HTTP/Web and Mail respectively, just like
there exist 8bit and base64 for n*8bit machines in these 2 circumstances.


3) no new encoding at all. Simply make an standard 36bit in 8bit
file format, like with (derived from?) the 36bit in 8bit tape
container formats and then use an normal 8bit web server.

This method would just use the file ending and resulting MIME
Content-Type: for controlling the whole process.



Note that in addition to an Content-Transfer-Encoding: we will any way
need additional Content-Type: entries for the typical files. Looking
at RFC2046 we will have to use application/* types. I suggest:

application/x-sixbit            for SIXBIT text
  text/* is not allowed for this, as that hast to be ASCII derived
application/x-sextet-stream     for non-specified n*6bit binaries
  analog to the official octet-stream for n*8bit
application/x-tops10-exe        for TOPS-10 .EXE, TOPS-20 analog
  same also for all other file types, object files, ...
  this analog to some of the x- types on the SGI machine I looked at


There is also an RFC2048 which describes the procedure for having
types added as official extensions to MIME. So if we design a standard
we could even have it officially blessed.

Oh, dear. That was mine. And I don't remember for the life of me
who asked for the change or why.

*Please* tell me no one runs PA1050 any more. Please. That would be
far too disturbing for words. What am I supposed to tell my children?

Actually.. maybe I do remember. That was my first year at DEC, fresh out of
college. From college I brought with me a game using the cute shared hiseg
trick that -10 supported. I probably *did* try to run it under PA1050 to see
what would happen... and I certainly would have fixed TRMNO if I caught
it failing. So there probably wasn't an SPR at all; we didn't generally 
fill them out internally. The guess about the game was a good one.

One of the glories of DEC was that you could do a lot of things without
paperwork. There are a large number of additions I made to -20's TV that
I suspect never got out of the documentation group.. including ways to
invoke jsys's, store additional buffers in extended memory sections (which
brought the -20 to its knees), and so on. It was far too cool a language not
to beef up. :)

I do miss TECO. Every time MiSery Word helpfully decides to insert
inappropriate formatting for me, I remember the good old days, when 
editors just did what you told them, and otherwise stayed out of the way.

There was an SPR as I recall submitting it. The printed response said
something like "your suggested change has been accepted verbatim" (if
that rings any bells) . I'm fairly sure there was a game involved but
I think I managed to demonstrate something else failing which was
considered supported. Might have been some obscure switch to PIP or
something.

Yes, Bob Supnks's guide on these pages (parts 1 + 2) and the TOPS-20
7.1 installation guide is close enough. Also I nearly fell over when I
saw *

"Introduction to using the DECSYSTEM-20, originally from the Dundee
College of Technology (TEXT)" also on these pages.

As that's the machine I used to run! Even more surprising is it was
retyped by an ex student there who now works for me with my current
employer on VMS. The author credits are DEO/KLB who were Duncan Ord
and Kay Black but the version online is the 1983 edition updated by
myself. Think I might have printed copies of the Dundee Tech guides to
EDIT, BASIC, FORTRAN, TOPS-20 advanced etc at home if. I could only
find them and scan them in.

In these days I was:

Alan%DCT@UCL-CS.ARPA

or COMPD-ARG%DCT%DDXA@UCL-CS.ARPA even earlier

Had a TOPS-10 PPN before that but (shame) I can't remember it now with
any accuracy.

We took part in the TOPS-20 V5 field test and had online copies of
*all* TOPS-20 docs from that time as part of the kit. I am still
trying to track down tapes on which these might still exist..

Hmmm...

I remember reading that Bill & Paul used the Intel 8080 Cross-Assembler,
MAC-80, on the DEC-10. Intel distributed this as generic FORTRAN on 9-
track ANSI-labeled tapes, and it was up to the user to port it to the
platform of choice.

I ported it to both the DEC-10 and to the CDC-6600, as well as the Prime,
along with the INTERP-80 interpreter and the PLM-80 compiler (all of
which I have managed to preserve and carry forward to today).

However, you're describing the 8086 version of MASM, aren't you, as
you mention 'DOS'...

Which reminds me: the 8080 version of the MBASIC compiler, in the
manual, has a page that refers not to CP/M, but to something called
'MDOS', and the page includes a short snippet of the command-line
environment, as if typed from a teletype printout. The shell in use
had a "." prompt.

I've suspected for years that Microsoft internally had an OS, most
likely 100% ripped off from CP/M, that they used for developing their
products.

I heard that they wrote Macros in PDP-10 assembly to emulate an
assembler for an 8080, and that Paul wrote an 8080 emulator to
run on the -10 for testing what they wrote...

RSTS Basic+2 code is quite close to VAX Basic. The only problems you
have
compiling RSTS Basic+2 programs on the Vax are due to system library
issues
[sys() calls] and some file handling differences (at least in my
experience).
Almost everything compiles without any problems after these are fixed.

Later versions of RSTS Basic Plus (intrepreted basic) were quite
similiar too.
(The older versions of RSTS Basic-Plus had short variable names,
and a 255 byte line length limitation, both limits went away at the same
time they added the "extend" keyword)

Of course.  At least, if they didn't, I'd remember that!  Kind of a
nice terminal, but too long, too prone to cigarette smoke collection on
the plastic screen, and it actually needed fill characters for its
recirculating memory!

Yeah, if you haven't used DDT, you've missed a nice assembler language
debugger.  Ran on -10, -11, Alliant's Concentrix (half the OS crew had -10
experience and several of us had the documentation).  And, of course, it
was the command language for ITS on MIT's PDP-10s.  I did the same for
a disk patcher program - I defined user opcodes that trapped to routines
that did disk and LPT IO and could execute single instructions or patch
in loops, searches, whatnot.  I wrote a DDT-like debugger for C/PM and 6502
for a music teaching system I was involved with.

Line at a time debugger command make as little sense as line at a time
editor commands.  DDT fit like a glove.

It was very rare to connect two Teletypes together.  Computers were quite
adept at receiving CR and emitting CRLF.  Still are.  Ever typed a Hayes
compatible modem command?

One reason for keeping the two functions separate is that CR could take
more than 100 msec, so ending CRLF gave the carriage time to get back to
the dash pot.

There was a period where many terminal mfrs started calling the CR key
"enter" instead, and would provide a configurable code to be sent. You
could often choose it to be Control-J (linefeed), control-M (CR), or
both, which was/is called NEWLINE. NEWLINE became a platform-dependent
code, and was the sequence of one or more bytes that are interpreted
as linebreaks for sequential files with variable-length records.

Seems the ADDS Consul 580 was among these...

On early RSTS/E Basic+, they used the return key to specify that a line
was complete, and a linefeed to specify line continuation.
Stored in the source file for a linefeed were the characters
<LF><CR><NULL>,
and for a return <CR><LF>. I'm guessing the null was to allow teletypes
the time to return the head that was lost by swapping the characters.

Later versions used <and-percent>/<return> "&\r" for line continuation,
and ended all lines with <CR><LF>.

Huh?  When you punched on an ASR each character was printed
(or otherwise actioned by the printer) and punched; those were
mechanically linked (at least on the 33, not sure of the 35 here).
CR and LF were separate printer actions and separate punches.
I think I recall Teletype making keyboard-to-punch-only (no printer)
models for dedicated use in e.g. telegraph offices but I never saw
it used in a computer application, probably not cost-effective.

> It was very rare to connect two Teletypes together.  ...

On the contrary it was very common.  Teletypes were originally
designed and primarily manufactured and sold for telegraph/cable
and newswire operations which consisted of transmitting text
keyed or read from tape on one Teletype in one place to a second
in another city/country, or sometimes multiple others -- hence
the name.  The Bell system (as it was then) had an entire network
called TeletypeWriter eXchange (TWX), separate from the (voice)
telephone network.  DoD similarly had AUTODIN (automatically
switched digital network) vs AUTOVON (ditto voice).

Using Teletypes as computer terminals was a post-facto repurposing
because they were widely available (both the devices themselves
and supplies, parts, maintenance, etc.) as a result of the above.
_As computer peripherals_ they were never(? or rarely) multipled.

True.  Actually for a full line (72 characters) it could take more
(3 or even 4 character times) so even after CR LF you needed
to add one or two padding NULs, or an equivalent time delay,
or the first character(s) might be out of position.  Of course
prompts tended to be short, and listing lines often began with
spaces and/or sequence numbers so this was no great loss.

OTOH LF nominally worked in 100ms so you could slew paper
with consecutive LF's (no CR or padding) -- which could be
done from the keyboard just by holding REPT + LF --
but if there was unusual drag e.g. something touching
the paper feed roll this might jam and stop altogether.

OK, once the red rod had been passed through the paper roll and
the paper rested on the top of the ASR33. The paper was then fed
(from the bottom of the roll) into the gap below the platten. There
must have been a platten release, but my memory (brain and finger)
can't remember where the release was - I suspect on the RHS.

Feed paper through (using knob on LHS connected to platten). Up
past the clear plastic shield and under the ribbon. Adjust platten
release to grip paper. Keep/start working.

For many months after our DECsystem-10 became available, I used
to keep the paper from each session for reasons I can't understand
but I remember finding them in the bottom of my bag for a long
while.

Back when I implemented the "new" telnet client at C-MU, all the telnet
processing ran at interrupt level.  Instead of having telnet code get
characters and instead of interrupt code passing (possibly incomplete)
strings to telnet code, I used a coroutine.  The interrupt code just ran
through the messages and switched to the telnet code with each character.
When the telnet code started processing a command, it essentially used the
PC as a state variable to track where it was.

Worked really well, and was always my favorite piece of ARPAnet code I wrote.
Now, as for the FTP client I wrote in BLISS....

You're both right:  The Compuserve OS spun off from Tops-10 v. 4 (I think 4S72)
and went its own way.  Most of this was done with "negative CALLI's", that is,
system calls whose selector value had bit 18 set; the WAITS operating system at
Stanford AI Lab did the same sort of thing to a v. 3 monitor.

In addition to the OS mods, the CIS folks changed the microcode to get a larger
address space (unrelated to KL "extended addressing").

All of this gleaned from the last CIS -10 guy nearly 6 years ago.

Does it actually show the keyboards?

The SAIL keyboard had perhaps the worst key layout ever inflicted upon
mankind (womankind too, although other than the poor secretaries there
weren't many of the distaff gender there).  The Knight keyboards were much
better, although they too were massive in size (guarantee of carpal-tunnel
syndrome).

That may be true, but I never heard either phrase at MIT-AI or at SAIL.

> But I don't recall specifically from whom I learned it.

It's possible that the individuals who used it left by the time I appeared
at MIT-AI (c. 1974-75) and SAIL (c. 1977).  Or maybe you heard it at
IRCAM, maybe from Andy Moorer?

I remember being very surprised when I read the entry for cokebottle
shortly after you added it to the jargon file in 1978 or thereabouts. That
was the first time I had ever heard it.  I don't remember hearing you use
it either.

There's DECUS # 10-9, Music System for the PDP-10, Version: 1,
November 1969.  See

In

http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/www/lib10/0011/MBLURB.TXT

there is a very brief mention that

  (NOTE: For simple, quick-and dirty listening, placing a
  transistor radio near the MI, or near Bay 2 of the KA10
  will produce the music, but hardly in Hi Fi.)

but the preferred way to play music is the MK10 "Music Kludge" :-).

We built the MK10 (subsequently donated to Max Burnett's museum) and
some of our programmers entered new music into it. The MK10 plugged into
the console lamps, and mixed the music from six voices down to stereo,
which we then recorded onto tape. I'm sure that the cassette is on my
desk here *somewhere*...

A branch, as opposed to a jump, is a transfer of program control to a
location relative to the currect PC or to a base register.  A jump, on the
other hand, is a transfer to an absolute address.

Branches are commonly seen in byte-oriented machines with variable length
instructions, since the resulting instruction can often be quite small,
e.g. 2 bytes.  To do a transfer to an absolute address, you have to do an
indirect.  This was usually alright since most transfers were to nearby
locations.

On some machines, e.g. S/360, this was an essential feature since a
register was used to store your base address.  Consequently all memory
references had to be relative to this base register.  I forget the
complete details -- it has been nearly 30 years and it was a painful
memory that I have tried to erase.

Jumps on the PDP-8 were actually closer to branches than jumps, but not
quite.  They were something in between.

There were quite a few things on the PDP-10 that would be considered
"wasteful" by the byte oriented world, not the least being that all
instructions were the same length and same format.  Then too, the PDP-10
has a JUMP instruction that does not jump, and a SKIP instruction that
does not skip... :-)

Yet these were the same attributes that made the PDP-10 a delight to
program on; one of the few architectures in history (including the PDP-8
and the PDP-15) in which one *wanted* to program in assembly language on
because it was such a pleasure.

:-)  But the first two sentences of Glen's paragraph are still right for
indexing too.  Neither the 360 nor most RISC's let 0 work for indexing.  BK
uses VAXen so he wants to use R0 for indexing too.  But he doesn't seem to
think that having some registers that disappear out from under you (R0-R5
on a MOVC5, e.g.) or having registers that work differently from all the
others (AP,FP,SP,PC) is inconsistent.  :-(  Bob, when was the last time you
used PC as an index register for anything other than an instruction?

Really two forms, the SOJx that did the counting and the AOBJN that did the
counting and provided an index value too.

As far as I know, Stanford had only one PDP-6, and it was

After the KA10 was installed we ran a two-CPU system 
(KA10 and 166, with the 166 operating as a slave)
and I think the memory was increased after that,

The MIT AI Lab PDP-6 had a full moby (Fabritek), an unheard-of thing at
the time.  I don't know if Stanford's PDP-6 ever did; at the time I was
there (starting in 1977) it only had the original 64K memory box.

The 162 (a.k.a. fast ACs) was still there in 1977 when I started work at
SAIL, but the 163s were gone, replaced with this big honking box that held
all of 64K.

The story I was told, twice, once by a ex Tops developer, and once by
someone from DEC oz, was that <site> had expanded the memory on their
6.  It was booted, and nothing happened. Dead as a maggo. Then the
penny dropped, it was sizing memory, and waiting for the NXM as it
counted up :) I thought it was Stanford.

1969, and I don't recall it happening.  At the time
I left we still had the 166, but the system was no
longer a PDP-6, strictly speaking, because it also
had a KA10 processor.  Perhaps the system was later
split up, and 256KW of memory was put on the 166?

What's a maggo?

In regards to an e-mail about possible myth of the PDP-10 clone at Xerox:

That story is the topic of Chapter 7 "The Clone" in "Dealers of Lightning,
XEROX PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age" by Michael Hiltzik
(ISBN 0-88730-891-0).

	"The talk," Kay said, "turned into how long it would take
	us to _build_ our own PDP-10."  The answer was about one year
	and less than $1 million.  The truth was that Xerox had only
	forbidden the lab to buy a PDP-10.  Nobody had said
	anything about cloning one.

It was called the MAXC (Multiple Access Xerox Computer) and had to be
bug-for-bug compatible with the PDP-10's floating point instructions
in order to run LISP.

MAXC and MAXC II are pretty well documented. There was an article
in IEEE computer about MAXC (May 1978 pp 57-67) and I have scans
of some information on it at www.spies.com/aek/pdf/xerox

Something I had wondered about was HOW they got it done so quickly.

I suspect it had a lot to do with Thacker, et al 's experience at
Berkeley Computer Corporation building the BCC-500. They knew how
to build microcoded machines, having just built that one, and they
also decided to use the then new semiconductor RAM devices rather
than go through the pain they went through with the flakey core
memory system they bought for the BCC.

I'm less familiar with the BBN people who came over to PARC at
the same time that worked on MAXC (Fiala in particular) but I'm
sure they must have been as sharp as the folks who came over
from BCC.

Actually, wrong!  It turns out that at least three

integrated circuits!  I was quite surprised.  
The module types are....

John Sauter responded:

When I noticed that some of these traditionally discrete
modules were built with integrated circuits, I asked
someone from DEC.  I don't remember who it was, but
the answer I got was that DEC had no prejudice about
discrete versus integrated.  They would use whatever
was less expensive, and were happy to switch from one
to the other as prices changed.

Actually, Zork was first written on a -10 in a lisp-like
language called MDL (pronounced "muddle"). A "rather
paranoid DEC engineer" re-wrote it in FORTRAN...and that
was DUNGEON. Later, the Zork folks at MIT formed a company
called Infocom (and Licklider sat on the board of directors).
They wrote an interpreter and created data files...and split
Zork into *three* pieces.

Even the PDP-10 MDL version was for a while called DUNGEON, then it
reverted to ZORK.  So it wasn't only the FORTRAN version that was
called DUNGEON.

So it was ADVENT -> ZORK -> DUNGEO -> ZORK, is that correct?

There's no direct relation between ADVENT and ZORK, except to the extent
that ZORK was inspired by ADVENT.  My understanding of the evolution
of the code is:


  ZORK (MDL) ---> DUNGEON (MDL) ----> ZORK (MDL) ------> ZORK I (ZIL)
  ("Mainframe \   (name change)       (name changed   (commercial product
    ZORK")     \                       back)             from Infocom)
                \
                 \
                  --> DUNGEON (FORTRAN) ----> DUNGEON (C)
                      (translated by an       (translated by
                      engineer at DEC, and    f2c and fixed
                      released to DECUS)      up by hand)


Most of the parts of ZORK that didn't make it into ZORK I were later used
in Zork II and Zork III, along with new material such as the Wizard of
Frobozz.

There was a series of three "History of Zork" articles by Tim Anderson and
Stu Galley in the New Zork Times volume 4 (1985), describing all of this
in considerably more detail.  PDF files of these issues can be found in
the Interctive Fiction Archive:

How soon we forget! Barb, don't you recall that most of us in the
monitor group had our own private development monitors, particularly
when we were developing and debugging major new features. Two that I
was responsible for come immediately to mind, extended RIBs and
MTXSER. In each of those cases I built multiple private versions in
order to debug. Only after I was satisfied I had a working version did
I submit my changes so they could be SOUPed into the "black" versions.

And yes, I remember the COMMON split (into COMMON, COMMOD, and
COMDEV). IIRC I was one of the few people who understood the
"spaghetti" macros well enough to mess around with them. Of course TH
was one of the others.  :-)

I know I've forgotten a lot, but not in this case :-).  More later.

Right.  My point was that, for every MTXSER source edit, you 
did _not_ recompile S, F, and COMMON (unless their sources changed
and you wanted to do a clean build).  The usual procedure to 
verify your patches got into source code was to recompile MTXSER,
merge MTXSER.REL into TOPS10.REL (I don't recall what the naming
convention of the REL was way back then) and pull it through 
LOADER.  If COMMON had to be recompiled everytime we compiled
a foo.MAC, you would have had Tape Prep on strike :-). 

One of the reasons the COMMON split was a mess was nobody
could compile their edits of the other sources.  That 
split should have been an exclusive edit allowing the normal
weekly edits to use the "old" COMMON.  But it got me a rose
ala a memo from Rich Krasin.  :-).  However, if Hastings had
a lash for every swear I breathed during that edit (and I was
a lady back then ;-), he would still have welts today.

Where were you when I was doing the edit?  It was one of my
more memorably frustrating work days.  I tried my damnedest
to get done with that edit.  Alan finally made me quit at
22:00 that night.  It was the first time in my life that I had
ever met a macro; I couldn't make sense out of any of them.

It was the spookiest edit I think I ever did.  Mention of
COMMON, macroes, and error caused people to go Poof! and
disappear that day.  <GRIN>

Yup.  

I got a question.  I've got a magtape that says its a full
save of TW's BADP: when it was an RP04.  You probably know
more about what was going on at that time (IIRC, you were
hanging around smelling of smoke at that time ;-)).  Is
it useful to try to restore it?

Yeah, I'd agree with that.  PA1050 (documentation? RTSL! :) was written
to support standard DEC-supplied 10 software like the COBOL compiler and
such; until native 20 versions could be produced, if ever.  Exotic stuff
like shared writeable hiseg was surplus to requirements.  If Harris's
version of DECWAR worked multiuser, either it was rewritten for TOPS-20
(in which case it should still work in the right setup), or it relied on
a bespoke PA1050 -- implementation of SETUWP etc.

CMU-10A and CMU-10B definitely ran TOPS-10, albeit hacked for their
style of PPNs.  CMU-20C ran TOPS-20.

The PPN stuff was the least of the changes.  ARPAnet support obviously
(most from Harvard, some from me), lots of audio I/O for the speech
recognition group (include Ampex 8? channel studio tape deck control),
lotsa scheduling work for real time, IBM 2741 support (what a waste of
time and effort - Harvard's output only support made a lot more
sense), III video camera (not much used).

We also had some interesting hardware that didn't require much code -
RCA's prototype memory (64K and fast, but Really Crappy Apparatus),
Ampex core memory, Ampex disk drives, early silicon memory (I forget
by whom, but 1024 bit chips).

I left in 1974, well before CMU-20C showed up, so there may be lots I'm
missing, but by then most special hardware work was being done on PDP-11s.

Strange; Stevens Tech's KA10 system also had 2741 support.  I thought that
it was supplied by DEC.  Since most PDP-10 software was full-duplex by
nature and didn't have a clue about unlocking keyboards, you had to use
the ATTN key every time you wanted to enter a line...

My contact with CMU's systems started in '76; at least that's when I
remember being assigned MC0R as my "man number".  At the time, I thought
that CMU looked fairly vanilla, at least compared to SAIL.

IIRC, DEC provided 2741 support only via ANF-10.  Somewhere I still
have my APL "golf ball" from working on 2741/APL bugs in the ANF code.
I think it was a "931" font ball.  I only started playing with the
code in 1976 or so, and I never heard exactly where it came from.  I
had assumed that Bob South had done a lot of it.

I don't remember TOPS-10 having anything from DEC for 2741 support
directly from the DC76 or older serial devices, and I had seriously
hacked on the DC76 code for various reasons from time to time.

This would have been in X680I (PDP-8/I front end to a KA).

The C-MU code (not mine, btw) was kinda cute.  When the program would
go into input wait, the keyboard would be unlocked.  If something
outputs to the TTY, that couldn't print until you hit return or hit ATTN.
The latter locked the keyboard, the system would print any text it
had, then release the keyboard again.

On the other hand, if the 2741 didn't have to print but the program
wasn't waiting for input, the keyboard would stay locked.  Hitting
ATTN would toggle the keyboard lock it so you could type ^C (two
letters - not control key!)

There's a reference in another post to DEC providing 2741 support in
ANF-10 in 1976.  I was there - I don't remember that at all.  However,
it wouldn't be the first part of ANF-10 I've suppressed.  I had
_completely_ forgotten about working on the first pass of the DECnet
compatible port, but was brought back from people who were at the
meeting in Chicago where I talked about it.  Damn them!  :-)

I was at C-MU 1968-1974 (last two years fulltime TOPS-10 wizard) and
DEC 1974-1978.  Th system looked pretty much standard TOPS-10, except
for the man number stuff, most of the differences were extensions to
the stock system.  That reminds me of one change I deleted - when DEC
came out with printer spooling, I removed all our pages of LPT
intercept code and replaced it with a dozen lines or so to make DEC's
code act like ours.

Sail gave up keeping up with DEC's code ages before.

Is there any chance some of the software from these machines (say, a

There's a copy of TOPS-20 Common Lisp on Lingling.

.FLAME ON

As the one person who can probably claim to be the first person in all
of DEC to work on TCP/IP, I certainly have some empathy.

DEC, mostly the folks in the mill, ML5-5 and ML3-2, were so into the
NIH attitude, that it really hurt DEC for a long time, and in ways
those folks never understood.  

For example, VMS could not allow command completion because it was
invented elsewhere, and DCL was a "Pure" interface.  If used, it might
waste a few precious CPU cycles.  (The actual reason given for not
allowing it.)  Never mind what would help the user.

DECnet couldn't use link state routing, like other networks, including
ANF-10, because they didn't come up with the idea first.  Later, as
the net became larger, they "found" the problems everyone else had
gone past, invented a number of hacks to work around the problems.

Bill Johnson once threw me out of his office because I told him the
politically incorrect thing:  "The customer wants TCP, not DECnet."
There had just been a huge fight inside DEC at that point, and the
DECnet bigots had won, pushing the company to limit much, if any
spending on TCP development. (Funding was limited.)  DEC has spent so
much money on DECnet that they could not admit that while TCP was
better in some respects, worse in others, it provided things our
customers really wanted, like running on many different platforms.

DECnet also suffered from some immensely huge mistakes, like one
address per node (rather than one address per interface) and the huge
hack of mucking with the MAC address to include the node number.

ANF had the address issue as well, but never was deployed in networks
large enough to have it be a problem.  The largest ANF network I ever
saw was about 120 nodes.  There were too many dependencies on TOPS-10
and all the utilities and programs ever done for the -10 to go much
past that limit. (Devices, like line printers, were limited to nodes
with  addresses 1-63.)

This is an incredible understatement.

I would use terms such as "mortal wound that ultimately killed DEC."

I remember this quite well.  It was when I heard this that I wrote off VMS
forever.

That's almost as good as the story Tony Wachs told about being thrown out
of an office at Wang when he said he wanted TECO...

By the way, where did you go after you left DEC?

Whenever I think about "DEC and networking", I always think of a certain
woman who once worked at DEC.  You know that really obnoxious nerd-girl in
the TV show "Malcolm in the Middle", with the big nose and screechy voice?
She reminds me of this DEC employee.

I remember her flaming on about how DEC and OSI were going to take over
the world and that all this TCP/IP stuff was crap.  And that they didn't
need to hear from anybody else because they knew better how to network.

The DEC corporate attitude and the OSI attitude went hand in hand.  I
remember all too well the dark days of the mid-1980s when we were
compelled to kiss OSI posterior for political correctness.

The TOPS-10 people had their hearts in the right place, but they never did
ARPAnet, much less TCP/IP.  NCP and TCP support in TOPS-10 was done by
customers and, as far as I know, was never used by DEC.

ARPAnet was a fundamental part of Tenex, and the first version of TOPS-20
had it stripped out, only to require effort to put it back in.  DEC
treated ARPAnet (and later TCP/IP) as a separate "TOPS-20AN"  that they
didn't really support but charged extra for.

They really didn't get it.

crucial to the product's success.  Even though I

I didn't know anything about network politics, but it

admitted to having IBM equipment.  I then called them
and asked them what they wanted in a communications
product.  It occurred to me at the time that there
must be some marketing department somewhere in DEC

The IBM 2780 had a neat console: it made me think I

I can't answer about the -20 builds.  I can talk a little about the
-10 with the caveat that my work dealt with doing things in such
an order so that what we put on those tapes could be BINCOMed
with no difference when the customers rebuilt the contents of those
tapes.  Our shop also limited the number of batch jobs running. 

So, with all those caveats, I had the process of building all CUSPs,
and unsupported CUSPs down to 8 hours (from DEPEN0.CTL to 
LOGOUT of the final build) before the files could
be laid out for BACKUP.  Note that this included a human checking
each cusp.LOG file for success.

DEPEN0.CTL was the first control file that would start the
dependency builds.  It submitted stuff and then DEPEN1.CTL

IIRC, my DEPEN?.CTL went from 0-4.

Heh.  I bet they had a /COMPILE switch on every line whether
it needed it or not.

If you recompiled everything, it could have taken many hours.
Again that depended on how many batch jobs could run at
the same.  There was maximum job limit (ours was usually 3).

The longest compiles were S, F, COMMON, COMMOD, COMDEV.
Those babies were load with macros, each were expanded based
on the answers made to running MONGEN.  Note that these
had to be compiled successfully before anything else could
be compiled.  Most of the other monitor modules took a 
couple minutes of wall-clock time.  Our weekly monitor
build procedures routines built 12-14 monitors (perhaps
more).  They were usually done by 17:00 iff the edit was
done early.  The edit usually started at 8:30 or so.

Yep, pretty amazing. Hard to believe it could do all that bit banging
and still have time left over to do anything else. I was kind of
surprised, and I wrote the bit banging software for TSS/8.

For completeness, TSS/8 was written by Don Witcraft and me. I wrote
the disk service routine and file system (called the File Phantom, or
just FIP), the swapper, and the terminal service (with 680i support).
Don wrote the command decoder, scheduler, and system initiation
(start-up) routine.

> By the time the 8086 was out, 64K was clearly too small.

Note that the unextended PDP-10 address space was effectively 1MB
(depending how you look at it, it was actually 1 1/8MB to 1 1/4MB), and it
was considered too small back in the 1970s.

By the way, the extended PDP-10 architecture defined a 30-bit address
space; this was equivalent to a 32-bit address space on a byte-oriented
machine.  However, DEC only ever implemented it to 23-bits virtual and
22-bits physical.

XKL finally implemented the full 30-bits.  My understanding was that it
was fairly straightforward to push things to 27-bits (instead of a 32 word
section table, have a whole page for section table), but that the last 3
bits were a major hassle since the KL10 page pointers only allowed for 18
bit page numbers.

The reason why the PDP-10 ended up with a 30-bit address space was the
expectation that for most purposes, 4GB was good enough (and the continued
viability of 32-bit processors today seems to bear that out), and they
wanted to leave space in pointers for index register and indirect.

Certain individuals in the VAX community seized on the "30" number and
claimed that "even after you fix the address space, the PDP-10 still has
less than a VAX."  This is, of course, false, since this was words and not
bytes.  But it didn't stop them from claiming it.

I wonder if the VAX ever fixed the ridiculously small page size that it
had.  As I recall, a VAX page was a mere 512 bytes!

This always seemed obvious to me.  More specifically, the VAX instruction
set always looked to me like a PDP-11 assembly language programmer's idea
of what a compiler writer would want.  I've heard that much of the VAX
instruction set was never used by compilers.

The PDP-10 instruction set, on the other hand, was an assembly language
programmer's idea of what an assembly language programmer would want! ;-)

ELIZA was originally written by Joe Weizenbaum as a MAD 
program that ran on MIT's CTSS in the mid 1960s. Joe had 
created a set of "list processing" routines for FORTRAN 
called SLIP, Symmetric List Processing, and ported them to 
MAD when he came to MIT.  His book "Computer Power and 
Human Reason" talks a little about the serious purpose of 
the program.

I think ELIZA was next ported to LISP, still in the 60s. A 
descendant of that version is built into Gnu Emacs.

Barb:

Don and I debugged TSS/8 on an 8 in the machine area of 12-1, but I
believe that was before you joined DEC; best guess, 1968. Soon after
TSS/8 was into "production" and running at the first two commercial
installations (Lexington High School and Northern Arizona University)
Don left the company and I went to work on the PDP-10. Nathan
Teicholtz (sp?) and Arundati Badrinath took over support of TSS/8.

BTW, my first PDP-10 project was the Real-Time Monitor. I was project
leader and shared an office with one of the other guys on the project
named Jim Flemming.

I would echo that, but to belabor the obvious, the machine was also
specifically designed to make higher-level languages easy to compile.
Design input for the PDP-6/-10 came from Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy and
Peter Sampson.  The curious can read:

TOPS-10's first DECnet ship went on the MCB whateverthehell that
was in hardware.  It's second DECnet ship provided the option of
dropping that crap (IMO just because I had to build it before
putting it on the very expensive tape) and putting DECnet on the
ethernet.  Ethernet implementations made DECnet usable and bootable
(again, my opinion based on the fact that I had to certify it).
I never certified DECnet through the DN87.  That hardware ran
stuff that could run without a gazillion instructions/character
stroke (again, only my uneducated opinion).

The work that should be done, if anything gets done, is to do the
unfinished project of making the KS an end node (this is TOPS-10).
Bill didn't have time to do it in 7.03; after that, idiots took
over and office politics became more important.  It was on my list
of things to put in the project plan for 7.05 (the real 7.05 and 
not the maintenance release that got shipped under that name).

The DN87 did ANF, not DECnet.  May you rot in hell for implying that
ANF-10 used DECnet.  There was a DECnet Phase 2 "compatibility port"
module for it, but it was very limited in what it did, since DECnet,
at that time, was far, far behind what ANF could do.

The software that ran in the ANF systems was, by and large, the same,
the only difference being what types of devices were installed as
options.

DN80, 81, and 82 were 11/40's, 1 or more DQ-11's.

IIRC, the 81 was a card reader and line printer, the 80 had DH-11's,
and the 82 had both.  It was a "remote" system.  HOSS, for example had
a DN82 connected to one of the DN87's on 1026, via a 19.2 short haul
modem.

Th 85 and 87 both were connected to a DL-10, the 85 was optioned with
DQ-11's, the DN87 with up to 8 DH-11's.  In reality, many DN87's had
both DQ's and DH's.  The only hardware difference between the DN87 and
the DC76 was you could find a DN87 with DQ's while you wouldn't on a
DC76.  Same hardware, completely different software.  Same as the
DN6x.  Same hardware, different software.

The 87s was like the 87, but used the DTE rather than the DL-10. It
did not support "master DTE" functions, e.g. it could not margin
power, load microcode, step the KL cpu, etc.

To build a DN87s with card reader and line printer support was
trivial.

The DN2xx systems were 11/34 based, and developed because the 11/40
had been end-of-lifed.  "Development" was somewhat trivial, IIRC, the
only thing being to add some code to CHK-11 to check for and report
the CPU type correctly.

It was possible, and even easy, to build a DN87 with DZ's and DH's, as
well as mixed Sync lines of various types.

I was one of the people who helped on that project, and was logged in when
it was shut down for the last time.  [I did ensure that its final email
message was delivered.]

To the best of my knowledge, all SIMTEL20 backup tapes were destroyed.
There were some truly nasty politics going on at the time.

The only data from SIMTEL20 that was saved was the data that people had
the foresight to FTP from that system before it was shut down.  Keith
Peterson saved the public domain software archive, and moved it to
hardware under his control where it remains available today.  I saved most
of my TOPS-20 work since it was cloned on my 2020, but it appears that the
SIMTEL20 ACJ is lost.

If a SIMTEL20 backup tape were to be located, it would be possible to
bring up a full SIMTEL20 clone that would be better (faster, more
reliable) than the original SIMTEL20 was.

8-bit addressing on the ARPAnet was obsolete by 1978-9.  I wrote the first
PDP-10 32-bit addressing NCP (at the Stanford AI Lab system) in 1977.

With 32-bit addressing, ARPAnet theoretically could address 24 bits in the
low-order three octets (the high order octet was always 10 decimal; later
on there was a second ARPAnet, called Milnet, using high order octet of 26
decimal).  The second octet was the port number on the IMP; the third
octet was the logical host number (the IMP didn't care); and the low-order
octet was the IMP number.

This, 10.3.0.11 translated into "port 3 on IMP 11", which was the DEC-20
for which I was the system programmer for many years.  10.3.1.11 would go
to the same machine, and was handled by the DEC-20.

So, discounting the logical host octet, let's look at how much ARPAnet
ended up routing.  A 1988 host table shows IMP host numbers up to 11, and
IMP numbers of up to 126, in use.  This indicates 11, maybe 12, bits of
addressing.  So ARPAnet was able to handle as many as 2047 or possibly
4095 nodes.

Of course, by this time, TCP/IP was well-established, and was routing
quite a bit more.

The PDP-6 monitor. Roots of the PDP-6 monitor go back to 
software written for 18 bit DEC computers like the PDP-1,
and even earlier machines that were built at MIT.

TOPS-10 was a later name for the entire system of which
the Monitor was a part.

TOPS-20 was another operating system sold on later versions 
of the PDP-10, and was derived from a BBN operating system 
called TENEX.

DECnet was unimportant, and is on the (well-deserved) rubbish bin of
history.  TCP/IP was what was important, and is what is important today;
and DEC persistantly treated it as second-class.

Ethernet for the PDP-10 had already been solved (MEIS).  DEC could have
bought the rights easily.  DEC's doing the NI was simply "not invented
here" disease.

CI was a good idea, although it represented a technological dead end since
that is not how loosely-coupled clusters were done.

VMS is on the well-deserved rubbish bin of history.  Once again, DEC
picked the wrong horse.  The resources wasted on VMS should have been
placed on UNIX.

Ditto Alpha, DEC's last pathetic attempt to impose a proprietary
architecture on the world.  By that time DEC had forgotten how to program,
as its advanced filesystem for OSF/1 turned out to be such a disaster that
people started abandoning it in droves.

DEC is a mere memory today.  DEC persistantly picked the wrong horses,
and equally persistantly alienated its loyal customer base.

This is the good DEC that many of us remember, not the evil Digital that
we wish we could forget.

The Internet revolution was not sudden; it was brewing throughout the
1970s and 1970s.  Digital had every opportunity to ride the wave, and blew
it.

DEC also blew the personal computer revolution.  Remember DEC's pathetic
entries?  The Rainbow (which, as I recall, was *monochrome*), which didn't
give the Z80 side access to the status of the communications port?  The
DEC Professional, and it's...uh...unique P/OS operating system?

VAX/VMS.

The initial diagnostics were compiled by MACRO-32, by defining
a great pile of macros, which were, in fact, derived from the macros which
were used by MACRO-32 to compile the initial diagnostics for PRISM.

I'm almost positive GEM was built on VAX/VMS as well.

The only ports which use Telnet option negotiation are Telnet (23) and FTP
(21).

Good Telnet clients, such as the TOPS-20 implementation, are happy to
accept option negotiation from servers at other ports if the server
unilaterally starts doing it, but will not initiate option negotiation on
its own.

I agree with the prior posts that emulation makes a native port
unnecessary.

But if someone wanted to port TOPS20 (to a 64b system), a rewrite is
not necessary.  Macro-10 can be treated as a 'higher level language'
generating inline code or, for complex instructions, subroutine calls.
This was the approach taken to port VMS, another operating system
written substantially in assembly language.  The macro compiler starts
out very naive -- essentially doing 1:1 translation of instructions --
and then applies standard and OS-specific optimization techniques to
knock out unnecessary emulation steps, e.g., if an ADD is immediately
followed by a MOVN, there's no need to set the flags correctly on the
ADD.  See the papers in the Alpha issue of the DEC Technical Journal
for information on the Macro compiler (and the binary translator,
VEST, which allowed rapid porting of layered products).

By sheer coincidence, assuming 8 bytes are used to hold a 64b word,
the 10's 512W page corresponds to the 4KB pages supported on most
modern microprocessors.  Thus, one of the great problems in the VMS
port (the change in page size) would be less troublesome.  Of course,
the I/O subsystems would have to be rewritten from scratch.

Alpha's only advantage, vis a vis other RISC architectures, would have
been the flexibility of the PALcode structure to present a priviliged
architecture that was very "10 like".  Alpha presented different
privileged "faces" to VMS, Unix, and NT, to minimize the rewrites
along the OS/hardware borders.  But it's all moot now.

   A _Computers and Automation_ computer census of January,
1970 lists first installation of a PDP-6 in 10/64.  -10s
first installed 12/67.

   First System 360 installed was the 360/40 in 4/65.  By
1970 there were 1758 360/40 installations worldwide.

Jupiter (nee Hephastus) or KC10 (c for 100K ECL) was an instantiation of 
the PDP10 instruction set using 100K ecl components and a series of 
microcoded machines.  It was approved to support 30 bit addressing (CE 
or if you prefer CGB would not allow 32 bit addressing).
Venus was the next gen high end vax.  I don't recall which number it 
turned into 8xxx or soemthing.  I know Al helenius and Trygve Fossum 
wore working on it.

At the time, the differences between a variable lenght instruction and a 
fixed length instruction allowed us to project a much faster machine on 
the 10 side than the vax side.

I gues that CGB is Gordon Bell, but who was CE?

Venus was the VAX 8600. I believe they had to downgrade the
speed to get it out at all (and it was pretty late
by then). When they eventually managed to up the speed,
the result came out as the VAX 8650 (aka Morningstar).
There was a rumour of a VAX 8670, but I have no idea
if it was ever more than a rumour.

Shortly before the cancellation, the 2080 had been renumbered as the 4050;
I have a marketing materials binder with the DECSYSTEM-4050 name right there
on the front for all to see.

Grump.  I never thought to scan it till just now; have to wait till I can get
it out of the storage locker.

I was one of those. I saw to it that a number of large institutions never
went with Digital. You see, a well-argued "don't do" will have a lot of impact
when there are lots of alternatives. 

I know there were tens of others like me just in Scandinavia.

And, given the failure, the method they went about it was the most
inexcusable. If they had gotten together a "save the day" kit with
e.g. System Concepts and a 10 year migration plan this would have worked.
We knew the '20 was in a lot of trouble already, and a "soft way out"
would have been sellable.

Dumping it cold turkey did not.

You alienated a lot of powerful people. By act of coincidence, I have
heard lamenting "i miss the old 20" sighs from at least 3 people that have
later held cabinet posts.

>Don't confuse short-term results with long-term results.

The results were pretty immediate for our part. In 1986 the old Tops20 hands
I knew ran Prime, ND, QNX or various unices. We all knew these were stopgap
measures (Prime and ND did not, and had delusions of grandeaur) in the wait
for a non-butchered unix. Really usable unix systems arrived 3-5 years later.

My search above only displayed serials 102x.  The list I have contains
over 30 KL systems with serials below 1100.

2476

I thought it was also the ARPAnet TOPS-20 development system as well,
but recently someone here with a knowledge of where the various cards
and options were installed said they doubted that a 1091 could have
BOTH an external memory controller (DMA20) *AND* a KI10 I/O bus
adaptor (DIA20) which would have been required to talk to the IMP
interface...

Do you mean PDP-10 I/O bus (TD10) connected DECtapes?
Of _course_ they had them on their front ends!

	Anything with a serial number below 2100 (or so) was
	manufactured as a 1090 (or 1080), in bright blue "high boy"
	(rack height) cabinets, with "external" core memory that had
	multiple ports, and could be used for SMP.

	The higher range were either 2040/2050/2060's (orange) or
	1091's (a paler blue), in "corporate" (VAX height) cabinets,
	with "internal" semiconductor (MOS DRAM) memory.

	2065's (and 1095) were manufactured in the FCC RFI safe boxes
	(designed for Jupiter) were any of the FCC cabinets blue??

Here is a complete list of all the 10's at DEC Marlboro in the 80's;

 514	TOPS-10 Development		DEC, Marlboro		KI10
 546	TOPS-10 Development		DEC, Marlboro		KI10

I remember the Venus (8600) project had some 2060's they used for
development (wrote code to handle net lists in extended addressing
FORTRAN), but they don't seem to appear on the list (it's possible
they were absorbed by 36-bit engineering, and DO appear). The Jupiter
microcode people had a system "IO - One of Jupiters Moons" -- I
suppose that could have been #2530...

On the topic of low serial number KL's, here are two other famous systems:

The hardware groups may have still been under 36-bit engineering
at the _startup_ of Venus.  The hardware part of 36-bits all
got transferred to non-36-bit enginnering soon after the
demise of Jupiter.  People had already started moving over
to (what we used to think of as) Central Engineering before
Jupiter was cancelled.

Then the message wasn't shipped with Level D.  IIRC, the monitor
was shuffling before Level D.

The Level D spec was another one of the docs that was on BLKC
and is probably gone.  IIRC, this spec had been put into the
Notebooks very early on.  But I don't remember if or when it
was removed.

Did it come from COMPIL or from the monitor?

The comment about the error message was in uppercase due
to the console being a TTY33 was technically incorrect.  
They were uppercase because nothing printed lower case,
line printers or terminals.  I'm not saying a flavor didn't
exist, I'm saying it wasn't standard equipment on a -10 and
people didn't spend money for lower case back then.

Level D got installed at our site when we were running 4S72.
I can't remember if we ran 4S72 after it got installed; I
don't recall running a 5-level monitor version (but I didn't
a damned thing about versions at that time:-).

With the cross-posted thread on PDP-11 O/S release dates still around
I was inspired to update some of my lists which can be found at
http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/index.html#lists
including:

TOPS-10 release dates;
	http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/tops-10

	Using the UUOSYM revision history as a guide, I added more
	solid dates.  I also added the version number of UUOSYM
	released with each monitor.

	Sadly, some conventions (upping the UUOSYM major version
	number with each major O/S release, and upping the minor
	version for each minor O/S release, and keeping a detailed
	revision history in the source) were not continued after 7.03
	(post Barb?).  Fortunately, downloading all the copies of
	UUOSYM.MAC I could find on trailing-edge.com I was able to
	track the changes made in the last 4 years.

TOPS-20 Releases;
	http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/tops-20

	This list had been more complete.  I recently added some
	pre-release 1 dates: start of TENEX development, first TENEX
	production, dates of several "KL paging" memos by Dan Murphy.

PDP-6 Serial Numbers;
	http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/pdp6-serials

	Sites for 19 or so of the 23 systems built, includes urls for
	mentions, photos, etc.  Including photos of a dual PDP-6
	installation at Lawrence Livermore Labs!  "Actual" serial
	numbers for only a few systems are known, and even those are
	suspect.

	If any old hands still remember any serials, or if you know of
	any installations not on the list, please let me know.

	If you know of anyone who might know, or know someone who
	might know someone, please pass this message on!

KL & KS Microcode versions;
	http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/kl-ucode
	http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/ks-ucode

	Both are now populated with the revision histories from the
	sources available at trailing-edge!  Much is still missing
	about what versions were released, when, and for/with what
	monitor/hardware releases.

Old Hardware Option "Type" numbers
	http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/types

	Al Kossow and Bob Supnick sent me some new entries
	and new mysteries.

TENEX/TOPS-20 JSYS list;
	http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/pdp6-serials

	new. no information for when various JSYi were added
	in TENEX development, or TOPS-20 development before release 3.

	I haven't found any MONSYM files for 5 series monitors.

The http://www.ultimate.com/phil/pdp10/index.html (Phil's PDP-10
Miscellany) has undergone growth, organization, and expansion.

I've added editorial text (ie. actual content) which may not be the
perfect truth, but which I hope helps provide context for those not
previously steeped in the lore.  The "Other History Links" section has
grown beyond the context of PDP-10s, with many links for predecessor
systems (particularly the TX-0 and PDP-1).

Shit.  And that one (caring for UUOSYM) was even on my formal job
description.  I should have changed UUOSYM to reflect 7.04 [puzzled
emoticon here].  7.04 was about to go into field test when I got
too sick to work.  Part of my routine was to do all of the 
accounting work first thing when we started a new cycle.  I sure
hope the right one got out.

Okay.  IF anybody can find the pack that was in my office, it 
would have contained every edit, every release, and probably quite
a bit more that had to do with the KL microcode.  The guy who
handed it to me for safe(hah!)-keeping said that every revision
(in source form) of the KL microcode was on that pack.  IIRC,
it was an RP06 TOPS-20 pack.

If I know myself, I also would have had that pack BACKedUP and
fire stored.  But whothehell knows what happened to those tapes.

According to what I have found, HAUNT was written in the OPS4
language by John Laird at Carnegie Mellon University around 1980-81.
The original source is missing-in-action. There is a source for
HAUNT in OPS5 (*not* OPS4) on the Interactive-Fiction Archive. It
can be found here:

	<http://www.funet.fi/pub/misc/if-archive/games/source/haunt.ops5.gz>


Some information on this game can be found at:

	< http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/laird/haunt.html>

and

	<http://www.lysator.liu.se/adventure/Mainframe_adventures.html#HAUNT>


There are some OPS5 programming systems around the 'net...you can 
find them by googling...ISTM you are going to need an OPS5 
interpreter to run this source code...

Thanks Barb for such a descriptive analysis that I, immho,
believe quite clearly captures the subtley and essence of
the differences between the applications that are being sold
as operating systems and a real OS.  No, I am not bashing any vendor,
I am recognizing what you have stated here, and many have tried to
articulate - the diffs between an application and an OS.
Well done.

That is something to speculate about!  TOPS-10 and 20 are attempting
to do some rotational and seek optimization on the emulated drives.  I
wonder if that is causing some problems. :-)

I remember speaking with "them" in the hall at the last Decus I went
to where "THEY" would still let "us" (customers) actually approach and 
interact with "them".  We were talking about the HSC-50 controller,
its own optimization strategy, and how it might interact with TOPS-10's
ordering of disk i/o.  Kimo Y stepped up and stated, "Oh it does
de-optimization for us!" :-)

It's rooted in the Sanskrit word for "eight".

The early TCP/IP design documents (predating any international
involvement) ca. 1974 used the word "octet", because the word "byte" 
and "word" did not commonly refer to any particular number of bits.
Where the authors picked up the word "octet" from, who knows.
I don't think "octet" had been used in CCITT documents, though, for example.

The ARPANET specs (eg. NCP) didn't use "bytes" or "octets", 
but rather just measured everything in bits.  Some higher 
level ARPANET protocols had "bytes", but they didn't mean 8 bits; 
you had to specify the byte size.  More often, the phraseology 
was still counting bits, as in: "The code set is a seven-bit 
USASCII in an eight-bit field."
