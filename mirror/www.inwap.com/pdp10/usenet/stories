Once in a blue moon if the crash was due to fumble fingers.
When those guys patched on the fly they usually did a thorough
job.  

I should note that any hardware paths that were unique to
a CPU went down with that CPU.  This included front end
comm lines and remote stations that didn't have a dual path.

Thank the bit gods for Ethernet.

You know, reading this brings a tear to my eye!  I've been playing with toy
computers way to long, and had pretty much forgotten that real computer
systems can do things like this.  Unfortunatly the only system I ever got to
work on that was able to do this was a 4 CPU Honeywell DPS-8 system running
GCOS-8.  The closest I've seen to this in modern Hardware would have to be
a VMS Cluster.

The one with which I had to contend was written in MIDAS, if I remember
correctly.  It was more Unix-like than Tops-20-like, which is surprising
when you think about the implementation language.  Or perhaps not.

The person whose head is right behind Clair Grant and before
Howard Mayberry is Susan Anderson...I think.  She was
a secretary.  I've been trying to remember her married 
name but have drawn a blank so far.

The person whose head is behind Alan's, and sorta next to Phil,
is Carol Perlman, a writer.  

I forgot to print out your list of names and numbers.  My apologies
if you've already got them on the list.

I found the following typed on a 8-1/2x11 paper with sprocket holes
along with a dollar bill.  (It took me years to get people to spell

I've tried to reproduce it as printed, but am unable to smudge the
print quality to spec.

                from:   F. Michael Harris

                date:   17 July 1973



        The contest has been running since 11-June-1973.  Over a hundred
        entries have been received, and the contest will continue until
        further notice.

        The winners (EXPERT SLEUTHS) so far are:


                David Nixon             1107, 1108, 1148        $3.00
                Frank DiPace            1001, 1019, 1149        $3.00
                S. Rabinowitz           1079, 1080, 1083        $3.00
                Nancy Gillis Ohm        1098, 1162              $2.00
                Craig Fletcher          1032                    $1.00
                Don Lewine              1099                    $1.00
                David Rosenberg         1036                    $1.00
                Mary Payne              1064                    $1.00
                Don McKee               1135                    $1.00
                Barbara Huisinger       1205                    $1.00


        The real winner is, of course, FORTRAN-10;  the reliability and
        usability of its forthcoming official release have shown obvious
        improvement as a consequence of this in-house exposure.

        We sincerely thank all contest participants, and urge everyone
        to keep trying!

Has there ever been a port of Unix (or a Unix-like operating system) to
the PDP-10 family of computer systems, /prior/ to the NetBSD/pdp10 port?  
Which, btw, is far from a pipe dream now. The kernel boots to the point of
looking for a filesystem to mount. The last major obstacle to overcome
would appear to be getting ffs to deal with disk sectors that are made up
of 9-bit bytes.

I'm sure once it's finally working, the unholy marriage of NetBSD to the
PDP-10 will cause the heads of various ITS, SAIL, TOPS-10, and TOPS-20
hacker's to explode; assuming, of course, a Unix port hasn't already been
done by someone else.

The design had already run the DEC core diagnostics
for the instructions it implements (AA-AM, CA-CB) which caught a few
errors. Finding the two errors I mentioned would require
a fairly exhaustive diagnostic which ran with paging enabled. There are no
DEC diagnostics which can run with ITS paging enabled, and the
diagnostic I wrote from scratch to take a quick swish around the ITS
executive mode instructions was far from exhaustive.

A group got paid to do this.  The only people in that group
who actually did any useful work didn't stay long.  To 
compensate for the lack of testing out of this group, we found
that the Tuesday builds of the monitor gave the system a
pretty good workout (I can't say that this exercised the
hardware--it sure exercised the montior software).  

We always wanted ORNL for our field test site because they
had a lot of "users" who did all kinds of different things.
I've quoted the users because a lot of them thought they
were using the IBM machines.

That was supposed to be provided with the diagnostics.
Unfortunately, the diagnostic mind set was based on a hardware
p.o.v. and not a software p.o.v. (this is my hypothesis).  The
last guy in charge of the dianostic group did try to add as
many lapses as he could into the diags.  

The problem with diags is that they were targeted at _pieces_
of hardware, not the interaction of different kinds of hardware.

IBM's tape drives would have even less problems.  As I understand they
will go through the whole tape looking for the first block.  If you mount
a blank tape when it is expecting a labeled or unlabeled tape it will run
it off the reel looking for the label.

Then again, I used to hear stories about PDP10 tape drives that had
the ability to do fast forward and rewind at the same time.  You got
your tape back on two reels when it started on only one.  (I knew
someone who this happened to.)

Also, line-printer "music".  "She'll be Comin' Round the Mountian" was one
of the more common ones.  Had to be 'tuned' for the specific printer and
character-set. 

We had a couple of Dataproducts drum printers, with different character-sets.
One had any given character at different rotational positions at each column.
another had a character at the _same_ position at each column.  That latter
one was _really_ noisy, when somebody printed a row of dashes, for example,
to separate sections of a report --- "whing, whing, whing, whing, *BANG*, whing,
whing, whing, whing, *BANG*...."   I kept threatening to do an "1812 Overture"
on that one -- the cannon-fire going to be _easy_!  <grin>

>The sound of a high end tape drive running at full clip.

Continuous start/stop I/O.

And that jet-turbine rewind. particularly as it started up, and/or braked to a 
stop.

>The sound of a Decwriter printing out acct.sys.

Or various status and/or error messages.

a card punch at work, a regular deck         also making 'lace' cards

Some plotters also had 'interesting' sound-effects. Not sure they were 
standard enough to be recognizable, though.


Then there's some of the off-line equipment
  punch-card sorter,
  punch-card 'interpreter',
  decollater (for separating multi-part form stock into separate stacks)
  burster (turned continus-form into a pile of individual sheets)

Or the sounds of paper tape punches; they were real mechanical devices
making real mechanical sounds. Made a real mess if(when!) a paper tape broke.

Attempting this one in any of the installations I have been working at
would just burn a large, fat hole in some major circuit-breakers covering
the entire city block. (did that once). The sound was rather like a loud
bang, followed by *total* silence. 

The startup sounds would be a clatter of sequencing relays, first big
"clank-clack-clack" of the main relays hitting power, and then lots of
minor "clack-dzzzZZRRR" as motors (disks) or fans were
started. Installers were fine-tuning all of this, all the disks needed
to spin up in time for the boot-code not to time out, but without
blowing fuses on the way. In between all of this were cooling and
ventilation units starting. There were separate sequencers attached to
all the major hardware; the trick was to have them be suitably staggered.
A cabinet full of (10) old Fujitsu 770MB Winchester SMD drives took
a three-phase 32A C-type 220V fuse, and that just blew if they all started
without sequencing.

At the Oslo Stock Exchange there were (probably still is) bi-annual
events where the entire shutdown/startup register is exercised, to check
that things really coldstart cleanly.

A powerfail at the same installation also produced spectacular sounds.
First, the non-priority stuff lost power(3/4th of lightning, lots of
monitors; ventilation/heating/cooling), the building took an eerie,
dim half-silence for a minute or so while the diesel engine got
pre-heated; and then it started with a spectacutar roar that shook the
building; and the sequencing stuff started switching in things; with
clicks and flashes as item after item got power back.  The dark
computer monitors came right back where they were, the
terminal/pc/whatever was on UPS power, but non-essential monitors were
not.

Going back to main power did all of this in reverse, as there was a break in
power when building power went off generator back to utility power.   
The power load was simply too great to switch without operating as a
standalone power generation utility, and that requires lots of licenses.

It gets kind of weird building one of those mini-itx systems that actually
can run most of the old trading system code on 2-3 unix systems; and they
can run a day from a single car battery.

At the below URL you will find short sound recordings of an ASR-33

As we get the chance we will add more sounds to this archive.

Groan. Some of us (well at least me!) were writing real cool programs
in the 70's in DEC-10 assembler and (my personal favorite) BLISS-10.

Well I knew you had fairly strong views on Bliss-10, especially the edict
that all DECsystem-10 monitor development should be done in it.

> What kinds of stuff did you do when you used BLISS?

A variety of systems programming tasks including a user mode version of 
SYSDPB, a reimplementation of PIP (more about this below), a BLISS-10
interface to IOLIB, many compiler tools (I was really into compilers)
and general programming tasks.

The reimplementation of PIP (originally known as PAGER but renamed to
TYPER to avoid confusion) came about when we discovered an interesting
bug in the software that accounted for pages printed. It basically just
counted line feeds and form feeds - we just filled out each line with spaces
and removed form feeds and suddenly we didn't have a problem printing 
out large files any more. I can't remember, but I think we had a limit of 
200 pages per month, which was no where near enough!

Looking back, I must have been a real pain as a user!

Not Bliss-10, Bliss36.  And, not only the code, but all monitor
patches.  You generate a BLISS-36 file that can be patched into
the monitor without DDT.  In addition, the -10 groups were not
allowed to have any BLISS-36 sources.  In addition to that, if
we used BLISS-36 for any development, we would not be allowed
to ship our sources.   If we did use BLISS-36 and we found a bug
in the compiler, it was promised that a fix would not be
supplied ever.  

And I'm not even to the point of the viability of programming,
maintaining, and running the fucking stuff.  I'm just talking
about corporate head-wedges getting shoved down our asses.


This has nothing to do with how useful BLISS is.  :-)

As a packager of a few products that did use all flavors of
BLISS, life sucked.  The organization of Bliss tools (if I
can use that term) was horrible.  Not even a developer knew
what files he used when doing a compile of a MAIN.

ROTFLMAO.  Just to make it clear to the peanut gallery, this wasn't
a PIP behaviour; it was a SPROUT count.

Needless to say, the customers wanted to have nothing to do with BLISS-36.
If a program was written in BLISS-36 that essentially meant that it was
unmaintainable.

The common pithy saying was "BLISS is ignorance."

Not all that many people were impressed with BLISS-10 either.  It was
considered to be strictly a DEC/CMU aberration.  Far more people used SAIL
(or even PASCAL) for systems software development than BLISS; at least
programs in these languages were maintainable and you could get compiler
bugs fixed!

Well as I said, I don't ever recall having a problem with the BLISS-10
compiler. Some things were documented poorly in the BLISS-10 manual
but once I gained access to the compiler sources (I just touched the
listings for good luck) things got a lot easier....

We had SAIL at La Trobe as well but I don't think it was installed for
long. We had a printed version of the manual and I remember the famous
"Dry Rot in SAIL compiler" error message. This was one of the few
messages that made sense (we Australians weren't getting much
American culture thrust upon us in those days). Things like
the BLISS-10 compiler taking a punt and the SIX12 BLISS-10 debugger
didn't make much sense then....

Some business associates of mine were impressed enough that they wrote a text
retrieval system using BLISS-10. They had fairly reasonable success selling it
around the world. However, once the Jupiter project was killed and the
-10s/-20s declared obsolete that ledt them without a hardware base to work
with.

And heavily influence by Dijkstra's "Goto Considered Harmful" letter.

Perhaps if a larger marketing budget had been given to BLISS then we'd all be
using it rather than C as a system implementation langauge. The macro processor
features are so much better than those available in C. Isn't it true that there
was a Basic interpreter written entirely in BLISS Macros?

I would love to see a Bliss language front-end for GCC.

This is the line my associates took. They re-wrote their system in Pascal (VAX
PASCAL). This version is still for sale today and ported to loads more
operating systems than VMS/OpenVMS.

One might accuse them of short-sightedness in first choosing 10s/20s as their
operating system base, BLISS as their implementation language, and then
compounding that by choosing PASCAL as the re-implementation language. Doesn't
seem to have affected sales too much.

My associates kept their Bliss skills by hooking their text retrieval system
into Digital's ALL-IN-1. I got my hands dirty then by writing Bliss-32 code to
enhance that integration. Once you got over the dotty-ness it was a nice
language to use. Hence my desire to see Bliss added to GCC.

When you replaced the core memory with IC based memory in a DEC20 the
entire cabinet could become unstable if certain access panels were
swung out due to  the absence of the heavy core memory.. Field Service
engineers told me they had actually heard of machines tipping over in
the early upgrade days before the problem was fixed. I *think* we had
counterweights fitted but it might have just been a large warning

There wasn't an MH20.  You must be thinking of an MH10 core box or the
like.

Some KL10 variants could support external memory boxes (core from DEC,
semiconductor from Ampex and other vendors) using the DMA20 memory
adapter.  This interfaced the KL10 S bus [*] to the KI-style external memory
bus.  All DECsystem-1080 and -1090 systems were supplied this way.  The
DMA20 was optional on the -1091 and -1095.

However, the KL10 variants used in the DECSYSTEM-2040, -2050, -2060, and
-2065 generally had internal memory.  MA20 and MB20 were internal core
memory, and MF20 and MG20 were internal MOS memory.  All of these were
normally mounted inside the KL10.  I'm not sure whether the DMA20 was
a supported option on any of the 20s.

The interface to the MF20 and MG20 MOS memory was the X bus, which had
the same functions and timing as the S bus but at different electrical
levels.  This required different translator modules in the main
processor card cage.

The KL10 cabinets were supposed to have stabilizer feet regardless of
whether they had internal memory.

The DMA20 memory bus adapter consists of the M8560, M8563, and eight
M8558 modules.  Those modules were not normally present in systems
originally manufactured to use internal memory.  In most KL10-based
DECSYSTEM-20 models the backplane doesn't even have slots for them, so
it's not even an option.

I *think* all KL10s had backplane slots for the DIA20/DIB20 adapter for
the KI-style I/O bus (two M8550 and one M8551).  Those were standard on
the 1080 and 1090, and optional on other systems including the 20s.

Two M8519 Memory Bus Translator modules converted the processor's internal
ECL signals to the memory bus, which then went to the DMA20 or MA20/MB20.
For systems with internal MOS memory (MF20/MG20), one or both of the M8519
modules were replaced by M8580 or M8581 X bus translators.

The 5-CPU SMP site at Oakridge had to use the Ampex memory.
And we routinely used two 1090s with a 2060 to run tri-SMP.
The internal memory on the 2060 was disabled for that configuration.
When we REMOVEd the 2060, we could reconfigure it to run either
as a TOPS-20 or a TOPS-10 single processor.

Beginning in the 1970s, and escalating in the 1980s, there was an
aggressive effort to erase all relics of the past of computing and rewrite
history to suit the political correctness of the time.  Entire tape
libraries were ordered destroyed, with prohibitions on any archival
copies.

One of the worst examples of this was at DEC, where VAX jealousy reached
such a fever pitch that almost all record of DEC ever building another
machine than the VAX were annihilated.

But it was elsewhere.  The UNIX world never reached the insanity of VAX
jealousy, but bad things were said and done.

I don't think that today's retrocomputing fans fully appreciate the
tremendous amount of work that was done by the old farts to save what we
have today.  As much as we've lost, it's truly a miracle how much was
saved.

general distribution, but not the DN60 PDP-11 files.  That's probably
another tape that got shitcanned when Release Engineering's office
got cleaned out.

John Sauter responded:

Well, since it was sent to every DN60 customer, it might
still be out there somewhere.  I was quite proud of that bit
of PDP-11 code.  It had a very small real-time kernel,
with tasks and device drivers.  The tasks moved data
between the DTE-20 or DL-10 and the serial line units,
formatting as they went.  The device driver for the DTE-20
was two interlocked state machines, reflecting the
half-duplex nature of the hardware.  I used the fancy
lights on the DL-10 as a load indicator, like the stack
of LEDs on modern digital audio mixers.

Allocating memory from interrupt level was quite
a challenge.  One task was devoted to clearing
deallocated memory and placing it on a list from
which interrupt level could consume it.  The MACY11
assembler helped us count microseconds in the
critical paths.  We took advantage of the double
buffering in the serial line units to let us take a long path
provided that the next received character always
took the short path.  I don't remember the highest
speed we were able to run reliably, but it may have
been 4800 bits per second.  I do remember that
adding the KMC-11 didn't help.

Debugging while sitting between two KL10s without
skins was quite an experience.  If I were doing it today
I would wear hearing protectors.

Right.  At one point we had a 2040 (later upgraded) that
had *two* DN20s: one for DECnet, one for HASP/RJE.

We were also one of the few sites with a DN200.  This was
used to put terminals and a line printer in a "remote" area
(i.e. about a block away), connected (as I recall) with
line drivers and a synchronous null modem at some ridiculously
low speed that seemed perfectly adequate at the time.  This
was in 1977.

Our DN200 was unique in also having an 8-inch diskette
drive.  More about that here:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/dec20.html#kermit

We wound up using the DN200 only for the printer.  There
were better ways to handle the terminals, and the DN200
diskette drive -- removable storage for students -- was
abandoned in favor of Kermit.

Data General once shipped a system after it passed all their diagnostics,
only to receive an angry phone call from the customer.  The machine wouldn't
run Adventure, for some reason.  It turned out there was a problem that the
diagnostics didn't catch.  As a result, DG adopted a policy that no machine
would be shipped until it had passed all the diagnostics AND run
dventure.  --Tracy Kidder, "The Soul of a New Machine".

After the official sources for the Lisp machine software were moved to
Symbolics (long story there...I'm told that it was to stop RMS from making
unilateral changes that broke it), RMS retailiated by disconnecting
Symbolics' microwave link (which was their link to the network).

RMS brags about doing that.

I believe it when I'm told that it was to stop RMS from making unilateral
changes.  RMS had a well-deserved reputation for doing that; he considered
(and as far as I know still considers) it to be his right to edit
anybody's files for any reason.

Another thing that he would do is patch binaries without making the
corresponding change in the source code; that way, he could keep anyone
else from modifying his projects.

He denies it, but people who got the email swear it's true: he said that
he was going to strap dynamite around his body and blow himself up in
front of Symbolics' headquarters.

He denies saying it in email, but admits that he thought about doing it.

The first system I wrote was in Germany where we had a host 11/40
running RT-11 and about ten satellite 11/10s running my RT-11 clone.
Along with a LIGHTS routine I also implemented a SOUND idle loop. 

The only sound that a PDP-11/10 could make was the terminal bell,
which came out as a beep. I found that by suitably timing RESETs I
could cut the beep off at various points and thus modulate the signal.
The result was more like grunts, burps, twits, etc.

Watching and listening to ten of these machines in the dark, with or
without additional substances, was very much a trip to the jungle.

That message was created by Bill Weir, author of the COMPIL
cusps.  He wrote it in reaction to the monitor's unwillingness
to allocate emough memory for a program, even though
enough was available.  The problem, as I understand it,
was that the available memory was not contiguous, which was 
required in those pre-pager days.  Later version of the
monitor were able to shuffle memory around to coalesce
free space.

However, I thought that DEC changed the message to
"Memory available, but not to you."  That's both more
delicate and more informative than Bill's rant.
