The RS232 Spec (note that there is no letter after the number!) to be
able to receive voltage swings of -/+ 25 volts on hte high side and
detect =/-3V so you had a 6 volt band to copensate for noise.  The spec
also said put out upto +/-12V on the high side.  that was great in
transistor and DCD driver times but with ICs, got to be a bit much and
then we had this little problem with slew rate....as you go up in
speed....
The voltages changed a bit by the tiem we got to RS232C, but the receive
spec was still the same, even tho most folks were running max out put
based on +/-12 volt rails.
DEC Comm 11 did a study of cable type, distance and speed.  High
capacitance cable limited speed and distance.
RS423 helped solve a whole raft of problems.....including incompat. with
MIL-STD 188C...
