Sigh!  The proper name for the caret was up-arrow.  The manauls showed
the ESCAPE key as a dollar sign within a circle (the encircling
was all done by hand before the galleys were sent to the printers).  
Likewise, a <cntrl-C> was presented as
an up-arrow C with a circle drawn around it.  Representing keys
that were hit simultaneously in our documentation was always a
bug-a-boo and several artform techniques were tried over the
years.  There were always some people who didn't get it.

MACRO-10 took the character after the up-arrow argument to
define the base of the number.  So, if I wanted to make
sure that the person reading the code understood that a 
number was to be decimal, I would write MOVEI T1,^D10
There were times when it was important to view a number
as decimal rather than octal (which was the default).

Wow, Hacro and Klink, I haven't thought about those in *decades*.

When Dave Nixon wrote Link, he defined all sorts of "new" .rel file block
types, starting at 1000, which were intended to add support for long symbols
and various other advanced features.  Dave documented them in the Link
manual even though they weren't implemented; I answered several inquiries
from compiler writers asking how to get the new block types to work...

So I spent a lot of spare time implementing those new block types, and my
co-conspirator Jim Thomas added some code to Macro to generate them.  But
when I left DEC no real product was using them.  This was also about the
time that Bob Houk and I added extended addressing support to Link and DDT,
also as a midnight project.

During a Link documentation review, I mentioned that none of these 1000+
block types in the documentation were actually implemented.  The
documentation person was horrified, as was product management.  I also got
wind of the idea that long symbols should be ASCII to be compatible with
that new upstart VAX product (the 1000+ block types used SIXBIT).

There was some pressure building to remove the new block types from the
documentation and maybe the code until such time as they were rethought and
really implemented, but it was still there when I left DEC.  I haven't
looked at recent sources so I have no idea what eventually happened.

FORTRAN-20 V10 ultimately depended upon numerous 1000+ series (``new'')
REL blocks in the LINK V5.1 V5.1 maintenance release.

Nothing came of any ASCII symbol plans - but the SIXBIT REL blocks were
used heavily by FORTRAN.

You can download some manuals from:

	<http://www.spies.com/~aek/pdf/dec/pdp10/1973_AsmLangHandbook/>


There are also published books on writing PDP-10 assembler language.
