My Video TECO runs on almost any Unix system you might care to name, plus
VMS. It really needs virtual memory, so I've never ported it to personal
computers. If you want to look at some documentation for it, look at the
following url:

	http://world.std.com/~paulc/teco.html

This document is huge, I have not had the time to break it up into smaller
web pages, so be aware that it will take a little time to load. But if you
look at "1.4. Screen Layout" there is a GIF file showing you what the screen
looks like when you are editing.

Basically, this is a TECO optimized for screen editing, allowing you to edit
multiple files at once, and files can be very large assuming you have the
virtual memory to support that :-)

The main characteristic that sets this editor apart is that you edit in
TECO commands (which echo at the bottom of the screen) and you
simultaneously see the changes to the file. For instance, if you are
editing and you type the letters "h" and "k", you see "hk" echoed at the
bottom of the screen, and you see the contents of the buffer dissappear.
If you rubout the "k", the contents of the buffer re-appear. The level of
undo is unlimited, back to the last double escape (and double escape is
almost never required - I edit for many hours at a time without $$ so that
in theory I can undo back through the entire session). It is not
absolutely faithful to original TECO, so old macros are unlikely to run,
but it is actually based on the DEC TECO manual, so most commands are 100%
faithful. However, whenever it came to being faithful versus working the
way I wanted, I changed it to work the way I wanted. That was the whole
reason I wrote my own TECO in the first place - so I could make it work
the way I wanted! The biggest change is that lines are terminated with a
single <LF> rather than <CR><LF>. This made sense because I was writing
this under unix. I like it that way, but some people may object.

You can split the screen into multiple panes which can point into the same
buffer, or different buffers (look at section 7.10 for an example). "n"
searches cross buffer boundaries, so you can load the entire source of the
unix kernel into the editor, and then a single "n" search will search
through all the files until it finds your string. Q registers are
implemented as normal edit buffers, so you can jump into them and edit the
contents of the Q-registers.

Anyway, if you are interested check out the www page. I plan on putting the
source on the web server in the near future, it's currently available by
anonymous ftp from ftp://ftp.wimsey.com/pub/teco/cantrell-teco
