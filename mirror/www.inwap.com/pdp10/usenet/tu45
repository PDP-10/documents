3T and 3B are two independent vacuum columns (top and bottom), and "=="
signifies the barrier between the two.  5 is the capstan that moved the tape.

When mounting a tape, a few feet are pulled off of (1), placed over 3T,
between the two halves of 4, underneath 5 and 3B, then onto (2).  There
is no tape inside the vacuum at this point.

When the LOAD sequence was started, the supply reel (1) would weakly
attempt to rotate counterclockwise, taking up slack.  The takeup reel (2)
would rotate slowly clockwise.  The voltage being fed into the takeup
reel motor is higher than what is going into the supply reel motor.
The supply reel loses the tug-of-war, and is forced to rotate clockwise
slowly.  About 1 or 2 additional feet of tape are drawn out of the
supply reel before vacuum is established.

During this time, the blowers creating the vacuum get up to speed and
suck the tape into the vacuum columns with a slurping sound.  Once the
tape loops have stabilized inside the vacuum columns, the drive goes
into search-forward-for-BOT mode.

In this mode, the supply reel motor is still making a weak attempt to
rotate counterclockwise, but is overpowered by the capstan moving the
tape forward.  The takeup reel motor is weakly tying to rotate clockwise,
and is succeeding, taking up all the tape that the capstan is pushing
at it.  The tape moves quickly forward until BOT is reached.

As you can imagine, this battle of weakly attempting to rotate one way
while being forced to rotate the opposite direction by the other reel
is something that has to be properly adjusted.  IIRC there are 6
potentiometers on the TU45 that have to be adjusted.

Daniel,
  Just before pressing the LOAD button, is the tape taut?
  Do the two reels rotate the right direction before vacuum is established?

Here's what I did when loading a TU45:
  Put tape on supply reel.
  Unwind tape until the end was 2 inches off of the floor.
  Put the tape over the top vacuum column, between the heads and the
  head guide, under the capstan, over the top of the takeup reel.
  Insert finger into hole in takeup reel to hold tape against the
  hub, then turn the takeup reel two revolutions.  Extract finger.
  Press LOAD.  Watch take-up reel win tug-of-war.
  Hear the SLURP and watch tape run forward.
  As soon as BOT/LOAD-POINT light came one, press ON-LINE.

Hate to disagree with you Barb, but hardware's my old expertise. (Mostly
PDP11's and Vaxen -- but I got to fix TU45's and TU77's and TU78's on
KLs when the LCG Field Service guys needed tape expertise.

The worst magtape made by DEC was the Tape Stretcher-11.
The second worst was the TU10 -- DEC's first 10 inch tape design.
The next was the TU16.  The TE16 was reliable as hell and just as slow.

DEC finally learned to buy decent tape drives with the Keystone drives
they got from CDC/LaserMagnetics (LMSI).  These became the TU80/81/TA8x.
They were cheap and reliable.

The only drives that DEC should've considerd were the HP88700 (I think
that's the name) series of front loading drives.

The TU45/70/78's were bastard children.  Half DEC -- well, mostly Pertec.

The TU45/77/78 tape transports were all Pertec designs (with some Dec 
engineering mods to "increase" reliablility. Like they did on the
DataProducts printers).

The TU45 was originally coming out of special systems as a stopgap for
the PDP10 line of machines which needed a limited number of drives in a
price range between the TU/TE16's and the TU77's which were in design
at Pertec.)

According to my old DEC tape instructor -- Pertec had to pull almost all
it's tape engineers off the TU77 to fix the 45.  I was told it was like
two more years to get them fixed.  DEC planned to sell less than 200
TU45's -- but they did thousands.  And fixed 'em, again and again.
My two favorites caught fire on me while working on 'em.  The other two
on the site were still running in '86 when I last heard of them.

They were pretty much abandonned in place on line for the pair of dual
ported TU77's and the TU78 at the site.

The TU45's split vacuum column and the tricky tach designs and tape path
caused no end of load problems and adjustment issues.

Any defects and scallopped edges in the tape caused a vaccum drop.

The TU45 was supposedly Pertec's first vacuum drive (it shows) and the
prints are very closely based off their earlier tension arm designs.

The TU77 and TU78 and TU45 had DEC designed formatters to allow them to
interface to the Pattented DEC MassBus.  The formatter for the TU77 and
TU45 was the TM03 (an ok device -- but nothing special...)

The whiz bang toy was the TM78 which had more bells and whistles than
almost any DEC controller I've ever seen.

The Tape Stretcher-11  has the problem (in non-ECO'd versions) of being
the worst DEC tape drive to load (it's brakes are on during the load
sequence making it a bitch to load).

It also used triacs in the motor control circuitry which could kick on
by electrical noise on it's power lines.  

This caused both motors to go on in full speed mode in
opposite directions.  This stretched the tape -- destroying all
data -- and leaving it wrapped around the reel with the strongest motor.

Hence, the name.  By 1984 the ECO's (total new firmware -- about 10
roms) a dead-bug glued chip on the back of the control board and some
nice fat coils in line with the motors for noise rejection) removed the
break effect at load time and eliminated the problem with the AC noise
motor-on.

I did a number of these ECO's...  The TS11 goes down as DEC's worst tape
drive.  The DECtape was it's only real good one.

TPC files are annoying because you can't efficiently backspace when
using them on a simulator.

I use John Wilson's format, which has a record length both before
and after the record.  Supnik's simulators for other PDP's support
this, and I've hacked it into Stu Grossman's KX10.

A Linux program I use with an HP 88780 is available at:
	http://www.36bit.org/dec/software/unix-util/

It should be easy to convert Wilson format tape images to/from TPC,
but I'm not aware of any existing code to do it.

The Supnik simulator package comes with such a tool, under the
name "mtcvtv23" (so-called because the Supnik simulators prior
to V2.3 used the far-more-common-in-archives TPC format.)

Eric:

I looked into your archive site about tapeutils-0.6 stuffs.  I downloaded
and tried it.   It worked so well for
my Red Hat Linux 7 system!   I had older copies of read20 and 10backup that
is designed for tpc format did
not work so well.   Ok, I will convert my all tpc files that I downloaded
>from  Tim Shoppa's archives (everything ) to Wilson's tape format after
I added Wilson's tape format to my emulator so that it can read Wilson's
tape format files.

Thank you for new tape utilities.
