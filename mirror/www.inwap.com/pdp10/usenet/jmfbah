Alas, that is one of the wars that I lost.  As part of my "wrap
it up and turn the lights out" plan for TOPS10, I wanted all 
the manuals that we had in bits put on a tape and shipped to
our customers as a last hurrah.  I do apologize although I
did fight long and hard and have a number of scars. :-)

Yup.  I had forgotten what constraints were required when there
were a lot of users with limited resources.  We didn't usually
have that.  We were spoiled in the resource department once we
got the resource.  If I allowed access to our -10 to someone,
they could just about have the quotas set to infinity unless
they stopped honoring the gentleman's timesharing agreement.

I had that package shipped on the Customer Supported Tape, Ric.
Once Jim and I got that tape past the idiots who had to approve
everything, I put everything I could on that tape that I thought
would be useful to the customers and all the "old stuff" that
noone seemed to be interested in anymore.  That was one of our
ways to skin the "we have to charge for everything!" cat that
afflicted us beginning in the early 80s.
