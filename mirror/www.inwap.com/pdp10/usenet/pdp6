Alas, that PDP-6 was scrapped.  I have a registers board from that
machine.

Stanford's PDP-6 was not retired until c.1980 when SAIL moved from the DC
Power Building to Margaret Jacks Hall, breaking up the world's only triple
processor KL/KA/PDP-6 system.  The KL and KA moved, the PDP-6 stayed.  The
DC Power Building was taken over by the Computer Music folks, who were
also the last users of the PDP-6.  The PDP-6 ran a stripped down version
of the monitor called "Mule" and was used to operate the various music
synthesizers.  I don't know if the PDP-6 was used after the KL/KA moved;
the Computer Music people used a Foonly (PDP-10 clone) which ran the same
OS as SAIL.

The PDP-6 was at DECUS for the 20th anniversary of 36 bits in 1984, and
subsequently was donated to the Computer Museum.  A big mistake.

Normally I don't post to alt.* groups, but in this case I'll make an
exception.

This is probably only of academic interest, since I believe that the
Computer Museum destroyed the last working PDP-6 in the world which was
donated to them 14 years ago.  Unfortunately, I do not have any PDP-6
prints; I do have several PDP-6 manuals and the diagnostic paper tape for
the CONS instruction which was on SAIL's PDP-6 (see above re "last working
PDP-6 in the world").

I thought that I had a comparison chart that covered the PDP-6, but I
don't, so here's what I came up with in a quick compare of the "Programmed
Data Processor-6 Handbook" (DEC manual F-65 dated 8/64) with the "PDP-10
System Reference Manual."  I concentrated on user program differences with
the KD-10; it would take a lot longer to work out all the exec program
differences.

The PDP-6 did not have UFA, DFN, JFFO.

JFCL 1, tests PC Change on the PDP-6, Floating Overflow on the PDP-10.
AFAIK, this was the only way to skip or jump on the PDP-6 without setting
PC Change!

The PDP-6 did not have high segments or User I/O Mode.

All UUOs are MUUOs on the PDP-6.

All unassigned instructions are no-ops on the PDP-6.


The PDP-6 was, of course, much flakier than the KA10.  The PDP-10 was in
every way a superior machine, even though it was not significantly faster
than the PDP-6.

Processor Reference Manual AA-H391A-TK (July 1980) page 2-112:
2.15 Programming Examples, Processor Identification.

    The instruction repertoires of all PDP-10 processors and the 166
    processor used in the PDP-6 are very similar, and most programs
    require no changes to run on any of them.  Because of minor
    differences and the fact that some instructions are not availabel
    on the eariler machines, a progrma that is to be compatible with
    all should have some way of distinguishing which machine it is
    running on.  This simple test suffices.

Here is information from Appendix E of HARDWARE REFERENCE MANUAL
DEC-10-XSRNA-A-D (Feb 1975) which covers the PDP-6 the KA10 and the
KI10.  I'm leaving out the KI and any area where the '6 and the KA are
the same, and summarizing some text;

Address Break
	PDP-6		No.
	KA10		Switch and flag

Address stop
	PDP-6	switches compared with virtual addresses (unreloacted)	
	KA10	switches compared with physical addresses (relocated)

Byte pointer incrementing
	PDP-6	Address overflow carries into index field, and EA calc
		from the pointer uses the new index register
	KA10	Address overflow carries, but ILDB or IDPB use
		original index register, unless an interrupt occurs
		between the two parts of the the instruction, in which
		case the updated index register is used.

Carry flags
	PDP-6	Subtractiuon done in 3 steps: complement minuend,
		add, complement sum.  The resulting effect on the Carry
		flags is the opposite of that listed of SUB, SOJ and SOS
	KA10	Subtraction done directly

	KA10	DATAI APR, and DATAO PI, to load MI

First Part Done
	PDP-6	Set only by interrupt between parts of an IDPB or ILDB,
		and cleared only when the PC word is saved by an interrupt
		instruction or an instruction executed by a UUO.

	KA10	Set same as PDP-6, but cleared whenever PC word is saved.

Floating Overflow
	PDP-6	No.
	KA10	Yes - in PC and processor conditions.

FP Instructions
	PDP-6	FSC plus four standard operations, with and without

	KA10	PDP-6 complement, except Immediate replaces Long with
		routing, plus UFA and DFN to facilitate double precision.

FP Immediate mode
	PDP-6	No.
	KA10	Yes - operand E,0, but only with rounding
		(FADRI, FSBRI, FMPRI, FDVRI)

FP Long mode FADL, FSBL, FMPL
	PDP-6	In low order word, fraction begins in bit 1 (no exponent)
		and sign is not forced to 0.
	KA10	Low order word has fraction and expoenet in standard

FP Long mode With rounding
	PDP-6	Stores meaningless low order word or remainder
	KA10	Replaced by immediate mode.

FP Long mode: FDVL
	PDP-6	Remainder is incorrect and lacks exponent
	KA10	Correct remainder stored in std. FP format, but not normalized

FP Normalization
	PDP-6	In add subtract and multiply if high order word of double
		length result is (positive) zero, no normalization takes place.

DMP files.  All words from JOBCDP (location 75) to the location pointed to
by JOBFF.  If DDT is loaded, DDT's symbol table was also dumped. [Verified
from the "PDP-6 Multiprogramming System Manual" dated 4/66]

Unlike SAV files, a DMP file was a straight binary dump that could be
loaded with a single IOWD.  I am pretty sure that the first PDP-10
monitors also used DMP files, and that SAV files came in somewhere in late
3 series or 4 series.

WAITS, SAIL's OS, used DMP files until it was retired in 1990; it's last
common ancestor was TOPS-10 was 3.54.  I was a system programmer on WAITS
from 1977-1979 (and occasionally after that; my main responsibility after
1979 was the Score DEC-20) and remember DMP files quite well.

I was told that Berkeley actually had 5.07 running on their PDP-6 before
it was retired.

Oh, good, a discussion of lights and switches, a subject near and dear to my
heart!

I don't know about the exact switch types, but the watershed in packaging is the
PDP-8.

I believe that all of the earlier machines (1,4,5,6,7) had brushed aluminum
front panels,
and panels at the top of the cabinets, with toggle switches and lights in small
cylinders
with flat, translucent white tops that that stuck through a hole in the aluminum
panel and
plugged into a couple of little contacts on a circuit board under the panel.  I
salvaged a
cabinet top panel from a PDP-7 with the I/O-related lights as cheap scrap from
American
Used Computer (or was it American Abused Computer? :-) in Boston near Kenmore
Sq.
long ago.  The labels were silkscreened onto the aluminum panel.  And of course
they
used System Modules and soldered backplanes and were packaged in relay racks,
since the panels of sockets had to be bolted into the panel before the wires
were added.

The interconnect problems of the PDP-6, the appearance of the Sylvania
wirewrap sockets and Gardner-Denver wirewrap machine, and the prospect
of building many, cheap computers on an assembly line forced changes.

Starting with the PDP-8, DEC machines had slide switches with plastic bats.
The lights and switches were on a large circuit board and shone through or
stuck through or below the silkscreened sheet of plastic with the labels on it.
On the 8, the 2 key switches (one on the right and one on the left, one for
power
and one for panel lock, I think) were *really* there to hold the sheet of
plastic in
place.  At least some of this was Ken Olsen's idea.  In a lecture he said that
he hung out a Lechmere (a large department store) studying the appliances to
find a cheaper way, to the point where he thought the store staff suspected him
of "casing the joint" for a possible robbery.  (That might have been the talk
where
Gordon Bell introduced Ken as a packaging engineer on his staff. :-)
And of course they used Flip Chips and the wirewrapped backplanes.
Also, this is where, for the smaller machines, the package starts moving from
the
rack down to a box that fits into the rack, which let the embedded systems
market
happen.  Later they added those white-edged black panels that plug onto the rack

to cover up the box.

Some of the later 11s (45, 70) might have had real toggle switches under the
bats,
but the 11/20 had slide switches like the 8s.

[Hmm, I guess that screening the plastic panel and molding the plastic bats
were what let DEC get into interesting colors for their machines.  Reviving
a notable feature of the ancestral TX-0?]

My recollection is that some machines used stiffer plastic in the bats
(8, 11/10, 11/45, 11/70) while others used softer plastic (8/e, 11/20)
but I don't know for sure.  Maybe someone with can say what the
plastics were.  Earlier machines used flat-handled bats, while later 11s
(45, 70) used triangular bats and the metal bezel(?) around the edge of
the front panel was molded at the bottom to stick out in the same shape
as the switches.  I think that was to protect the switches.  Little pins
on the sides fit into holes on metal pieces on each side of the "real" switch.

Re: pushing vs. pulling somewhere in this thread: The deposit switch was usually

upside-down so that you had to flip it up above the neutral position instead of
flipping it down, to make it harder to accidently change memory.  And it was
spring-loaded so it returned to its normal position.

Several machines (KA10, PDP-8/<I forget which one>, PDP-12, PDP-15 or XVM)
had the rocker switches.  I was under the impression that the rocker switches
were
covers over slide switches like the bats, but I don't think I ever saw under one
to be
sure.

The KI10 was a (very nice to look at, anyway) anomoly.  I don't know why it used

the push-buttons with lights in them.

There are a few PDP-11 pictures at

8I's, 12's and 15's use rocker style slide switches

The 11/05,11/10 were the first 11's to use Alco molded switches which were used
on all subsequent front panels. These were also the same switches (sans plastic
frob) that were used on the Altair and with a frob on IMSAIs.

Standard maintenance on a PDP-6 was running a heavy tool across the
back of the boards (the contacts were on the front) to shake them up a
bit and seat them in their sockets better. It would solve many many
problems. Higher level maintenance was pulling the boards, staring at
them for a few seconds, and shoving them back in with lots of
wiggling. Harder problems would be solved that way.

So "bats" is the word du jour?  I think the KA had good old slide switches
under the bats.  You could clear the whole set by running the back of
your fingers along the row of switches, but the bats could rotate or twist
and bind a bit so I generally didn't do that.  With pressure directly on
the bat, they'd be quite happy to flop back and forth.  Only the friction
in the slide switch held them in position.

Chuckle.  That just shows how much you know :-).  I was flipping
8's and 11's way before your time in a group known then as Tape
Prep.  But I never got to work on that PDP-12 and I never met
a PDP-6...nor a 1.

Is this what happened to the Stanford PDP-6 of which the CM never even

Is that what happened to the Stanford PDP-6 after it was donated to the
Computer Museum in 1984?  That is disgusting.

The Stanford PDP-6 was perhaps the last operational PDP-6 in the world.  
It was part of the Stanford AI Lab tri-processor KL10/KA10/PDP-6 system
until 1980, when the KL and KA moved from the DC Power Building to
Margaret Jacks Hall.  I was at SAIL from 1977 - 1979 (when I became the
system programmer for the Computer Science DEC-20) and have fond memories
of seeing the old gal put through her paces.

The PDP-6 had its own 64K core memory bank, and was used as a dedicated
machine to operate the synthesizers used by the computer music group.

The PDP-6 stayed at DC Power, along with the Computer Music group.  I
don't know if the PDP-6 was ever run with the Foonly, but I think that the
musicians attached the synthesizers directly to the Foonly and the PDP-6
was retired after the tri-processor was broken up.

I saw it running at the 20th anniversary celebration in 1984, but
apparently some register bit was stuck on so they had to program around it
in making a little light-blinking program.  [Which reminds me, we need a
36th anniversary celebration next year...]

Well, I confess, the KA10 had a similar fate.  It was used as an XGP
(XeroGraphic Printer) controller, and finally toasted itself due to a
cooling fan failure.  At that point, it was considered unrepairable,
retired, and I presently bought it for $500.  I took the front panel,
light panels, and adder boards for myself; I sent the BBN Pager to the
Swedish hackers; and the rest was sold to a scrap metal dealer.

The Swedish hackers were a bit distressed at the demolition of an
historical KA, but it really was toasted.  The last I heard, the BBN Pager
had been installed in a KA in Sweden and was running Tenex (many, many
years after it was supplied to SAIL with the intent of getting SAIL to run
Tenex).

I still have that front panel, as well as the front panel to one of the
IMSSS KI10s.

Since the instruction set is almost the same, why specifically a PDP-6?

If you search old articles via dejanews or somesuch for PDP-6, there have
been discussions in the past about which instructions are different.
Also, check out the PDP-10 links at www.36bit.org, there may be some
information there.

The family tree goes PDP-6, KA, KI, KL (KS is off to the side a bit.)
A PDP-6 emulator would disable a bunch of instructions and paging plus
change some details of a couple of instructions in minor ways.  I'm not
sure about the last edition but most of the hardware reference manuals
for the -10 included a section or notes on the differences between
processors.

Good luck, Sam

Maybe his point was just that the other machines were each bigger and
meaner than their predecessors, but the KS was just intended to be less
expensive so it was a big step down as far as performance and features
went.  So it's not part of the stepwise progression that the others were...

The PDP-3 was a 36-bit machine; however, its architecture had nothing in
common with the PDP-6 or the PDP-10.  It doesn't belong in the family
tree.

I would be inclined to agree with Mr. Crispin on this one.  For instance, if
you were to discuss the DG Nova, I would put it in the PDP-5/8/12 family (12
bit) and not the PDP-11 family (16 bit) based on how the machines worked,
and not just the word length.  For that matter, the Nicolet 1080 (20 bits)
seemed to be strongly influenced by the PDP-8, while the 1180 (again 20
bits) seemed more influenced by the Nova.

Also as I recall, one PDP-3 was built, but not by DEC.  It would be thus be
more difficult for it to influence later DEC designs, either in hardware or
software.

The hardware design, and I *believe* (pending getting around to filing a
Freedom of Information Act request to get the specifics) some of the software
was designed by DEC - (previous posts here have connected the company that
built it with a CIA shell declassified in the 1970s) It was built out of DEC
modules on DEC racks to DEC standards.

Last known running in Oregon 25 years ago under MIT's ownership (Bell et al.)
It may be running yet. 

Again, if we are going to fall into "how the machines worked" mentality, then
the "PDP-11 family" is not a family at all, because (like the 7-9-15 series)
the instruction set was implemented in so many different ways using multiple
bus systems, etc. Do Unibus MASSBus and LSIBus systems work the same way?

Does the DECMate belong in the PDP-8 family? How about the 8/A? 8/S?

Are all CPM/DOS machines in the PDP-8 family because of the structure, command
set and nature of the OS?|

The 18-bit series is usually represented as 4,7,8,15.  The 1 did not have
a direct successor, except in the sense that the VAX was a "successor" to
the PDP-11.

However, the PDP-3 was a completely different architecture.  It had
36-bits, but otherwise had nothing in common with the 6/10.  The IBM 7090
with its CAR/CDR was closer to the PDP-6 than the PDP-3 (however, there's
really no similarity between the 7090's instructions and the PDP-6).  Or,
put another way, the PDP-6 was a completely new design, with Lisp strongly
influencing the architecture, and the 7090 was the contemporary Lisp
machine.

DEC never built a PDP-3; one was built by a DEC customer.  Generally, the
PDP-3 is excluded from the list of DEC computers (like the PDP-2).

This is also an important point.  Most user mode PDP-6 programs will run
on every subsequent PDP-10 processor and emulators, including the non-DEC
machines (Maxc, Foonly, SC, and XKL).  You could make a PDP-6 only program
if you tried hard enough (e.g. depending upon the PC change flag), but few
people did.  SAIL never used the CONS instruction in PDP-6 Lisp (someday,
I intend to read in the paper tape for the CONS diagnostic and find out
how it worked).

Going the other way (running a PDP-10 program on a PDP-6) depends upon not
using hisegs, not using new system calls (the last TOPS-10 monitor that
ran on a PDP-6 was 5.07), and being careful with floating point.

There was no such path with the PDP-1 and the 4/7/9/15.  PDP-1 programs
died with the PDP-1.

Did 5.07 really run on a PDP6? I spent some time helping the physics 
department at Rutgers upgrade to a -10 so they could get off of 4.50 or 4.72
or something like that. (I think I am remembering this right, it was in 1972

Yes, the University of California at Berkeley PDP-6 ran 5.07 before it was
retired.

Regrettably, I never got to meet the beast, although I have one of its
6205 boards.  I did meet the MIT AI and DM PDP-6s, as well as the SAIL
PDP-6.  In fact, I remember both the AI and SAIL PDP-6s as operational
systems.  Neither ran TOPS-10, though.

Only on TOPS-20 running on a KL with nonzero sections.
Not on TOPS-20 on a KS, not on TOPS-10 with microcode prior to what was
shipped with 7.04.  The comment about not using hisegs automatically
eliminates extended addressing.

ADJBP and ADJSP did not exist on the KA or KI either.  Rumor has it that
someone added some NOR gates to their KI to cause an illegal instruction
trap whenever the AC field of an IBP instruction was nonzero so that they
could emulate ADJBP in software.

Most of the other fancy byte-string manipulation instructions (such as
MOVST, CVTBDO and EDIT) were used only by the COBOL compiler.  Only
MOVSLJ and XBLT were really useful.

Here's a posting from a few years ago which gives the differences.

Normally I don't post to alt.* groups, but in this case I'll make an
exception.

This is probably only of academic interest, since I believe that the
Computer Museum destroyed the last working PDP-6 in the world which was
donated to them 14 years ago.  Unfortunately, I do not have any PDP-6
prints; I do have several PDP-6 manuals and the diagnostic paper tape for
the CONS instruction which was on SAIL's PDP-6 (see above re "last working
PDP-6 in the world").

I thought that I had a comparison chart that covered the PDP-6, but I
don't, so here's what I came up with in a quick compare of the "Programmed
Data Processor-6 Handbook" (DEC manual F-65 dated 8/64) with the "PDP-10
System Reference Manual."  I concentrated on user program differences with
the KD-10; it would take a lot longer to work out all the exec program
differences.

The PDP-6 did not have UFA, DFN, JFFO.

JFCL 1, tests PC Change on the PDP-6, Floating Overflow on the PDP-10.
AFAIK, this was the only way to skip or jump on the PDP-6 without setting
PC Change!

The PDP-6 did not have high segments or User I/O Mode.

All UUOs are MUUOs on the PDP-6.

All unassigned instructions are no-ops on the PDP-6.


The PDP-6 was, of course, much flakier than the KA10.  The PDP-10 was in
every way a superior machine, even though it was not significantly faster
than the PDP-6.

Hunt arround over there Wil, several sections of the 6/KA-10 went to UQ
when UWA got the KL. Therer may still be bits around that Max has not

ONE, the first, PDP-6 came to .au. It was sold to UWA in '64. The
'console' bays are at the Wireless Hill Museum, and the display is
in ACMS(WA) store. Two stripped out cab are still at UWA with coms
gear in them. I have the nameplate from the 630. The PDP-8 disk
controller is at a friends place.

Hum, change nameplate to namePLATE. It is 1/4" think machined Al.

Hey, I got the opportunity to see it in place at the D. C. Power Lab just
before it was dismantled for its trip to Anaheim for the 20th Anniversary.

I got to see its beginning; I helped Bob and the rest
of the AI crew push it onto the raised floor.  I was
its system programmer from then until 1969, and worked
on 10's and 20's until 1978, when I defected to the
VAX.  Nevertheless, I don't consider it, or any
computer, beloved.  Not even the PDP-1, which was the
first computer I programmed.  When you have seen
enough of your friends die, you get defensive and
thick-skinned.  They're only computers.

John Sauter responded:

As far as I know, Stanford had only one PDP-6, and it was
among the last ones manufactured.  Before the arrival
of SAIL's KA10 I believe it had only 64 K words.  
After the KA10 was installed we ran a two-CPU system 
(KA10 and 166, with the 166 operating as a slave)
and I think the memory was increased after that, 
but a system that includes a KA10 is not, strictly 
speaking, a PDP-6 any more.

The MIT AI Lab PDP-6 had a full moby (Fabritek), an unheard-of thing at
the time.  I don't know if Stanford's PDP-6 ever did; at the time I was
there (starting in 1977) it only had the original 64K memory box.

The 162 (a.k.a. fast ACs) was still there in 1977 when I started work at
SAIL, but the 163s were gone, replaced with this big honking box that held
all of 64K.

The story I was told, twice, once by a ex Tops developer, and once by
someone from DEC oz, was that <site> had expanded the memory on their
6.  It was booted, and nothing happened. Dead as a maggo. Then the
penny dropped, it was sizing memory, and waiting for the NXM as it
counted up :) I thought it was Stanford.

John Sauter retorted:

I can't be sure it wasn't Stanford, but Stanford had
only one PDP-6, and I was the System Programmer at
the AI Lab from 1964 (when we got the system) until
1969, and I don't recall it happening.  At the time
I left we still had the 166, but the system was no
longer a PDP-6, strictly speaking, because it also
had a KA10 processor.  Perhaps the system was later
split up, and 256KW of memory was put on the 166?

What's a maggo?

Despite the PC change flag and other understandable mistakes the PDP-6
was still a machine of great beauty. I for one loved it dearly, else
why would  I have gone at 3am to the UWA computing centre week in and
week out for months to work on my print spooler and other changes to
the OS. I might add completely UNPAID and unthanked. I did however get
some free time for my trouble.

The unis are on xmas hols, for a variable time, so I'd not hold
my breath at this time of the year. :) 

It seems to have dropped of the face of the DNS to boot...

BTW, they got the pdp-6 memory boxes from UWA as I remember.

Or if not the KA10, what about DEC's PDP-6 systems?  SAIL was originally 
a PDP-6 when it went online in 1966.  Eventually it was upgraded to a more
capable processor, but how long did they run with on the PDP-6; was it
long enough to have it connected to Arpanet?  Were there any other PDP-6
systems around that would've been on the net sometime during the 1970s?

Possibly. UWA had PDP-6 sn 4, the first one sold. In '72 it was
replaced by a Cyber 72... and a few month later, a KA-10 was installed.
There was much joy from many! That machine was one of the first to
use a packet switched net from UWA to WAIT in 74 (I think...I can
never remember if it was 74 or 75) The Arpanet was running to some
degree before that, so the SAIL 6 well could have been on it.
