Hello folks:

My KS10 developement seems successfully.  However, I have a problem with
REWIND command that my MIG manual asked me to do rewind a tape before I 
can get backup.exe into KS10's core memory and start it.  When it was
executed, I can install CUSP files into DSKB disk drive.

When I attempted to run REWIND TAPE: and system locked up.  I looked into
my log file and found out that an infinite loop was caught up because
TOPS-10 is looking for COMPIL.EXE on DSKB disk drive forever.  It looked
into UFD block but can't find anything then read HOM block again and again
forever.

Yes, I found another bug in my emulator because UUO instruction did not
performed properly.  I looked into my emulated UUO routine and found out
that they uses virtual memory instead of direct memory. I changed all
routines to access physical memory.  Now UUO instruction functions
correctly.  My log show that OPEN and LOOKUP instruction worked so well.

I figured out why TOPS-10 wants COMPIL.EXE for REWIND command.  I looked
into COMPIL.MAC and found REWIND command inside it.  Ah.  How do I rewind
a tape because I tried to install CUSP software into my DSKB disk drive?
My MIG told me to do REWIND command.

I tried some builtin commands on TOPS-10 and they worked so well.

That's not right (the manual).

The looking forever part is a bug.  There should at least be some
sort of timeout.

Yup.

Well, I never did a KS installation as a token dummy so I can't
tell you about that.  I have done a KL installation and I simply
don't remember the MIG telling people to do a rewind command
as the very first command.  IIRC, there are two GET BACKUP.EXE
commands, then a START, and then a REWIND command which is 
a BACKUP command.  

Now, the reason there are two GETs is to ensure that there's
at least on good copy of BACKUP.EXE that is GETtable. The
second GET command should position the magtape at the 
beginning of the first save set.  At the moment, I can't
remember what I put into that save set.  There is also 
a teensy little tickle in the back of my brain that's
telling me that the KS bootable tape was slightly different
in content than a KL bootable tape (I think the difference
was the KS also contained a GETtable copy of SMFILE.EXE)
but I'm not sure about that.  I'd have to take a look
at my build procedures to verify exactly what I put
on those tapes.  That's probably another piece of very
useful information that's been destroyed.

I have no idea why 512 is the default here.  You should really
be using 4096 if you want to be able to capture crashes.
Actually that does bring up a point.  How much memory is
available in an emulator so that complete dumps of crashes
(STOPCDs) can be captured.

I wonder if a discussion of these defaults would make any sense
at the moment.
