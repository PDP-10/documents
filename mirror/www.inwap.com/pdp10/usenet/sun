There were SUN machines before there was a company called Sun. SUN
stands for "Stanford University Network". As I understand it, there
was a major effort to build lots of 68000-based workstations with
bitmap displays, connected by a campus-wide Ethernet (which had just
been souped up from 2MB/sec to 10MB/sec). This was all fit into a
MULTIBUS backplane. There were a couple of manufacturers of the SUN/1
processor board, which included some quantity of on-board memory. I
don't know if these machines ever ran actual Unix.

Anyway, the SUN/1 board became the nucleus of a startup company that
called itself "Sun". I believe Bill Joy came from being a Unix honcho
at Berkeley to be a founder, as well. There was another project to
build a high-performance 3D graphics subsystem; this was called IRIS,
for "Integrated Raster Imaging System". It spun off into Silicon
Graphics.

The SUN processor project predated 10Mbit Ethernet by quite some time; we were
still installing 10Mb when I got to Stanford in 1984, and there was a *lot* of
"yellow peril" 3Mb cable under the machine room floor at LOTS.

The SUN processor was intended to be the CPU for a "3M" machine (1MIPS, 1MB of
memory, and 1 million pixels on the display screen).  It was used by several
Stanford-derived startups, such as Sun and 'cisco Systems (oldest spelling).

The Sun 100U had a Sun-2 (68010) CPU. The actual Sun-1 machines
had 68000 CPU cards.

I found a not-too-bad hardware history at this URL:
