FORTRAN-10/20 boiled down to these 10 with various addressing and
destination modes:

AND	IOR	EQV	XOR	ANDCM	ORCM
SETCA	SETCM	SETZ	SETO

BLISS-10 used at least these 13 (plus at least some of their addressing
and destination variations):

AND	OR	EQV	XOR	ANDCM	ORCM
ANDCA	ORCA	ANDCB	ORCB
SETCA	SETZ	SETO


(I'm more convinced than ever that all 16 operation families takes
little hardware if you provide all of them...)
