Okay, here goes...from memory almost thirty years old.

Pre Level-D (2.19, 3.27, 4S50, 4S72, etc.) there were no coding conventions 
used in the Monitor sources. There were significant differences in the 
appearance of the code in different modules. In fact I don't even think 
there were consistant AC names between modules. Placement of tabs within 
lines of instructions wasn't consistant either.

As I recall, some of the "old" ac names used were things like PDP, DDB (or 
DEV), TAC, TAC1, etc. A line of old code might look something like:

TAG:	PUSHJ	PDP,	SUBR	;GO DO SOMETHING

Or in another module like:

TAG1:	PUSHJ PDP,SUBR1		;GO DO SOMETHING ELSE

With the creation of the 5 series Monitor, there was a concerted effort to 
create a consistant "look" across all modules. The agreed to conventions 
were codified in a document produced by Tom Hastings called LEVELD.MEM. As I 
recall, some of the conventions defined were:

  Consistant AC names and definitions (F, P, T1-T4, etc.).

  Instruction formatting (placement of tabs and spaces within the 
instruction).

  Indenting convention for skip and non-skip returns.

  Commenting conventions; each line of code should have a comment, 
subroutines should have a comment header which starts ";HERE TO...", etc.

  Comment on a return instruction should start ";BACK TO"

  Creation and use of common return macros (CPOPJ, CPOPJ1).

The 5 series (Level-D) Monitor was a HUGE departure (and step forward) from 
previous releases. It was the first release with FILSER (designed by Chris 
White, Tom Hastings, and Tony Wachs; coded by TW) and the first release with 
common AC usage (I believe Don Black was responsible for the grunt work of 
pouring through the sources and making the changes). While I can't recall 
today whether the first 5 series release was called 5.00 or 5.01, getting it 
to work after all the significant changes was a monumental task.

Things have gotten so bad I feel the need to disguise my email address.
And I don't like this explanation because I just hate long signatures.

Though that didn't keep the stack pointer from being assigned to AC0 in
Bliss-10:

	SREG=0			; Stack pointer
	FREG=1			; Frame pointer
;	BREG=2			; Base [of stack] pointer
				; (ended up being reallocated to memory,
				; since no one used couroutines).
	VREG=3			; Value return register

Not only would the generated code from Bliss-10 not try and index off of the
stack pointer, if you made it a non-zero register, it still wouldn't take
advantage of it.

Fortran-10 (written in Bliss-10) used non-standard register assignments.  The
36 most common compiler flags (generate an object file, generate a listing
file, ...) were kept in AC0.  It has been observed that this was a real win
for debugging.  If someone stored through a NUL pointer, it would smash the
compiler flags, and soon enough you'd get an:

?IO to unassigned channel at user PC nnnnnn

when the compiler hauled off and suddenly started printing a listing file.
