The radio was listing all the "important people" who died in 1995.  Not
surprisingly, a few were not mentioned.  I would like to mention them here
for they should not be ignored or forgotten. 

James M. Flemming (JMF), my best friend who liked to be known as the guru
of TOPS10.

Peter F. Conklin (PFC), wrote RUNOFF, a very important part of my employ
at DEC in the early 70's.  He, of course, did more important things, but I
managed to get most of the TOPS10 Software Notebooks into RUNOFF format
before Typeset came along.

A special thought for the following People:

Tony Wachs (TW), my other best friend.
Todd Matson (WEM), the only person who had a stopcode named for him.
