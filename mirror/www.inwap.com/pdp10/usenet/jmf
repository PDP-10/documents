I decided to post because I knew of one person who would want to
know.

On May 22, 2000, I buried Jim's ashes in my burial plot in
Holland, Michigan.  I have arranged to have the plot marker
enscribed with the words:

TOPS-10 Guru
"Have EDDT, will travel"

along with his name, life span, a shamrock icon (there's a
story to go along with picking out that icon) and an adornment
of lily-of-the-valley.

It takes four weeks to make the marker, so I could not 
proof it.  My estimate is that there is a 30% chance there
will be a typo.....Sigh!  When the saleswoman said 
"parentheses" when she meant double quote, my confidence
level plummeted [wry emoticon here].
