In the released version of Tops-20, 32MW (one XMG-1 memory board).  We have
since made experimental versions of the OS that support multiple boards.

Those who have never seen the specs of the Toad-1 should be made aware that it
has a 7-slot active backplane; the default configuration is 1 each of the XKL-1
CPU, XMG-1 memory, XRH-1 4-port SCSI, and XNI-1 4-port Ethernet.  Depending on
application, an additional memory or SCSI is not an unreasonable addition, but
the older applications for which we originally targeted the system didn't need
that much memory or I/O (one SCSI board can support up to 60 devices).

Never thought about it, but Mr. Guccione should have included dates on his
pages; I supplied that info to him two or three years ago.

XKL has been in business since 1991; we shipped beta Toad-1 systems to customer
sites starting in October, 1995; merchantable units shipped from April, 1996.

Hi, folks!

We have a major hiring push on at XKL.  The new stuff is not directly PDP-10
related, but there are lots of Toad-1 Systems in the house.  What we're working
on is extremely exciting.

Details are available at our (temporary) revamped website, www.xkl.com.

For today, a different signature:

Let me second this.  If you would like to get paid to work with TOPS20
and code in Macro10 (and live in the Northwest), send us your resume or
look at our web site.  I'd be glad to answer questions.

No, they do not.  They use Type 1 fonts.

No, nor did it use Type 1 fonts, which were not yet available when the manual
was put into Postscript format.

Use Ghostscript for Windows--but since the fonts used in the document are
converted Metafont in Type 3 format, they will still be blocky.

I suggest that you write to webmaster@xkl.com and ask politely that they make a
PDF of the architecture manual available on their website.
