Not LOAD ADRS?  That would be consistant w/others.  But anyway yes it has to
be done in two steps.  IIRC the KS10's 8080A console emulator is the same,
you can't give an address in a deposit command (only data) so you need to
load up the address pointer with another command first.

As to switches:

PDP-6 had lovely switches. The best ever. There were large toggle
switches (something like the bat-wing switches on British motor cars
except round and tapered and longer, made of brushed aluminum, I
think) for control functions and then little microswitches for things
like address and data. These had the advantage of staying up or down
after being pushed, so you could run your finger along them and "feel"
the address to make sure it was right, or look at them and see.
Feeling was easier and faster. The console looked like something that
would be built in a laboratory rather than a piece of commercial gear.

The KA-10 had awful switches - rocker switches made of colored
plastic. Probably cheaper, maybe more reliable, but not as aesthetic.

The KI-10 had absolutely lovely switches again- square translucent
switches with lights built into them. When you pushed a switch the
light would (might) come on. Very Star Trek. Looked the way a computer
should. Beam me up, Scottie.

The KL ... well, enuf said.

The 11/40 (/35, /45, /55, /70) had essentially triangular shaped
switches with a rounded apex sticking out from the panel.  It
had a pivot point located in the center of the base of the triangle.

the KA10 has the same style of toggle switches (rockers) as the
pdp-8/i.  The KI10 had square, momentary contact pushbuttons.

Yep.  And the 680I responded to READ-IN_MODE, and could be used to
squirt a bootstrap program into the KA's memory.  (This was instead of
relying on the paper-tape reader to load in the bootstrap that knew
how to talk to RP02 disk drives.)

Later on, DCA (Digital Communications Associates of Norcross, Georgia) came
out with another box that lived on the -10's I/O bus and talked to remote
terminal concentrators.  We did not have an ANF-10 network at the Colorado
School of Mines, but I hacked in some of the network-related UUOs so that
SYSTAT and such could report which terminal multiplexor the TTY was connected
to.

That wasn't my reference.  All the momentary contact switches were
spring loaded triangles that you pushed down and would spring back.
Deposit was the one exception - you had to lift it up and it would
spring down.  BAH - I don't think you ever had much need to muck
with bits on the various -11s.  Rebooting them was mostly setting the
start address in the switches and pushing load address and start.

The KA rocker switches were nicely rounded and had a much better feel
than most other console switches.  I often copied an address from the
data light down to the address switches, then added an offset directly
into the switches (think of a binary abacus) to get to important data
when I couldn't use DDT or EDDT.

I've been wondering about this, most of the DEC front panels seemed to use
switches that were a bit substantial for my tastes, were they really that
easy to use?  The thing I like about my 8/E's front panel is that the flimsy
little bat switches (really slide switches with bats mounted over them) are
very lightweight so it's easy to change the switches quickly by whacking them
with the side of your finger, but the KA10 rockers and most PDP-11 triangles
look like you'd have to go a lot more slowly since it takes a good solid poke
to flip them.  Am I wrong?

No. You're not wrong. The KA10 switches were lightweight junk plastic,
but weren't like the PDP-11 switches (they were, as has been pointed
out earlier, like certain PDP-8 switches). The problem with the KA-10
switches was that they were multi-colored flimsy rocker switches. The
PDP-6 sported wonderful positive action microswitches that gave a
satisfying click when you switched them. Coupled with the brushed
aluminum panel, you felt like you were really doing science when you
used the machine. Dr. Who would have been proud to use them.

Most flavors of PDP-11 console switches were, by and large, thin
trapozoidal plastic jobbers (you call them triangles), but at least
they'd stay where you put them. Still, no self-respecting mad
scientist would have had them on the Tardis for a minute.

Several bouts of serious memory deposits with the PDP-6 could give you
finger callouses. The PDP-10 would probably give you finger cramps.
The KI-10 would give you hallucinations because of all the pretty
blinkin-lights. Still, all of these were probably better than the
PDP-11 Kaymart "triangles."

Given my druthers, it would be the PDP-6 or the KI-10. Hard to chose
between them. Love them blinkin-light-switches, but the "click" of the
PDP-1/PDP-6 switches, and the wonderful truncated cone toggle-switches
for control functions had a really nice tactile/auditory experience.

In fact, that really rings a bell.  How the 680 worked, and the sampling
rates involved was related to how a UART worked, and I remember someone, or
a group of programmers at Stevens (possibly including Mr. Crispin, Mr.
Martin and others) explaining sampling to me, and the difference between 5
samples per bit and 8 samples per bit is familiar.  It is hard to remember
because there was one big terminal room with 7 model 35's, and 2 model 33's
and people chatted in loud conversations over the noise.  Help was not that
far away!  They also had big flat tables on either side, good for printouts,
which come to think of it, I would do well to emulate!

The official designation of the PDP8/I "world's largest UART" was DCA-680,
and, if I remember correctly, it was not exactly 100% a DEC product
(developed, if I remember the nameplate on the LIRICS KA-10 unit properly) by
Digital Communications Associates, hence the designation.

The DCA-680 could handle at least 72 Bell Datapump standard connections (I
believe the standard number was 103) of up to 300 baud, symetric, each. Most
lines ran slower, at 110 baud because of the common use of ASR-33 Teletypes at
the far end.

It also accepted multiple-line connections into early MUX's for transmission
over leased lines with the greatest of ease.

The system had some neat features - especially the ability, by throwing one
bit switch on the constantly-monitored 8/I front panel, to give the 8/I CTY
the ability to link directly to a given terminal.

With 72 high school users frequently trying rather poor attacks on the LIRICS
system, it was a great way to scare some would-be hacker to near-death when
the KA-10 DAEMON indicated someone was attempting to break the system. (click,
input port number, type "the machine is not happy with you")

Ahhh for the good old days...

Actually, the DC76 became the DN8x series. Lots of code was stolen.
The decision was made that the DC76 wasn't really supportable, because
the code sort of wandered everywhere. So it was rewritten in its
entirety.

The king of the DC76 programmers wasn't actually at DEC -- it was a
person at NIH who knew the code by heart (I think he dreamt DC76 code)
and who would find bugs in code that they never even used. DEC tried
very hard to replace all DC76 boxes with DN8x upgrades, even offering
them at no cost so we wouldn't have to support it anymore. However, if
all you wanted was lots of terminals, the DC76 worked just fine (it
had LPT and CDR support, but it never really worked that well). Also,
the DC76 used older ANF-10 protocols that we always hoped we could
write out of existence. Like all good things, the wish was never
fulfilled because people had it working with local hacks, and didn't
want to replace it.

The ARPAnet started in 1969, CMU was on the net in a year or so.  I
think I installed the first RFC 542 FTP client in September 1972 just before
vacation, largely driven by the AI group's claim that Stanford would
have their server running real soon now.  (Got back from vacation and
found my code didn't work.  Sigh.)  The new Telnet was implemented in
73.  Ed Taft at Harvard did TOPS-10 servers for FTP and TELNET.

When I got to DEC, I joined a group looking into terminal protocols
for DECnet.  I pushed for TELNET (and the ARPAnet protocols), but people
seemed intent on a protocol to fit DEC's needs.  If I had gotten there
about six months earlier perhaps I could have influenced things
better, but then again, there were some pretty strong personalities to
deal with and the NIH syndrome was pretty well entrenched.

Actually, there were a couple good things in ANF-10's terminal protocol,
but the whole company would have done better embracing the ARPAnet
protocols.  Better late than never!

When I joined DEC, Harvard and CMU were the only TOPS-10 systems on
the net.  Rutgers joined a year or so later.  It was all public domain
code.  DEC did a ARPAnet project, but that was after I left in 1978
to join a small company in NH working on a Z80 based printer.

To confirm the answer - ITS was on the ARPAnet, it had TELNET and FTP
and file sharing.  It had no use for DECnet or ANF-10.

After posting the following to alt.sys.pdp10, I read that Jon Postel,
ARPAnet pioneer and keeper of the Numbers, died last Friday.  I may have
met Jon briefly at USC-ISI in 1974. I did exchange some Email with him
over FTP.  Even then, it was clear that Jon was one of the vital people
in the ARPAnet community.

See http://www.isoc.org/isoc/media/releases/postel.shtml for more information.

   Yes. It was the -20s (KLs in different packaging) which booted from
floppy.

   Yes, again.

   ADP, too, at least when I left their employ in 1983, ran KLDCP as
the front-end software. All the interconnections were handled through
shared-memory links in -10-space, so RSX-20F wouldn't have gotten us
anything.

   If I recall correctly, we could boot KLDCP either from DECtape or
from an attached RP04(6?) via an RH-11 in the 11/40.

Tymshare had 13 KL's, 13 SA-10 PDP-10 to IBM channel adaptors, and a large
disk farm of IBM-compatible disks.

There was also 3 sets of RH20 boards, and one RP06.  If a KL-10 was so
sick that the diagnostics on DECtape weren't enough, the RP06 drive was
cabled up to the console front end RH-11.  There were more thorough
diagnostics on the KLAD pack.

Under extremely rare conditions, the RH-20 boards would be installed so
that the KL could be booted with TOPS-10 or TOPS-20 instead of TYMCOM-X.

Yep. You pretty much had to run 20F on TOPS-20 if you wanted to use those

Not that I know of. When I worked at Energy Enterprises in the 80s we were
one of the few sites in the world had a RSX-20F source license. (We also had
a TOPS-20 source license but that was another story.)

20F came on a RP06, and it took something like 8 hours to build from sources
on an 11/40... At EE, system 2110 had two RP06s dual-ported to the 11 for
this purpose.

It was kinda cool that you could run timesharing on the KL while 20F was
building on the 11/40!

I recall from perusing the sources that 20F was actually based on RSX-11D
(not -11M, like you would think).

Wasn't some other 36 bit front end product (loosely) based on -11S?  Like a
DN92 or something? Anyone remember this?

The reason we had 20F sources was so that Dawn Banks could hack in DZ11
support. We wanted to run DCA 205s, which were DZ11 emulators, in the CFE.
The alternative was tons of DH11s talking to stat muxes. The source license
for 20F plus DCA 205s was cheaper than all of those

Dawn's code worked great (as always) but the hardware was a pain. Those 205s
had hardware problems, and DCA visted from Atlanta (Norcross) in order to
make them work. You couldn't have more than one in each Unibus expansion
backplane - there had to be several inches of Unibus between them - or they
locked up at random times under load. So we added a couple of 4 slot Unibus
backplanes to the first bay of each of the 11/40s.

We ran two or three 205s in each CFE, each CFE was configured for something
like 96 DZ11 lines. We ended up with a pretty big all-DCA network connected
up to five 2065s (and a 2020 with a 205, and a couple of 11/44s) by the time
it all came crashing down in the late 80s. (I'm sure it would have been all
ANF10 if we were running Blue, but we were an Orange shop.)
