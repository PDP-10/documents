Well, I have a complete 2020 which is theoretically operational, but I
can't boot from distribution tape. Console commands work ok! It's over
a year since I spent any time on it, at some point I'll get back into
it and perhaps ask for advice here. I also have a partial KL, the CPU
and console (11/40) - I also had the I/O box, but it was lost, along
with another 2020, when the site I was storing them on was cleared
without anyone telling me!

I have had running 2020s at home since 1985.

I have my original machine (s/n 4664, possibly the highest serial number
assigned on 2020s?) plus the old SUMEX 2020 in running condition.  One
TU45 isn't working, and the LP05 didn't survive my move so got retired.  
But what I have is two 2020 systems, each with its own TU45, each dual
ported to two RM03s and two RM05 disks.

My best advice is; it is not for the faint of heart.

Ok. As they say: To everything, there is a time....

I just got the new power lines run into my spare bedroom//computer room. Two 
20amp 120 volt circuits, and a 20amp 240 volt circuit. Enough power to fire 
up my 2020 (AI), a pair of RM03's, an RM80 (totally unformatted) and a TU77 
(condition: Odd)

Now, a question: When I try to boot off the TU77, I get a console error. 
Checking the Massbus registers, it appears that the 20 is setting an "Invalid 
density value" in the drive density CSR. Odd thing is I can't clear the error 
by poking INIT commands into CSR1.

Does the 20 support the TU77 as a boot device, or am I going to have to roll 
a TU45 in here to get things up.

Also does anyone have any diagnostics on RM03 packs (or even better, TOPS20)? 
I ate one of my T20 packs in a head crash a few years ago.

Speaking of which: The pack failed as follows: Years ago I tried to clean the 
heads on an RM03 with 97% isopropyl alcohol and lintless swabs. Bad idea; 
just touching the heads must have screwed the flying geometry. When I put the 
pack in, and fired the drive up, the heads marched out and promptly gouged 
scores into the media. Didn't do any seeks, just plugged the outside track.

Would it be suicide to put this pack into another RM03? Anyplace left out 
there that might be able to recondition a pack? Or was the outside track 
track zero?

Thanks
Chris Zach

Checking the books, I found that this error (Invalid Density) can be caused 
by a microcode failure in the 8915 bit fiddler board (the formatter on 18 bit 
TU77's). Now, the questions:

Is it possible to find a new 8915-YA board? The one that I have will 
sometimes light it's red LED upon fireup. The light goes out in about 30 
seconds. Other times it flickers upon power up, and that's all. Is it 
possible that the problem is in the 8905-YB Maint register? According to the 
basic block diagram, these two are linked at the hip somehow.

I suppose I could pull the 8915 out of my TU45 (deep in storage) however I 
don't know if that's a YA, and if not, it won't work in a 125IPS tape drive 
(like the 77). And no, I don't want to try and fix the 45; it's a pneumatic 
nightmare...

Or I could try swapping in a 8906 and see if I can get the drive to do 
anything. 8906's are a dime a dozen; are there any backplane changes between 
the TM03 16 bits and the TM03 18 bits?

Any help appreciated. Getting this drive up is crucial.

Chris

It appears that I have a chance at getting a decsystem-10 of
my own... what is available is a KS10, with TM03 tape, TU77
tape and RP06 disks...  oh yeah, it also has a DZ11 and a
UBA...

Is the KS10 cabinet a single rack or more than one?  Would
there be other racks for the tape and disk controllers?

It's been a long time since I last even saw a -10, so I
need to know dimensions of the above devices...

Finally, if anyone is interested in helping dismantle this
machine, please contact me off-line...

   The KS-10 itself is a single cabinet about three feet on a side and
standing 4 or 5 feet tall. More or less. This includes the controllers
but none of the peripherals, especially disk.

   Did the KS-10 support any disks _other_ than Massbuss-based ones
(e.g. RP06)?

   RP devices (with the attached DCL - Device Control Logic - "side-
pack") were typically about two and a half feet wide and about three
feet deep. If I recall correctly, they require three-phase power (or
a good fake thereof) for operation.

> Finally, if anyone is interested in helping dismantle this

   I have it on good authority that you'll not need to disassemble it
if all you have is the processor -- two of them fit in the back of a
Plymouth Voyager minivan. One belongs to a fellow at the RCS/RI; the
other one is mine, and is currently in his care.

   Disks seem to be the bugaboo with these machines. If a substitute
for the large/heavy/power-hungry/hard-to-maintain/etc disks could be
found a KS would most likely make a wonderful little system. (I
remember RP-series drives, especially the RP04, with loathing from my
first job.)

   TOPS-10 anyone?

Official spec is 40"H x 31"W x 32"D, 600 lbs.  For comparison, washing
machines are about the same size, but have a density so much lighter
they may as well be styrofoam rocks you find falling on red shirts
in old episodes of _Star Trek_.

> If I recall correctly, they require three-phase power (or

You can, indeed, run two of them from one 120V 30A circuit with
a three-phase converter on it, as long as you're careful about
not spinning them both up at the same time.  See the
rec.crafts.metalworking FAQ for some good references about
the different varieties of three-phase converters available.

No, and officially it was only the RP06 and RM03 that were supported.
RM80 worked fine though...

That was one of the fancy enormous newer Voyagers with the dual sliding
doors though, the older ones can only hold one KS at a time.  An open-top
trailer is great because you can stand racks up.

KS and all controllers 1 5' rack IIRC, TU77 1 full rack, the TM03 is
IIRC the formatter/contoller fits in same rack (an 11/04 sized box)
and the RP06 is a large washing machine.

I've finally managed to partially satisfy
my nostalgic obsession to resurrect a PDP-10.

I just recently located a KS10, and, after a 480
mile mile trip in the back of my poor little
pickup truck, it is now safely sitting in front
of my garage (still in the truck... It will
be _in_ the garage as soon as I can con a couple
of my friends into giving me a hand. This is not
a light load :-)

The next thing I'm going to need is a Massbus
drive (preferably, an RM80) If anyone has one of
these that they would be willing to part with,
please drop me an email note. I'm located in
Virginia, but I'm willing to drive a reasonable
distance to pick one of these critters up (the
closer the better, of course :-) Shipping would
be impractical.

The other possibility is to build an adapter
that I could stick in a PC which would emulate
a Massbus device, but to do this, I'd need pretty
complete specs on the Massbus (i.e. pinouts,
timing, etc.) Does anyone happen to have this
info? I've done a dejanews search, but nothing
really useful turned up.

If I can locate a partially complete RM80 (i.e.
one with the Massbus to modified-SMD adapter
still present and intact in the drive pedistal,
then I might try to build an adapter to emulate
the modified-SMD interface supported by the
massbus adapter cardset. I suspect this might
be a simpler emulation, but it would still
require info on the modified-SMD interface 
supported by the RM80. If anyone has details
on this interface, please let me know!
  
BTW, I'm also on the lookout for TOPS-10 and/or
TOPS-20 load tapes (or images thereof, or bits
and pieces... whatever I can find that will get
me closer to bringing this critter back to life!

Actually it might not be 100% impossible, just a little expensive.  I bought
my first RM80 (the *working* one) from JT Computer Marketing in Texas, and
IIRC the shipping (to upstate NY) was something like $200.  Which of course
is a whole lot but less than half what it cost to drive to Houston for the
KSes themselves.

I've got pinouts for both DEC SMD (for a while) and Massbus (as of just now)
on my FTP/HTTP site.  No timing diagrams of course, so it's not all that
useful, slightly better than nothing though.

[Already sent to the classic computer collectors mailing list]

Just wanted to let eveyone know that I have been contacted by someone
who works for a company where they have three (3) KS10s.  One of the
machines is *CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL*.  One was shut down several months
ago, and the person who wrote to me doesn't know about the third.

There are nine (9) RP06 disk drives distributed between the three
systems, two additional ones are broken.  Two tape drives are on
line (with problems) and one is broken (one TM03 and two TU77s).

The computers are in a room without a raised floor, so the cables
are simply laying around.

The terms are that we (whoever) takes the equipment must do so at
their own cost, and must take everything, including cables and
non-working units.

Dismantling can start April 21st, removal has to be by April
27th.  No later than this.

The KS10s take up about 6sqft of floor space each, and are about 600 lbs.,
the RP06s apparently take up about 7-9 sqft and I don't know how much they
weight.  I don't know about the tape drives.

Someone told me it may be between 6000 and 8000 lbs all together...

Systems are located in Cambridge, Massachussetts.

We need to give an answer by April 13th at the latest.

I suspect that if it isn't saved, it will go to the scrapheap,
landfill, crusher, <fill_in_your_own_worst_nightmare_here>.

So, is anyone game?  Please contact me off-list.  I'll *try* to
coordinate this.

This is a chance to handle some *REAL IRON*...

DEC turned that into a fully supported product.  The microcode is not
nonstandard, it is merely "KS-10 microcode with KI-style paging" instead of
"KS-10 microcode with KL-style paging".  There are no hardware hacks at all.

The boot tape (1600 bpi, 1/2-inch) has the KS-10 microcode for TOPS-10 and
SYSTEM.EXE for KS.  On the same tape you would usually have BACKUP.EXE
and then the full-save of DSKB.

After reformatting the system RP06, we would restore [1,*] from the boot
tape, then get the most recent all-files save to restore the rest of the UFDs.

Nitpick:  it appears that ADP wasn't shy at all about making hardware
hacks on their OnSite KS10s (mine all have hacked CSL boards with special
firmware, and they substituted a different tape controller, plus I have
what appears to be a totally custom memory controller built by SC which I
believe was for the OnSites, 1024KW memory addressing or something).  But
those don't have anything to do with the ability to run TOPS-10.

As the person who ported TOPS-10 to the KS, and an ADP employee at the time, 
let me state that 1) Barb is correct, there were no special hacks required to 
run TOPS-10 on the KS, and 2) they did NOT pass through SC on their way to 
becoming ADP/Onsites.

As a "late life kicker" we contracted SC to do some hardware mods so that we 
could offer SMP Onsites. This project was code named "SuperSite", and wasn't a 
screaming success.

Well, that won't be the fate of the three KS10s a team of people
worked at moving today... a company in cambridge was getting
rid of them, and if we hadn't come along, they would have ended
up as landfill or in a crusher...

From what I understand, they were the last decsystem-10s in
commercial use in the new england region.  One is finding a
new home in New Hampshire... the other two will be at the
Rhode Island Computer Museum... we'll be unloading the
trucks tomorrow.

I have to admit that I don't know what city/town it is in... I followed
someone's badly hand-drawn map to it today, but it took me 2.5+ hours from
Framingham to find it.  It only took me 73 minutes to return.  I plan
on returning in the near future to help setup the machines.  It may
be awhile before they have the three-phase that the RP06s require,
but we can at least power up the system box and see if the console
works.

I have listings of the KS uCode (Version 101) and the KS10 console
code (with ADP modifications) as well as a KS10 printset (for KS10A
and KS10B -- what is the difference?).

Well, FORTRAN programs that used extended addressing would not run
on the KL.  Single-section KLs, that is.  A KS was very much like
a single-section KL, and there were a lot of single-section KLs out there.

Just to make things clear, both quotes are right.  The RH11-C differed
from the vanilla RH11 in two respects:

1) It used the parity lines as data lines in order to read and write
   18-bit quantities instead of 16-bit quantities.

2) It was jumpered to hog the bus for 16 memory cycles (32 halfwords).

There is a paragraph on page A-1 of the KS10-BASED DECSYSTEM-2020
TECHNICAL MANUAL that says:

	An NPR device cannot hog the bus for more than two memory
	cycles unless it is the only device connected to a UBA.
	(The RH11 disk controller in the standard 2020 configuration
	is jumpered to hog the bus for 16 memory cycles, however,
	it has a dedicated UBA.)

In addition to hog mode (as set by jumper on the RH11), the UBA had to be
programmed to operate in Fast Mode.  Only one UBA at a time could be run in
Fast Mode, and that was the UBA that served the RH11-C disk interface.

  Fast Mode write to memory:
    even word: accept 18-bit word from devices, store in buffer on UBA.
     odd word: combine new 18-bit word with previous, write 36 bits to mem.
  Fast Mode read from memory:
    even word: fetch 36 bit from memory, deliver 18 bit, keep other 18 in UBA.
     odd word: take 18-bit word from UBA buffer, deliver to device.

Nitpick:  looking at the RH11AB prints, it appears that it too had 18-bit
data paths (I think using PA/PB just like the RH11C).

Anyway I agree that the M7294-M7294YA substitution appears to be the only
(non-jumper) difference between the AB and the C.  The other boards seem
to all be vanilla...

Not quite everyone yearned to have their initials in that SUBTTL line. Very 
few of the sources I mucked about in got a "/JE" appended. I figured it was 
just another way customers could find out who to pester about their favorite 
bugs/dreams.

When I had left DEC and came back as an ADP employee to port TOPS-10 to the 
KS10, I put my initials in every module I touched. I figured as an ADP 
employee I was safe from the entreaties of DEC customers, so I'd make up for 
all those years of hiding my identity. Unfortunately, when the KS10 line of 
development was SOUPed back into the mainstream development sources (perhaps 
by you, Barb?) the person who resolved the conflicts didn't chose to preserve 
my initials. Sigh! ;-)

I've just emailed Pat offering to help, since I wrote the MBA/RH11/RM03-RP06 
code for TOPS-10. As I said in my email to him, it might help if I had access 
to a set of CREF listings of the monitor. Are they available anywhere still??

There's not much to the RH11 itself, since most of the time its job is
just to pass register accesses through to the selected drive (naturally the
address bits go through a ROM so the device registers come out in somewhat
scrambled order).  The only description I found of an RH that wasn't full
of inaccuracies is the one in the PDP-11/70 Processor Handbook (which of
course is actually for the RH70, but from a software point of view the only
difference there is the extra BAE register and the fact that DMA is direct
to memory and doesn't go through the Unibus map).

The most annoying thing I ran into (in doing the RH11/RH70 emulation in E11)
was in the fact that the interrupt behavior isn't documented correctly, I
had to go to the prints to understand it.  I'm not sure they did what they
did on purpose, since it acts differently from almost all other PDP-11
peripherals.

I might as well just clip out the comment block from E11's CS1 handler since
it explains what I figured out:

;		and RDY are both also set.
; TRE	RCL	Transfer error (set by leading edge on OR of DLT, UPE, NXD/NXF,
;		NXM, PGE, MSX, MDP).  Writing 1 clears all RH errors (TRE, MCP,
;		bits 8-15 of RHCS2), as does writing a data xfr cmd (5X, 6X,
;		7X) and GO to RHCS1, or writing 1 to CCLR.
; MCPE	RO	Massbus control bus parity error (while reading drive reg).
; X*	RO	Not used, but comes from drive (0 in practice).
; DVA*	RO	Drive available, unit selected by CS2 exists and is powered on.
;		(Dual-ported drives or single-port drives converted to dual-

; PSEL	RW*	Port select (0=Unibus A, 1=Unibus B).  RO while RDY clear.
;		We have only one Unibus so this bit does nothing.
; BAE	RW*	Unibus address extension.  Cleared by CCLR.
;		*Locked against writes when RDY=0.
; RDY	RO	Ready for next data transfer cmd, causes int if IE=1.
; or,	WO	Causes immediate int if ones are written to both RDY and IE in
;		the same xfr, but doesn't actually change RDY and causes no
;		further action.
; IE	RW	Interrupt enable, cleared when int is acknowledged (really!).
; FUN*	RW	Function code, drive-specific.
; GO*	RW	Start function, cleared on completion.
; 
; *X, DVA, FUN, and GO bits are in drive, others are in RH.
;
; If a DATOB writes only the high byte, no Massbus register access occurs.
;
; The RH only gets personally involved in data transfer commands, i.e. opcodes
; 5X (write checks), 6X (writes), and 7X (reads).  Writing one of these clears
; RDY until it completes (I think this means when the drive drops OCC, the
; Massbus "data bus occupied" signal).  Opcodes 0X-4X pass through the RH to
; the drive regardless of whether RDY is set (for overlapped seeks, rewinds,
; etc.).
;
; If a data transfer command is written to RHCS1 when RDY=0 already, PGE, TRE,
; and SC are set and the command is not written over the Massbus.
;
; The interrupts are a little odd.  IE is the interrupt enable as usual, but it
; is automatically cleared each time the interrupt is acknowledged.  The
; leading edge of RDY copies IE to the INTR (int request) flip flop, which is
; also set by writing ones to both RDY and IE in the same write (note that this
; doesn't really alter RDY though), while the AND of SC, RDY, and IE drives the
; INTR REQ line directly, bypassing the flip flop.  Clearing IE doesn't clear
; the flip flop, but clearing SC will cancel a pending int if INTR wasn't also
; set.  Unlike other devices, setting IE when RDY is already set does not cause
; an immediate int.  How much of this behavior was actually intended?
;
;-
	regnam	rh11,<CS1>
mbcs1:	xor	dx,dx		;reg 0
[...]

Careful with the thing about writing ones to RDY and IE to force an interrupt;
some of the documentation makes it sound like this writes to RDY, but it
really is a read-only bit, this thing about writing ones is a special case
(an AND gate checks out the data written but doesn't store RDY) for forcing
an interrupt on an idle RH, RSTS uses it to auto-detect the RH vector and
I'm sure other OSes do too.

In E11 I chose to untangle the Massbus register numbers to get their real
values so the code would be easily reusable in case I ever get around to doing
a VAX-11/780 or KL10 emulator, where (unless I misunderstand) the registers
aren't gratuitously moved around like in the RH11.  I guess there's no need to
do that in a KS emulator, but in case you care, here's the little chart I made
for myself that shows the RH11 Unibus-CSR-to-Massbus-register relationships.
BTW, the register select is 5 signals (pairs really) on the Massbus, I don't
know of anything that uses more than 4 bits' worth (maybe the TU78?).

As I'm sure your documentation explains, the CS1 register is a mess because
bits 12 and 5:0 are on the drive but the other bits are in the RH11.  Other
registers are either one or the other.  BAE/CS3 are only on the RH70 so don't
worry about them.  Massbus has a 16-bit control bus and an 18-bit data bus,
which are completely separate (no wonder the cable is so thick!), so while
only one device can be doing a data transfer at any one time, drive register
accesses to any device are possible any time so any other drive(s) can be
doing non-data things (like spacing magtapes or seeking disks or whatever).
The RDY bit in CS1 only has to do with the current data transfer command,
other stuff is none of the RH's business, the drives report completion of
non-data commands using ATTN.  The TE16/TU45/TU77 in particular is unusually
ATTN-happy...

Actually, the M8629 comes from a DEC KS10 36-bit computer, not a PDP-11 at all.
Which actually makes it rarer, except that that particular board is one of
the easier ones to find (I've got piles of them, and aftermarket clones too,
in case anyone is reviving a KS and needs some), but some of the other CPU
boards (all of which are in the M861x and M862x range) are less common,
if you can find any of those please post and I'm sure you'll find a buyer.

I've been told that the KS10 memory system was actually designed before
the 16K DRAMs were available, they built the prototypes using 4K DRAMs and
trusted that the 16K ones would be out in time for the product release.
Nice move, they were right!  Another nice thing is that the memory controller
(MMC) is separate from the memory arrays (MMA), so all the ECC and refresh
stuff only had to be done once rather than duplicated for each board.  So
it could be very cheap to add memory (although I don't whether DEC passed the
cost savings on to customers)

This is certainly a nice feature I never though of. How were the refresh signals
passed from board to board? Just a normal flat cable? Mabye this is a dumb
question, but I've never seen one of these boards 8-(

The whole mess goes in a special card cage so the backplane is specially
wired to distribute everything properly.  The MMC goes in the left-most slot,
and you fill in MMAs towards the right (up to 8 total).  I guess DEC only
got into the "all slots are created equal" thing on their smaller machines,
like Omnibus PDP-8s, and MicroVAXen (where non-standard signals have to be
passed over the top of the boards using jumper blocks or ribbon cables).
They weren't at all shy about having wire wrap rat's nests in the backplanes
of their bigger machines, where each slot was made for one particular board.
Well it's certainly convenient having your UBAs and MMAs automatically fall
at the right addresses (because of per-slot device selects) w/o having to
mess with links or DIP switches or anything...

So, I'm going though the KS10 microcode sources, trying to figure out
how the micromachine works.  There are a few things I'm just not clear
on from what I have seen so far.

1)  What is the SCAD?  From what I've read to this point, it appears to
    be some type of ALU-like thing, with floating point?

2)  What do the SC and FE fields do?  They seem to have something to do
    with the SCAD?

3)  Is the representation of floating-point numbers in the microcode the
    same as the PDP-10 representation?  If not, then what do floating-
    point numbers look like in the microcode?

4)  How wide are the registers in the register file.  They seem to have
    bits numbered from -3 thru 36 - that would make them 40 bits wide?

5)  Does anyone have a data sheet for the AMD 2901?  I can't seem to
    find such a thing on-line.

Before you ask, yes, I am toying with the idea of emulating a KS10
at the microcode level - I figure a 500 MHz Athlon ought to be able
to run PDP-10 code that way at least as fast as a real KS10.  And
yes, I am somewhat insane, thanks for asking ... :-)

Thanks,
--Pat.

The 2901 chips 2901-2901A-2901B-2901C are a obsolete product.
I do have the data sheets on the 2901C version of the chip, but
only in paper form. The 2901 is 4 bit register/alu block. There
is 16 general registers as well as a Q register used as extension
register for bit shifting. There may be data sheets still on the
web for 16bit versions of the 2901 chip, but nobody uses bit slice any
more.

Short of getting a copy of any of several editions of AMD's long-gone
"Bipolar Microprocessors Databook", the best way to learn about the 2901
and its companion family is to get a copy of the book, "Bit-Slice
Microprocessor Design" by John Mick and James Brick, published by
McGraw-Hill in 1980, ISBN 0-07-041781-4.  Mick and Brick were 2900
family application engineering managers at AMD, and they collected and
edited all the 2900 family application notes into a 398 page book that
is an excellent tutorial, not only for the 2900 family, but for
bit-sliced and microprogrammed computer design in general.  The book
includes the complete designs for two 16-bit minicomputers, and is
fascinating reading.  New-old-stock 2901 chips are still available,
should anyone want 'em, from surplus places such as Alltronics, BG Micro
and Unicorn Electronics.

Xilinx offers an "Intellectual Property" product that builds a 2901 in one
of their FPGAs - they might have enough of a datasheet to get a reasonable
understanding of the parts.

Cypress and IDT (I think) both did 16bit wide versions of the 2901 (eg
cy7c9101) that were used fairly widely in bitslice controlled interface
board of cisco routers, relatively recently (say, up though a cisco-7000.)
(I'm not sure whether any of those are still sold, though, and I couldn't
find any online datasheets for them either...)

Also, if you can find it, the last fifth of "OSBORNE 16-Bit Microprocessor

Note that the BOOT that displays V4 (KSBOOT.EXE) is not the
same as BOOTM.  They're completely different critters.  The
BOOT is a rewrite of the old boot and should be doing things
more sensible (but the developer was not thinking about
emulation at the time).

So, if you need to take a look at its source, you need
to find the files that were shipped in the BOOT subdirectory
rather than the BOOTM subdirectory on the CUSP tape.  

However, Tim's areas have some consistency problems (not
Tim's fault, merely an effect of not ever having a complete
product ship) so I believe that anything taken before 7.03
will have to use the old BOOT (we called it BOOTS) rather
than that new BOOT.  

Spelling, including capitalization on TOPS10 was very 
important, so you really do need to pay attention to
files and docs that refer to stuff that is spelt slightly
different.

IIRC, this was a spot in ITS (in DSKDMP I think?) under KLH's KS10 emulator
(I heard about it but didn't see it), where it would start a disk I/O
transfer using a buffer which included the code currently being executed,
and then it would jump out of the way before the disk had a chance to start
DMAing stuff in.  But on an emulator, the easiest way to emulate disk I/O
is to suspend instruction execution do the entire I/O "instantaneously"
between instructions, so it would fill the whole buffer before the next
instruction was fetched.

Since it worked fine on real KS10s, this bug is the emulator's problem,
just like the thing you described with executing random data and living
to tell about it.  I had similar problems with my PDP-11 emulator, and
worked around them by putting in a queueing system so that most operations
of most devices can be delayed by a configurable # of instruction fetches
before that operation is begun (at which point it still may happen in a
flash, if it's to a file or device that's accessed using blocking I/O).
It's a big pain but this makes it possible to address the actual problem,
that the user code assumes it can always finish the last N instructions
before a particular spot, before there's any possibility that the device
will have completed (or even begun) the operation.

Anyway, although I've never finished a KS10 emulator, I've done plenty of work
on one and I really think that the instruction set *is* the main concern.
It's freakin' huge!!!  The paging and UMR and interrupt systems have to be
done right too, but they aren't all *that* complicated, at least on the KS.
Some of the devices will be tricky, especially the TU77 since the TM03
documentation is so full of nasty little omissions etc., but generally the
device support in the OSes for the KS10 is terrible so there just aren't
that many devices to worry about in the first place.

Do a TU77 and an RP06 and a DZ and you're practically there!  The KS10 OSes
don't support many of the other zillions of older PDP-11 disk/tape devices
that *would* have worked (the RK611 even has an 18-bit mode, and the RK11D
can be ECOed into an RK11E too), so you can skip all of those, and the KS10
didn't live long enough to really overlap with the newer PDP-11/VAX stuff
(no MSCP at all, and no DELUA, the DEUNA was around but drew too much current
to actually install one).  So you're off the hook for all that stuff too.

AFAIK no serial mux besides the DZ11 was ever officially supported on the KS10
(which is ironic because the KS10 CPU's backplane is actually made from a
DH11 PCB with different wire wrap!), there was the DUP11/KMC11 set that was
used for sync serial I/O but you're probably not going to get much call for
that on a Unix or Windows based emulator.  The DZ is dead easy, so really,
serial I/O is no biggie either.

Hello Folks:

I read all articles about this subject "PDP-10 Emulator".  Well, there are
existing PDP-10 emulators.   I was able to get my emulator to print "BOOT>"
prompt with KL paging system mode turned on.   My goal is print a dot.

I am writing my KS-10 emulator in progress and am implementing
RH11/TM02/TM03 interface and testing it.   I played with KSBOOT.EXE and it
worked so well and did not crash my emulator. :-)   I entered '/tm02' at a
BOOT> prompt and got result message - "No TM02 or TM03 drive" before I
started to implement my RH11 interface.

Yes, I will release my KS10 emulator under GPL license soon but I do not
know when yet.  Then, I will work on it to expand to KL10 emulator then
PDP6/KA10/KI10 later.   I learned that my monitor sources support KL10 too
but was compiled with KS10 default.  I got them from Tim's archives.  I know
that a sin (fear) controls some authors keep their emulators from people's
hands.

Indeed, my KS10 microcode sources, monitor sources, TOPS-10 sources and
other resources do help my KS10 emulator development so much.

While it's kind of fun to read my own code after all these years, now I'm not 
so sure MAPIO is the right place to find the relevant information. Perhaps I'm 
thinking about a routine originally written for the DC10 that I modified for 
the KS. :-)

Also went to the referenced web site and looked at the source. I noticed 
someone edited my name from the SUBTTL line in KSSER. Instead it reads DMCC 
(Dave McClure?) and DBD (Doug Detroy?). Sigh! :-(

Not sure quite what you mean by "addressing" here, but I'll blab a bit and
hopefully cover what you're really asking.

The Massbus is effectively in two pieces, one side does register accesses and
the other side is used for data transfer.  They're basically separate, even
though they run through the same big honking cable.  The register access side
is 16 bits wide (for compatibility with PDP-11s etc., you don't want to have
bits that some hosts can't reach), and the data transfer side is 18 bits wide
(only 16 of which are used in the 16-bit modes, again to make PDP-11s happy).

So, the frame count register is 16 bits wide, and so are all the other
visible registers in the TM02/03 or the RP06 DCL or the RMxx "RM adapter".
The RH11C is *almost* a standard PDP-11 controller, I can't find my printset
and don't have a machine set up to test but I'm 99% sure that even when used
with 18-bit Unibus, the RHBA and RHWC registers are still 16 bits wide and you
have to use the BA extension bits in RHCS1 (or anyway, *one* of the extension
bits, since the UBA's map covers only the low half of the Unibus space).

The disk data are transferred via DMA and since the disks are formatted
with 18-bit data, there's no re-packing required as with 8-bit tape data,
so the 18-bit words come across the Massbus and through the Unibus w/o
being messed up.  Then the UBA handles the KS10 memory transfer, optionally
collecting two halfwords into an entire word before performing DMA (for
"fast" mode), but it can do them individually (it looks like writing to
memory destroys the whole word for the first byte/halfword in a word, but
the others are done using read-modify-write).

Up to eight tape formatters (TM02, TM03, ?TM78?) on a Massbus.
Up to eight tape transports on a formatter.

I think the TM02 only supports 800 bpi (and perhaps 200 and 556 on 7-track?),
whereas the TM03 supports 800 and 1600.  But I don't know for sure because
all my drives are on TM03s, and I don't have TM02 docs.

Yes.

Theoretically possible.  Not done in practice.  Might work on some
operating systems, but most don't support it.  It certainly isn't
supported on the KS10.

Yup.

I don't have my RH11, RH20, RH70, or RH780 prints handy, but it's certainly
the case that the registers that are local to the Massbus interface
have basically the same function for both discs and tapes.  This follows
logically from the fact that the Massbus interface doesn't really *know*
which kind of device it's talking to.

Note that the Massbus controllers present the registers to the host
computer at relative addresses that are almost unrelated to the
address on the bus.  So if you compare the addresses in a device manual
with those used by software, you'll certainly get confused.  I've
never figured out why they did this; it seems completely arbitrary
and unhelpful.

If memory serves, the register addressing/mapping is done by a PROM
on some of the Massbus interfaces, and by hardwired logic in others.

Seems crazy to me too.  However, I don't think this happens all the time;
IIRC, on the RH780, the registers appear in actual physical order, and I
think maybe on the RH20 too (picked through the prints at one point).  The
RH11 and RH70 mix it all up (fortunately the same as each other at least),
in case anyone cares, this is the mapping (using 776700 as the base addr):

Unibus	Massbus	Name(s)
======	=======	=======
776700	00	CS1
776706	05	DA/FC
776712	01	DS/FS (RO)
776714	02	ER/ER1 (RO)
776716	04	AS (shared in all drives, presumably parity is ignored)
776720	07	LA/CC (RO)
776724	03	MR/MR1
776726	06	DT (RO)
776730	10	SN (RO)
776732	11	OF/TC
776734	12	DC
776736	13	HR/CC
776740	14	MR2/ER2 (RO if ER2)
776742	15	ER2/ER3 (RO)
776744	16	EC1 (RO)
776746	17	EC2 (RO)
776750	20	IA
776752	21	ID

Note that Massbus has 5 address bits but most devices fit in 4.  Naturally
there has to be an exception -- the TU78 has 18 regs.  ILR sets if you touch
a nonexistent reg.

Also, before I forget -- the RH11 works very differently with data transfer
vs. non-data-transfer commands.  The READY bit in RHCS1 only has to do with
data transfer commands, which are opcodes 51-77, and are assumed to use the
data half of the bus (and thus DMA through BA and WC).  Only one of those
can be outstanding at a time, which is why the controller has a centralized
READY bit to cover it.  But the register half of the Massbus is never tied
up, so you can poke drive regs any time (although you'll get an RMR error
from the drive if you write one of its regs while it's busy with something).
The non-data-transfer commands all indicate completion with attentions.

I'm not sure about *all* the differences, but the two I have noted down are:

* bit 5 of drive type register is 1 on TM03, 0 on TM02 (just for ID)

* bit 13 of TC reg is "SAC" (slave address change) on TM03, and it's set
  any time the slave select bits change.  but it's TCW (tape control write)
  on TM03, and sets any time the reg is written (even if the slave select
  bits are unchanged).  I kind of think I remember this having some side-effect
  on some delay somewhere, which doesn't need to be restarted if it's the
  same slave, but IIRC that's the formatter's business and nothing that
  you need to emulate.

Definitely true.

>Yes, CS3

The CS3 and BAE registers appear only on the RH70, not the RH11, so don't
worry about this.  And it's not exactly a tape vs. disk distinction;  the
rule is, CS3 and BAE are jumpered to immediately follow the *last* existing
Massbus register, so it differs between disks and tapes only because they
have a different number of registers.  But it also differs between RS03/04
fixed-head disks (which have only 8 regs in the drive) and the RPxx/RMxx
pack drives (which have 16).

>That's why I am figuring out to implement routines to access local and drive
>registers for mixed tape and disk drives per same MASSBUS controller.

Yeah, you just need to split out which regs are in the RH and which are
in the formatter or drive.  CS2, WC, BA, and the maintenance data buffer
register are on the RH, so you don't have to mess with per-drive data there
(it's OK if the currently selected drive doesn't even exist).  CS1 is
half-and-half so you OR together the values on reads, and distribute the
bits accordingly on writes.  Everything else goes to Massbus regs in the
currently selected drive.

I'd forgot to mention - I think the CD11 is a card reader?  I don't
know how something like that would get into a network module, or
if you found it in a different place ... the PDP-11 Field Guide
lists an M7249 module as "CD11 Hollerith Check (Multiple ones
error detector)", which gives me even more confidence that it
is, in fact, a card reader.

there was a cr11, like the cr8e, program interrupt device.
there was a KG11, prior to the 2652 and SMC5025 chips with CRC check

You have to remember that the KS10 was designed for ADP to run
TOPS10.  It is quite possible that an installation from scratch
was never done for the V4.0 release.  The KS that we had was
rarely used by the -20 monitor group so any work done on the
KS part of TOPS-20 probably started with a disk pack that 
was ready to run rather than a blank one.  Somehow a niggle
in my head is saying that a new KS system that was shipped
to a customer came with a disk that was ready made for 
running.  If that was the case, then the manufacturing guys
were the ones who built it.  And I can tell you from experience
that those guys were not methodical _at all_.  My last triumph
was getting the contents of the KLAD pack out of their hands.

One of the side effects of not shipping sources is that the
source tape will not match the general distribution tape.
That was true with the -20 ships until management finally
figured out that an engineer should be designing the build
and packaging procedures.  That was another accomplishment
of mine.  There was a gap after Alan Frantz left that 
non-engineer types did all the decision making for the
packaging on both the -10 and -20.

Remember, Barb, that the KS10 had a REMOTE DIAGNOSIS switch with three
positions:
  DISABLE = Ignore RD, CD, RI and all other signals from the KLINIK line.
  ENABLE  = Allows free acces to the system without password protection.
	    This is like the KL KLINIK; the lines wired in parallel.
  PROTECT = Allows access to the system with a password.
	There was a separate command you had to type on the console
	to tell the 8080 front end what the password was.  When the FE
	called up the modem connected to the KLINIK line, he would be
	asked for the password.  If it matched, the KLINIK line would
	be connected to the console.  If it did not match the line would
	be an ordinary terminal line.

I forget now whether the line was CTY+1 or CTY-1, but it did allow
logging in as a "normal" user (such as [6,6] or [6,10]).

Now that I'm thinking about it, I recall that when we got the KS10's,
the only thing that ran on them was TOPS-20. (this was before I
worked there by a year or two). Of course, we were a TOPS-10
shop, so that was unacceptable.

I asked a co-worker, and learned that my future boss used the 
existing KA10 to hack the 6.03 binaries so they would boot on a KS10. 

As soon as he could boot 6.03, he altered the sources accordingly and
recompiled.

I don't think we ever had a "real" distribution tape for 6.03...

I'm not sure how much he had to do to get it working, but I seem to
remember a "KSSER.MAC", which doesn't exist in the 6.03 archives.
I believe he stole the KLSER.MAC and modified to fit... how hard
would it be to get a KS10 running hacked KL sources? Would you
need "tops-10" paging? :)

That's the way it happened at BOCES III in Dix Hills... the Ks10's
would run TOPS-20, not -10, and they had to MAKE it work.

I doubt it - the only TOPS-20 we had was the "red" diagnostic pack.

I did a complete inventory of all tapes around 5 years after the KS10's
came in - I never found the 6.03 monitor tapes, nor anything else, but
a copy of the KS10 Diagnostics - which I think is the same as the one
on Tim Shoppa's site.

We did have an RP06 that came straight from DEC with the 6.03 monitor
on it. Boy, did we protect that pack with our lives!

There was a discussion when Tim Stark first started his emulator,
about the need for TOPS-10 paging vs TOPS-20 paging. Apparently
there are versions of KS10 microcode for each.

Maybe since ADP needed to run TOPS-10 on them, they needed TOPS-10
paging - 7.0x TOPS-10 (I think) uses TOPS-20 paging. (whatever
that means!). 

For all I know, ADP helped my boss to fix up 6.03 to run...
Office gossip/history is a misleading mother... 

And, back to my original question... how much hacking would it 
really take to get 6.03 running on a KS10? If you had to choose
KA, KI or KL, which platform is closest to the KS and what would
you steal to make it work?

You were there and I wasn't, but I never heard that the KS was "built for
ADP".  What I heard was that it was ONLY going to support TOPS-20, until
ADP insisted that it must run TOPS-10 (and did the port, IIRC).

After all, the KS10 is part of a DECSYSTEM-2020.  It's not part of
a DECsystem-10xx for any value of xx.  This suggests that it was not
planned to run TOPS-10.

I recently learned that SC built a custom replacement memory system
for the KS10, in order to build SMP systems!

Right.  If anything it would have been 6.03A.  You must not have
paid a maintenance fee.

And that sounds like a KLAD.  The only RP06 disk pack we shipped
was a KLAD and it didn't have "modern" software until I stamped
my foot at manufacturing.

And, from what you tell me, your site got everything from under

I thought I did answer it.  My manpower estimate (which was always
shy by 300%) is 3 man years to hack; 2 man years for monitor
debugging; 5 man years to retrofit the CUSPs.


>If you had to choose

I wouldn't steal any.  I would copy a KS save set from Shoppa's
archive.  6.03 had great problems.  That why we made 7.01.  And
I certainly wouldn't want to have to deal with FAILSA <yech>,
MPB <ptui> and the absence of VTTECO, MIC, SET W F, PATH, and
the FILDAE.

Tim, are you just trying to get LPT output routed to a printer, or are you 
committed to emulating devices as originally configured by DEC? I'm asking, 
because it seems to me emulating an LP11 would be easier than an LP20. While 
DEC never released a KS-10 with an LP11, while I was with ADP all of our LPT 
support was via LP11s. The LP11 device service routine, while not on any DEC 
release tapes, may still be available from sources I am still in touch with.

BTW, even while I was porting TOPS-10 to the KS, using an LP20 never made any 
sense to me. Because of the "NUXI problem" one had to manipulate the output 
stream a byte at a time to get it into an order that made sense to the UBA for 
a DMA transfer to the LP20. I seemed to me that if you had to handle the data 
a byte at a time anyway it was just as efficient (more efficient?) to simply 
ship it to a "byte at a time" device like the LP11. Besides, the LP11 was a 
lot cheaper than an LP20.

For this reason, the LP20 service routine was one of the few pieces of the 
KS-10 implentation I wasn't responsible for. Doug Detroy implemented that 
module.

   Didn't the dispatch table get loaded with the standard microcode?
Have a look at the microcode on Tim Shoppa's site to see it that's
the case.  I suspect, but cannot prove, it is.

   This was probably used for process accounting.  If I recall it
correctly, the actual job scheduler used the line-clock.

   I'll see if I can scrape up enough time between shovelling
excursions to take a gander at the KS u-code.

IIRC, the KS10 DROM is an honest-to-god ROM.  Which is one of the problems
if you want to have fun with hacked microcode, I think a bunch of invalid
opcodes all point to the same address so there's no way to tell them apart
w/o requiring a different DROM.

That can't be right, unless the dispatch table is in the CRAM.  When I
microcoded my KS, it was done entirely with DC commands.

The KS10 ucode destination control != the 2901's idea of a dest code.

Here's the translations.  I think this is correct.

KS10 DEST		2901 DEST		NOTE

0			2			RAMFILE = F, Y = A
1			3        		RAMFILE = F, Y = F
2			0			Q = F, Y = F

Barb's right.  On the KS, however, the 8080 did sneak in and diddle with
the RH11's registers behind the 2020's back.  The data stored in SMFILE.SYS
was formatted to make life easier for the 8080.

Musta been version 5. I worked with 5.06 for a year before the KA was
"upgraded" to five KS10's that ran 6.03 that included SFD's, but not this
QUASAR/PULSAR/ORION stuff.

Yeah, there is a lot of that - it's a natural thing over the life of on OS
that has gone through 7 major revisions. Different people working on it
like something their way - so to add the "/NOFOO" switch that they want
to use, they go hack SCAN(?) to allow "/NO...". Meanwhile, it already
supports "/FOO:NO" ...

No problem there... I was just getting your opinion so I could look at
it from your perspective. On my boot disk for TOPS-10 7.03 under TS10, I
disabled some of the daemons already :)

I have a copy of a TOPS-10 6.03A SYSTEM.EXE that ran on a KS10. I plan
on getting a 6.03A version of TOPS-10 to run under TS10. You'd be welcome
to it if I ever get it off the ground.

I'm not very familiar with TOPS-20, except as a hacker ("break and enter"
type). It struck me as being clean and straightforward, although a little
bloated for my taste. It was a pig compared to TOPS-10 in terms of memory
use (?).

Just answered my own question, from the 703MIG:


6.2.1 Creating a Front-end File System Directory Area

If you are installing a new KS system, you must create a directory
area on disk for the microprocessor file system. This area must be
[6,2020], and it is recommended that you use the structure that
resides on RPA0. Do not use a multiple-unit file structure for the
microprocessor file system.

The last work item on my ITS list is the 1-proceed capability.  It is
rather complicated, so I wanted to check out my understanding of its
operation, as derived from the KS10 microcode.

[An initial question: did ITS require it for operation?  The ITS KS10
microcode is conditionalized for three features: PC sampling,
1-proceed, and jump PC (JPC).  The first two are enabled, the third is
not.]

1-proceed is PC flag<8> (reuse of address inhibit).  It can only be
set by a "traditional" style JRSTF or JEN.  (The ITS KS10 microcode
still has the extended JRSTs but doesn't check for 1-proceed in those
code paths.)

If set, 1-proceed allows the next instruction to execute but then
causes a trap through UPT 432/433.  The instruction being
"1-proceeded" executes as though PC flag<8> was clear; that is, if it
is flag-saving jump, PC flag<8> will be clear.  There are special
cases:

- If the instruction following the "1-proceeded" instruction page
faults on fetch, the page fault is supressed and the 1-proceed trap
occurs instead.  [Because the KS10 prefetches the next instruction,
normally page faults normally occur before traps.]

- If the instruction being "1-proceeded" faults during execution, the
page fault PC flags will have the 1-proceed flag set, so that when
execution is retried, the 1-proceed trap will occur.

- If an interrupt occurs while the "1-proceed" instruction is
executing, the interrupt PC flags (for JSR, not for XPCW) will have
the 1-proceed trap flag set.

The KS10 implements this feature entirely through internal state
flags.  When a JRSTF or JEN with flags<8> set is seen, an internal
flag, FLG.1PROC is set (flags<8> is not set in the hardware).  During
decode, an extra check is put in to test for FLG.1PROC.  If set, then
another internal flag, FLG.2PROC, is checked.  If FLG.2PROC is clear,
it is set, and normal execution occurs.  If FLG.2PROC is set, the
1-proceed trap is sprung, and both FLG.1PROC and FLG.2PROC are
cleared.

The interrupt JSR and page fault handlers check FLG.1PROC and, if it
is set, set flags<8> in the save flags word.

The fetch trap handler checks FLG.2PROC and, if it is set, takes the
1-proceed trap instead.

Comments welcome.

On further reflection, I think that the KS10's implementation is
broken.

On the KS10, FLG.1PROC and FLG.2PROC are supposed to work rather like
the VAX T and TP bits.  FLG.1PROC (VAX T) is checked after interrupts
and traps are processed; if set, it sets FLG.2PROC (VAX TP) to trigger
the trap before the next instruction.  For the KS10 (not the VAX), the
problem is that FLG.2PROC is checked at the same point that FLG.1PROC
is checked - after interrupts and traps, not before.  Imagine this
scenario:

n-1/	set FLG.1PROC via JRSTF
n/	fetch
	check FLG.1PROC/2PROC; 1PROC set, hence set 2PROC
	execute
n+1/	interrupt... 1-proceed set in saved flags
	:
	JRSTF from interrupt
n+1/	fetch
	check FLG.1PROC/2PROC; 1PROC set, hence set 2PROC
n+2/	fetch
	check FLG.1PROC/2PROC; 2PROC set, hence trap

The 1-proceed trap at the end of instruction n has been missed.  This
is because the state of 2PROC is not saved (no equivalent to VAX TP).
To make this work, 2PROC would need to be checked BEFORE interrupts
and traps, not after.

No, no, no.  You guys are not following all the steps in the MIG.

All real KS-2020's have the same serial number until SMFILE is run.

Zane's "TOPS-10 v7.03 Install Proceedure" left out one important step.

To repeat, the customer is supposed to set the serial number immediately
after reading in the microcode file (before writing CRAM).

Ouch... and for whom ? :)

For the longest time, and I was the one hacking the monitor for the
site consisting of 5 KS10's running 6.03, I thought it was plain 6.03.

I found an installation monitor for 6.03A living as SYS000.EXE
in an old system backup, AFTER the logical end-of-tape on a 1/2"
personal backup I had...

Now, I am convinced it was 6.03A, since I have checked some other 
backups I had made, and they plainly state 6.03A.

It's been fun... again, ANYONE HAVE 6.03A for KS10? ? ? huh, please?

Don't ask why, I'm just nostalgic... if I could, I'd love to run
TOPS10 5.06 on a KA10 again ... I once got a view of it through a
window...

Please use a real email address when asking questions.

The answer to your question is that even a single RM03 is sufficient to
build a workable KS10 system.  However, the controller on the RM03 needs
to be wired to allow 18bit transfers.  Unlike RM05s, the controllers on
many RM03s, even those sold for PDP-11 systems, are wired appropriately.
It's just a couple of jumpers as I recall.

You will, of course, need to format the disks using the KSFORM magtape.
If the disk won't format, it may need the rewriting.

It's the only way KSes got on the net.  I can't remember what
Bill called the monitor files.  They should be in the monitor
sources somewhere...LATSER?  I can't remember if we unbundled
the monitor sources for DECnet.  If we did, they would be on
the DECnet tape in the monitor save set.  If we didn't, they
would be on the monitor tape, first save set.  (ANF-10 was the
second save set.)  Also this is info about how I packaged 7.03;
I have no idea how they botched the 7.04 ship.

The power supply in my HP 88780 1/2" tape drive died last night. It's going to 
be difficult to make tapes for the KS10 now.

The KS10 didn't like the KERMIT tape. It read the label OK but said that the 
data wasn't in backup format.

Just for yucks I entered 2002 as the year when the KS10 booted. It showed a 
date of 102, reported parity errors, and then said that the RP06 had multiple 
logical units on it. It rebooted just fine with a pre-Y2K date.

TOPS-20 had minimal Y2K issues; the most notable being that the DECnet
stuff broke (big surprise).

KS10 hardware neither knows, nor cares, about years.  Time is only kept as
an uptime and an OS-interpreted boot time.

I might try stringing serial cables over from the SPARCstation-10 and the PC today.

I have a KMC11. If I can find a DUP11 and a synchronous serial Q-bus board then I can 
connect the KS10 to the VAX 3540 which has Ethernet to the SPARCstation-10 which can 
dial to the Internet. If I load DECNET on the KS10 then you could telnet to the 
SPARCstation, telnet to the VAX 3540, and SET HOST to the KS10.

The other possibility is to install the DEUNA and get DECNET or TCP/IP working over 
Ethernet.

Relative speed? It's REEEALY SLOOOW. I can't believe how slow a file copy is.

There are a number of files describing the DECsystems at RCS/RI and
images of the systems on our "works in progress" website:

http://starfish.osfn.org/rcs/DECsystem/


Also see:

http://starfish.osfn.org/rcs/2020/images/

But these are of poor quality.  They were taken about a year ago when we
were checking out the hardware.

I started working on the master TU45. Both the power supply and the servo 
control board have problems. I will pick up replacements on Monday.

I formatted another RP06 pack and installed TOPS10 7.03 on it. I still can't 
make a distribution tape so I haven't customized the TOPS kernel. I might try 
installing TOPS20 or ITS on a pack next week.

I now have a KMC11 and a DUP11 for the KS10 and I have a VAX that talks DECnet. 
If I can find a synchronous serial Qbus board and a synchronous null-modem then 
I should be able to get the KS10 to talk to the VAX.

I also have an Ethernet board for the KS10. That should be an interesting 
project...

Have a merry Christmas.

Then remove it.  You don't really need 32 serial lines on a KS, do you?
Why waste the power on something that you won't use?  I recommend that you
remove all but one working DZ and keep the other two working DZs as
spares.

I forget if you are using TOPS-10 or TOPS-20.  In TOPS-20 you have to
configure the serial port through a SETSPD file that is read at startup.
Presumably you have to do much the same on TOPS-10.

Beware of 9600 baud lines.  Neither the DZ nor the KS can keep up with a
lot of 9600 baud activity.

Yes, if the PDP-11 is talking synchronous protocol to the DUP.

No.

DECnet is the only thing that any KS monitor supports for the KMC/DUP.
DEC distributed Phase II DECnet with TOPS-20 4.1, but I got Phase IV
working under contract to them (TOPS-20 4.2).  I have the files necessary
to upgrade TOPS-20 4.1 sources to TOPS-20 4.2.  Although the result works,
it's kind of a toy.  You have to use *really* small packets (376 bytes).

KS10 #4469 has been moved from my mother's house to my current
residence. The machine was removed intact, but we abandoned the TU45
there as it was unrepairable and we have nowhere to put it here.

It's currently in the garage - We're trying to get pulleys and so on
to move it into the house or at least the basement, but worst-case
scenario we plan to wrap the machine in blankets and plastic bags and
hope the cold temperature doesn't do too much damage.

Plans are to try hacking the PDP11 MSCP disk controller (Viking UDT,
MSCP on the UNIBUS end and SCSI on the other end) into working with
TOPS10 or TOPS20, assuming I can get the system into the basement
where I can work on it.

FWIW, I finally tracked down the serial number of my 2020: MR04553
