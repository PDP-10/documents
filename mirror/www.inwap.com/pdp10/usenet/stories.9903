I hope that I got the meunomic right!  Anyway, I heard years ago
that a bug was found in the KI-10, where a double floating divide of
the form:

		DFDIV	AC,AC+1

	Would hang the machine so badly that you had to physically power
cycle it to get it back.  The problem was like this:

1)	The machine started the divide cycle, and found that AC+1, the 
second half of the floating point number in AC, was not normalized; it
normalized it.

2)	The machine stepped to AC+1, the first half of the second argument;
found that it was not now normalized; it normalized it.

3)	The machine restarted at step 1.  Endless loop.

	I understand that the problem was easily corrected via a harware
ECO, but I was curious as to how the machine behaved after thie bug was
fixed.

I think this is the bug that was discovered at Essex University (in the
UK!?!?) sometime in 1979-80. I do recall that some fun was had by our
computing department asking several other '10 sites around the country
if they could "just run this little job for us" and then getting a call
back saying something on the lines of: "sorry we can't run your job our
system just died..." (OK they probably warned them first... but it makes
a better story the other way! 8-})
Cheers,
Roy

   As well as they should have. The final shutdown of any machine
(with a few exceptions ;-)) deserves a solemn ceremony.

   The drop speed may give a hint as to the machine type. If it
dropped the full 9 degrees in an hour (with the AC running at rated
capacity) it was probably a KL-10; if 2 hours, it may have been a
KI.

   What is the fate of the machine? I've been known to do stupider
things than ship iron cross-continent.

According to an RFP from 1993 (for a replacement system), this was a 1091 PA,
with 3 RP06 and 3 RP07 drives, 2 TU78 tapes, and a DN20.

A 1091 is a KL with MOS memory, isn't it?  (I grew up in the orange world ;-)

This sounds about as weird as what I was told was done at RPI before
I got there, supposedly early versions of the MTS operating system (for
IBM mainframes) didn't support floating point (i.e. FP context was
not saved/restored between tasks), so people had some fun with token-
passing protocols using the FP registers for IPC.  Later there was a
CB program that used scratch files for IPC, what hell, but that's what
you get stuck with on an OS whose whole goal in life is to separate
tasks from each other.

Well, for a KA, about a thousand of the single-height B-21n series boards, (I
forget what the digit for n is, only that they were the ones that burned until
the original pair of resistors were replaced with 2 to 5 watt jobs) and a few
thousand more R,W,B,and G-series discreet transistor and negative-logic
ultra-low-scale IC boards, most of which have unfortunately been ground up for
scrap, 1000 pounds of power supplies, lots of little core rings and the
patience to string them, unless you can find a few core boxes still around. A
KA-10 basic CPU was three 24"(? maybe more) x 6' racks of these things. A
36-bitx250K-word core box ran the same size.

You'll also need several tons of air conditioning, a rather large room, and an
awful lot of old DEC backplane and a steady hand with a wire wrap gun to
handle about four miles of pin-to-pin wiring without error (DEC had automated
the process by 1965)

It could be worse, you could be planning on building s PDP-6, which used
modules with about twice the surface area per gate and some specialized
modules that were notoriously unreliable.

Oh, yes, I would absolutely love an intact KA-10 and a place to play with it,
not to mention the money to run the thing and cool down the room.

But building one from scratch ranks up there with repairing steam locomotives
while underway as tasks that are theoretically possible, though not very
desirable.

We at XKL LLC find that we are in greater need of computer room floor space
than we are of a KL10/B and a disk farm.  We will therefore entertain offers
to provide a working home for this venerable beast.  Otherwise, it's going
to be stripped for spare boards and RP07 HDAs by a broker.

This is a "you take it away" offer:  We will not ship the system, though we
may provide some help in de-installing it.

The system is configured as follows:

  KL10 Model B processor with MCA25 cache and 4MW MOS memory
  (orange FCC cabinetry, three double-wide bays)

  4 RP06 disk drives (two in use, two spares) -- dual ported for -11/-10 access
  7 RP07 disk drives
  4 TU78 tape drives (two in use, two spares)
  Network interface is a MEIS (MASSBUSS-Ethernet Interface Subsystem)
  Two LA120 consoles

  Tops-20 version 7.0 with Stanford mods (Ethernet access and such)

We will accept offers until 31 January 1998, to allow for slow propagation of
the news of this offer to interested parties.  We reserve the right to make a
decision before that time, if an acceptable offer is made early.

Please send e-mail containing offers to

  KL-giveaway -at XKL.COM

(where -at is RFC733-speak for the "commercial at" symbol you'll really use).

Nope.  By then I was at Alliant and delivered an FX/8
to a room full of DEC-10 stuff.  Looked like a museum.
Len Bosack gave me a tour.  Their KA-10 was used rarely;
the sole purpose for keeping it was to read an occational
paper tape.

I'm still friends with Mike and Stew and will see them
again MLK Jr weekend when I'm in Reno to play in a
SCRABBLE tournament.

The crew when I was there was Mike, Stew, Jack Holloway,
and Fred plus me as #5.  I left before Pete Samson started.
I knew him from TMRC in Cambridge when he was at MIT and I
was at DEC but never worked with him at SC or anywhere else.

I missed those. The last -10 I know of was a triple processor KL
configuration at British Airways, Heathrow. I saved one processor in
~93-94, when it was switched off. Rest was scrapped. Didn't get any
memory as 1. it was Ampex, not DEC, and 2. It had too much gold and
the scrapman had counted all the cabinets twice!

The 2020 was at Robert Gordons University, Aberdeen, I rescued that in
~94-95. Got the whole system - RP06s, TU45s, a load of disk packs.

The 15 was an XVM system rescued from British Aerospace, Warton, last
year, where it had been used on the Tornado hydraylic test rig.

Unless anyone knows different these were the last 18 and 36 bit
machines operational in the UK. What I would dearly love to know is
what became of the last KI, which was removed from the Scottish
Special Housing Association in Edinburgh in the mid-80s. It was
dismantled - with DEC assistance - and taken away by a guy who was
trying to start up 'The Scottish Computing Museum' - and never seen or
heard of again! Anyone got any suggestions or more info?

At the Colorado School of Mines, we used the PDP-8 terminal scanner
as our read-in device.  Our disk configuration was not suitable for
use as the read-in device, the PDP-8 would send a short bootstrap
program that did know how to talk to the disks.

OK, here it is.  The log files below have moved with me from account to
account over the years, but I believe that I originally found them
on MC.LCS.MIT.EDU in 1987 or so.  These files were widely circulated
at the time; I was extremely surprised to not be able to find them
on the web today.  I suppose the point-and-click generation simply
doesn't care about anything that happened over a decade ago - which
is too bad, as there's a fascinating amount of history contained
in the the attached file.

                HOW JERRY POURNELLE GOT KICKED OFF THE ARPANET



   This file explains why Jerry Pournell <POURNE@MIT-MC.ARPA (ex-tm)> is
   no longer on the ARPANet. It's in chronological order. I hope this
   clears up any misunderstanding and confusion that may exist.

   Hi,

   I didn't see your original messages, and I don't know how the NIC got
   into the loop, but I am indeed the person to answer your questions.

   Apparently you have encountered TAC access control (TACACS) on your
   favorite MILNET TAC. TACACS is a login system based on encrpytion
   codes recorded on little paper cards which authorized MILNET TAC users
   are being issued. To be a MILNET TAC user, you must have a personal
   TACACS account and be issued one of these cards, so that you can type
   your login code to the TAC and make it happy. People establish TACACS
   accounts and get cards by contacting me to get registered.

   If you stick to using ARPAnet TACs, you will have no trouble, since
   TACACS for the ARPAnet is going to be a little different and has not
   been completely figured out yet.

   MIT is not sponsoring guest/tourist usage of the MILNET; if you are a
   guest, you should just switch to using a TAC on the ARPAnet and avoid
   the problem. I can provide you the name of an ARPAnet TAC in your
   area, but I cannot authorize you to use it or provide you with
   telephone dialup numbers.

   I will soon have some "Guest TACACS cards" for authorized MIT people
   on our machines who need to use a MILNET TAC but have not yet been
   registered for their own personal cards. These cards are confusingly
   named: they have nothing to do with guest accounts and are not
   available to tourists/guests.

   To put it straight: in general, you are up a creek, and there really
   isn't very much to be done about it. Feel free to ask me further
   questions or whatever though.

   Cheers, Chris

   You used the word "ARPANET" in your June Byte column three times. You

   "I gave Alex the local ARPANET access number to record for the

   USER-A is the mailing list created explicitly for dealing with these
   sorts of issues. It is the appropriate forum for discussion. There are
   eight people on user-a. You probably know better than I do, but last I
   heard about 100,000 times as many people read BYTE. Thus, the issue of
   privacy is the last one you should raise.

   I don't particularly want to force you into ritual disembowelment;
   rather, I'm interested -- and I'm not the only one -- in why you find
   it necessary to flaunt your use of the arpanet. The more attention you
   (and other people) draw to non-blow-em-up use of the arpanet the more
   likely some Proxmire type is to start inquiring into its operations.

   Personally, I'd just turn off his account. It's not like it's the
   first time, and he not only flaunts his use of our machines but stabs
   us in the back with grumblings about why he doesn't like this or that
   program of ours when he gets a chance. (Am thinking particularly of an
   article he wrote which condemned Lisp for reasons amounting to little
   more than his ignorance, but which cited Teach-Lisp in a not-friendly
   light... The man has learned nothing from his presence on MC and sets
   a bad example of what people might potentially accomplish there. I'd
   rather recycle his account for some bright 12-yr-old...)

Re:   WESTERCON 38 and The Pournelle/ARPANET Split



   We attended the WESTERCON 38 SF convention held in Sacramento, CA,
   over the July 4th weekend. At WESTERCON we talked with Jerry Pournelle
   about why he never contributed to the SF-LOVERS bb since he had an
   account at MIT-MC. He said his account at MIT-MC was terminated by
   some "graduate student" in charge of accounting, who felt he did not
   have a need for an account. He knows who this "graduate student" is,
   and he refuses to grovel so that his account is reinstated. However,
   he asked us to broadcast this little story - presumably so that MIT-MC
   will come to him.

   BTW - if you ever get a chance to meet Jerry Pournelle, you will not
   be dissappointed. Sequel to FOOTFALL:-)

   HARPANET FOR PRESIDENT,

   HUSENET FOR VICE-PRESIDENT.

   Also planned is a sequel (and a prequel) to THE MOTE IN GOD'S EYE.
   WESTERCON 38 was run very well. In addition to Jerry, we spent several
   hours talking with Greg Bear, Norman Spinrad, Robert Adams, James P.
   Hogan, Larry Niven, John Brunner, and David Brin.

   You might consider contacting Byte about publishing some note from us

   pournelle is going to say what I think he is going to say (what JMC
   told me pournelle was claiming), which is that the reason his account
   was flushed was because he favors the Strategic Defense Initiative,
   and MC is run by a bunch of communists. This will no doubt please

   Pournelle claims that he heard at a science fiction convention that
   you (chris) had said that the real reason his account was flushed was
   that ``he (pournelle) is a fascist.'' Given the current political
   climate, this could raise some sort of ruckus, so it would probably be
   good to nip this in the bud.

   All we have to to is warn Byte that MIT will sue the magazine if any
   incorrect defamatory comments are made by Pournelle. I am sure the
   editors there have the same opinion of him that we do and will make
   sure that Pournelle doesn't end them up in court.

   As it stands Pournelle really doesn't understand the state of the
   world. If he insists on printing his delusions then MIT's case would
   be trivial to win.

ROFL!

In an email exchange with Pournelle after I took him to task for whining
about the Amiga or UNIX or something in his User's Column in Byte (It's a
damn shame is Mad Friend Maclean died, he used to keep Jerry under control)
he told *ME* that he and Larry Niven had left the ARPANET voluntarily
because he was tired of all the flaming.

Maybe he even believes it these days.

We had a 2050 at Columbia in 1978 when I was a freshman. I understand
the year before it was a beta system. And a year or two later they got
a 2060. The two were networked together and DEC also tied them to NYU
and CMU. We used the net to send files between the two machines. Then
about 1983, I was visiting Cornell and asked a friend to show me how his id
looked like. I figured out how to send mail to him but when I got back
to Columbia and sent the message, I got back a really stern and nasty
sounding warning that I was using ARPANET illegally..

Thanks on behalf of all the old DECies who lurk (and sometimes contribute) 
here. As someone said when DEC announced that LCG was moving to Marlboro, 
"you can take the boy out of The Mill but you can't take The Mill out of the 
boy." DEC somehow managed to first take "The Mill" out of their corporate 
culture and then (I understand) took The Mill out of DEC entirely.

After a twenty-seven year involvement, first as an employee then as a 
customer, I was saddened by DEC's decline but then ceased being interested in 
DEC as a company some number of years ago. So now they're being acquired by 
Compaq...ho-hum.

As I read Dan's thoughtful posting I was reminded of a "project" I got 
involved in sometime around 1967 or 1968. There was an active auto racing 
sub-culture in the mill at that time. Many race car parts were being turned 
out in the machine and fabrication shop on the first floor of Building 5 
during off hours. Custom wiring harnesses were being designed and fabricated 
in various corners of the mill. The instrument panel in my race car had the 
same black splatter finish as DEC cabinet panels of the era. There was a lot 
of cross pollination of ideas among the drag, stock, and sports car racers 
who worked in The Mill.

At about that time the EPA had started to impose exhaust emmision regulations 
and Robert Bosch had just introduced the first production electronic fuel 
injection (EFI) systems. Some of us got to talking about where this would all 
lead and decided that EFI was the technology of the future. Fred Gould was an 
active drag racer and headed up the modules product line. We started looking 
at the possible numbers and decided that someone would have to make all those 
EFI control modules, so why not DEC? I presented a "back-of-the-envelope" 
summary of the idea to my boss and was given permission to spend one day a 
week looking into the EFI question. At this time I was a PDP-8 programmer.

Ron Boudreau (Formula Vee racer) somehow got ahold of a Bosch EFI module. I 
seem to remember disassembling it and going over the electronics with Fred 
and some of his engineers. We decided that by DEC module standards it was 
hopelessly primitive and we came up with an estimate of what it would cost to 
produce a more state of the art equivalent. Finally we decided to sanity test 
our ideas. 

GM's Hydromatic Division had been working with DEC on the design of the 
PDP-14, an industrial controller. Through contacts there Fred got to talk to 
some folks at GM's R&D facility. Turns out GM thought they could meet the EPA 
requirements for the forseeable future with carburators, air pumps, and 
catalytic converters. They acknowledged that EFI was in the future, but not 
for many years; and with the volumes involved they would probably manufacture 
their own controllers.

Based upon that input we dropped our "project", but it's an example of the 
kind of activities encouraged by the corporate culture that existed at DEC 
during its early years. Also, twenty-twenty hindsight proves GM was right on 
target.

Probably because I assisted other users.  Others kept their accounts
because they made themselves useful in various other ways, such as
helping to write and debug the software.

No.  I did briefly visit MIT in person in 2/86 (when I was in town for
Boskone), 2/87 (Boskone) 1/89 (IAP), 9/89 (Worldcon), and 1/90 (IAP).

(Boskone and the Worldcon are science fiction conventions.  Boskone
was held annually in Boston through 1987.  It's now held annually in
Framingham.  The Worldcon is in a different city every year.  It was
last in Boston in 1989, and won't return there before 2004 at the
earliest.  IAP is an annual event, open to everyone, held by MIT.)

Being seen in person, even if only for a minute, *does* make a
difference, if you want to call that "connections".

This is awful...
I'll make a long story short.  My parents bought a PC.  And T-shirt
transfer paper.  I got to make a test shirt.  Class pictures is today.
I'll be the one in the DECSYSTEM-10 shirt...

It has the yellow-on-green decsystem10 logo, and underneath it reads
"If it's not 36 bits, you're not playing a full DEC."
(I know there's supposed to be a with here^ but I couldn't fit it on the
 transfer page.)

I hope they don't make me change shirts...  But it doesn't have anything
that's bad on it, and it's not like there's a rule saying I can't wear a
shirt that plugs a 30 year old computer...

Cool.  I did that same thing (8085 cross assembler written as macro-10
macros, generating one 8 bit byte per 36 bit word.)  Very handy to have all
those macro features without exerting any effort!  I Wrote a forth in it
(well, typed it in from kilobaud magazine), and ran it on my 8085 simulator
(for tops10 - this was my final project for a microprocessor class at Penn.)
Couldn't tell which piece had the bugs in it :-)

The 8085 simulator went on the ARPANet somewhere, and later (82, 83?)
appeared as a full-blown commercial CPM simulator that would run Z80 cpm
binaries on your Decsystem-10 (or was it 20.)  I forget the name of the
company.  I was offered a discount on their package for the part my
simulator played in in the origin of their product.  Seemed fair enough;
they had gone a long way from where I stopped...

little over the years.  I still see some of them from time to time.

Adventure did get ported to the DC76.  Dave Bell, Mike Gilbert, Dave
Neff, Dan Duffel and I did it.  We also did the reverse vidio hack
"in" the '76.  It made the VT52 scroll down, home was in the lower

Copies I made from an archive of MC before it went down.

It pays to keep your archives in order - while the computer industry
may decide that everything is obsolete every 6 months, some of us have
decided to go for the long haul, and are carefully maintaining
card readers, paper tape punches, and 7-track tape drives :-).  I

there was a reason that BBE was picked on by Jim and Tony; but that 
was only once and BBE never did it again.  :-)

Well, mine came with the mounting extrusion, which was double sided
stickey taped to the top of the system.

You (bah) can have it if you want...

p.s. I remember the reason that BBE was despised for those few weeks.
Seems it had to do with a certain field test trip.

The funny part is that when we started the "reverse vidio" hack on
BBE, he called field circus because his terminal was "broken", and
they replaced the deflection yoke and the tube, trying to fix it.....

I didn't hear about that.  I guess I should tell our part of the
story.....Once upon a time....

For some reason, I opened up SOS.MAC.  It's possible that somebody
told me what BBE was doing.  He had removed ALL form feeds from the
source.  I went to him and asked him  1. why he did it (because that
was his style of editing) and 2. to put them back (never with the
attitude that I was a stupid broad--that was a mistake :-)).

I went to Jim and Tony fuming, swearing, and beating up the walls.
Tony asked me what was wrong and I told him that BBE had taken out
all the form feeds in SOS.  Jim, by the way, just sat back and
watched, grinning.  Tony told me that I was being unreasonable and
a stupid shit for getting upset about something nobody cared about.
I continued to argue with him that the form feeds should go back
into the MAC file and he lost patience with me (he did that often).
So, after we had fought for a little while about the value of SOS,
I got up and, while walking out of the office, said, "BBE edits 
the monitor sources, too."

The next morning Jim and Tony were giggling away.  They had spent 
their whole S/A time, developing and debugging an aspect that 
affected only BBE's PPN.  Upon logging in, his whole directory
would appear backwards.  Tony also provided a MIC file in his
directory (that read forwards) to put his stuff back to its
original status.  By the time everything was ready, there were
a few of the maintainers who had stopped by and were told about
the trick.  They went off to watch what BBE did when he logged
in that morning.  I don't remember any more of the details, but
apparently he never figured out what happened or how to put the
files back (somebody had to show him).  

Oh, he put back the form feeds.

Well, I guess I'll tell a small part of CDO's story.

Some time in '78 or '79, when a monitor (forget the version, but it
might have been 7.01 (SMP)) was going out, it was a real big deal.
There were teams going to each field test site, and they had people
from development, support, and field service going to each customer.
Well, Tony, I think it was CDO (might have been Jim), BBE and others
went to one location, and a few of us got to read the trip report that
BBE put in.

Looked like CDO (or was it Jim) and Tony were there just to fetch
coffee every now and then, and contribute a few little things during
the trip.  Just a little bit of help to the customer... 

Management, of course, believed the report.  

(It was Elton.  Remember Elton?  He once said "I can scew up all I
want, because DEC won't fire me because I am black!"  His exact words.
And he did screw up, and did as little as possible.  He's the one that
Pope Richard (Cower) once stood up on his desk and screamed at. Maybe
100 people heard it. "Elton, you are a f******g a*****e."  Thats
another long story, lets not go there.)  

A few people were really upset, and that started the "Open season war"
on BBE.

The hacks included:

	FLIP.MIC  (Better known as PILF.CIM)

	Reverse Vidio

	DAEMON (would check for BBE, and log him out silently 
		some time between 30 and 90 minutes after he logged in.)
		There were other hacks there, but I forget what CDO did.

	His terminal kept getting "fixed".

Since this wasn't directly related to the monitor names discussion I broke it
out just for fun.  One of the last things I saw mentioned was wild things done
to one another in the systems group.  Well..  I was only a Dec customer but we
(the systems people) used to pull a few interesting things on each other.  Two
things that vividly come to mind are:

One afternoon we were particularly bored.  One of the main systems guys wrote a
small program that sent the string "DECSYSTEM-20 NOT RUNNING" to the head
system programer's terminal.  It also followed this up with a keyboard lock
sequence that Z19's responded to.  The system AMPEX mem box timing had been
goofy for the past few weeks so right after we ran this John D. burst out of
his office and ran over to the two Dec 20 consoles and proceeded to scratch his
head for a few minutes.  You should have heard the words emitted when he heard
us all laughing in the background.

Another time we got into John D's gexec init file and added in a "WATCH BEARS"
command.  For those who didn't get goodies tapes from the other universities
running TOPS 20, gexec was a small program which had some nice functions for
systems people.  The watch command could be set to watch for various system
events.  In this case we told it to watch for a user called BEARS (who didn't
exist)  One of John D.'s favorite sayings was "Do bear's s**t in the woods" 
The next time he logged in he was greeted with the message "No BEARS yet"

John went on to work at DEC's support center in CO in the TOPS20 group.  I
think his time with us seasoned him to the weird things that customers would
tell him when their system crashed -- <smirk>

Well, I certainly wouldn't write about "TOPS Monitor calls" or
filesystems as if they were all the same.  But much of the GALAXY code
was common.  DN87S was *too* common.  (The first release for TOPS-10
used byte pointers that could only be interpreted by the TOPS-20
microcode.  It would start just fine but crash reliably when the first
job started.  Finding this was an interesting job!  Fortunately we had
two 2060 systems, one running each OS, at the time, so I was familiar
with the differences.)

This doesn't have much to do with PDP-10s, but...:

PixieFuel claims to be from Middlesex, NJ and gave a rather mild
description of the place.

As PixieFuel says, Middlesex is one of those benightened hamlets where
homosexuality is defined as being "intelligent and interested in
computers."  Needless to say, most of the "queers" who are beaten up are
not gay; but many of the jocks who beat up "queers" are. 

Middlesex girls get pregnant starting about seventh grade.  The high point
of the year for Middlesex boys is the extended Halloween season, the merry
days of vandalism.  The inevitable fate of a Middlesex youngster who does
not escape is to become like Al and Peg Bundy in "Married with Children". 

I lived in Middlesex, NJ from 1967 until 1973; my junior high school and
high school years.  One of the reasons why I dropped out of high school
after 3 years (to go to college -- I'm a high school dropout with a
bachelor of science degree...) was to get out of Middlesex High School.

At least I went to a college with a PDP-10; otherwise I never would have
been debrainwashed from two years of OS/360!!!  Thus began an abiding
relationship which continues to this day, 25 years later.  A whole room of
my house is consumed by two DEC-2020 mainframes, dual ported to two RM05s
and two RM03s.

Fortunately for me, my significant other is a tolerant sort who accepts
that she has to share her man with a machine, although she has at times
questioned which comes first...  Well, let's face it; women come and women
go, but a PDP-10 is forever!  ;-) ;-) 

Anyway, if PixieFuel is really from Middlesex and has run afoul of the
Middlesex culture, she deserves our deepest sympathy.  If she's reading
this, she can take this consolation from an old fart who escaped long ago: 
there is life after Middlesex.

Also, take this advice: get a life outside of the network.  Go to the
range with an AK-47 and perforate Barney targets with hundreds of holes. 
Go to the furthest and most desolate place imaginable, and get thoroughly
cold, wet, tired, and miserable (in other words, truly happy).  Eat
poisonous puffer fish at a restaurant in Tokyo.  Drive a Formula Ford at
Laguna Seca.  Learn a foreign language that no sensible person would think
of studying.  Pan for gold in a frigid stream in Alaska.  Collect stuff.

It'll help you get perspective.  As you get to the age of the people who
actually know what a PDP-10 is, you'll get another one: everytime is
someone's golden age.  You weren't even born during my "golden age of the
network."

PS: Thanks for the nice words about Pine.  I'll tell the other Pine
developers.

My favourite was RSTS/E. It indeed had multiple personalities, in that
it had emulation for the two other popular operating systems
RT11 and RSX. For a very long time the only native development tool
was basic, fortran and macro-11 was running under RT11 emulation.

I think RSTS was originally developed on a DEC-10.
I once had my hands on a RSTS version 2(?) source listing, and it was
full of witty comments, and I think it was assembled with MACY11.
In any case, the devices where called DSK:, TTY: LPT: etc.
Rumours said it was originally made as a holiday/semester project or
something by one or two programmers.

The RSTS run time systems was in my opinion DEC-10 hi-segs in
disguise. That is, a program had two segments, the low segment,
and the high segment. You executed the low segment, and the
high segment followed with it. What was not DEC-10'ish was that
the keyboard command interpreter was an ordinary user program.
That is, RSTS had no actual native keyboard command interpreter.
(Except for the very early versions)

When a concept is new it often has several names.  Usually it
settles to one eventually (unless IBM persists in using
another :-)

Grace Hopper used the name Exec as in executive.  She thought
it was appropriate since the Exec makes command decisions
typical of top executives, schedules resources, etc.  So at
Remington Rand the monitors/operating systems/timesharing
systems were called Execs such as 1108's Exec-8.

Soon after invented in 1886 at Coney Island a new ride type
was called:

    Giant Dipper
    Big Dipper
    Scenic Railway
    Scenic Railroad
    Rollercoaster

Today we call them all rollercoasters.  By the bye
rollercoasters are called:

    Spanish    "Russian Hills"
    French     "Russian Hills"
    Italian    "Russian Hills"
    Portuguese "Russian Hills"
    Russian    "American Hills" (True, no joke)
    German     "Figure-8 Railroads"
    English    "Rollercoasters"

By the bye Rollercoasters were actually invented in 1735 in
St. Petersburg Russia and reinvented 151 years later at Coney
Island with no knowledge of the previous work.  The inventors
were NOT named respectively Babbage and Eckert & Mauchley :-)

I worked for Alliant Computer for 7+ years.  The machines we
made were called:

    VAX Killers
    Affordable Supercomputers
    Minisupercomputers
    Air Cooled Supercomputers
    Personal Supercomputers

	A lot of it was DECNET with DEC20s.  When Columbia got a
second DEC20 ca 1980, we had to use network software to move files
(they added a VM/CMS IBM 4341 a year later), so we got to "see" some
stuff at CMU and NYU (mostly "finger" of who was logged on). Mail was
by MM, which also ran BBoard - I believe a version of MM is still
available on ftp://kermit.columbia.edu. I once went to visit a friend
at Cornell in 1982 and when I sent an e-mail to him, I got a nasty
message back that I wasn't authorised to use ARPANET. The stuff was
written NODE::DISK:<log.on.id>filename.ext.  In the SPring of 1981 I
crossed wires 2&3 and tried to plug the Chemical Engineering Plessey
11 to the DEC20 and it came crashing down repeatedly because they were
both full-duplexing the first character ad infinitum - so a buch of my
classmates wrote something now known as Kermit.  I believe BITNET
(with IBM VM) was the next step when Columbia and CCNY linked up, but
I wasn't on campus then (but I still got the newsletter by snail
mail). Then about 1989, Senator Al Gore promoted NSFNET. I sent an
e-mail to CompuServe customer service (I'm sure I wasn't the only one
making that suggestion) asking why we don't get e-mail linkage via
some local university and we got in via
saqqara.cis.ohio-state.edu. Initially it was cluncky for others to
include all that routing info in my e-mail address.  After Delphi sent
out postcards to sign on, a lot of users began clamoring for newgroups
accesson CompuServe. In 1994, I was visiting my Columbia
Bioengineering mentor who had retired to la Jolla when one of his
staffers showed me this "neat new thing" called Mosaic and the
"Web". Although I had used a bunch of gopher servers on Delphi and
some library dial up catalogs, wider access to the Web started with
Lynx on Unix systems.  I'd bet if you could get your hands on the
computer newsletters of one of the more prestigious universities
(Columbia, CMU, Stanford) for the past twenty-five years, you'ld get
an accurate picture.

I forged one of those!  I saw this line somewhere, and my parents had just
bought a bunch of T-shirt transfers, so I made a quickie clone.  I scanned
the "DECsystem-10" logo from the front of my TOPS-10 manual, added the
line above it (Except I wrote "If it's not 36 bits, you're not playing a
full DEC" instead because of space constraints.  The T-shirt may be big,
but the xfer is only 8.5"x11"...) and wore it to school pictures.
I even had my "Introducing the expandable PDP-10!" card, but the teachers
made me leave it upstairs.  Then they "lost" the picture...

If anyone has a picture of the original I may be able to reproduce it...
I didn't know the line was on a shirt.  I just thought it would be funny
to wear it.  This other guy in class had 3 shirts:  An Ameritech T, an
Intel Bunny-Geek T, and a Microsoft 95 logo tee.  Lord, did I have fun
making him mad...  (Like bringing a MicroVAX in one day, and proving I
could boot VAX/VMS before 95 came up...  And the same with RSTS/E and my
11/44...  Lord, was he ever mad!  He was one of those types that will
decapitiate you if you proved him wrong, but I didn't care...)

    We had a bizarre problem with a DEC-20 back in about 1980.
There were frequent crashes with inconsistent error messages. Field
Circus swapped all the boards, but nothing solved the problem. DEC
flew in a person whose expertise was looking at wire wrap backplanes,
searching for loose bits of wire, broken wires, nicked insulation, and so
on.
Still no luck and the problem continued for several weeks. One poor FS
technician decided to clean the contacts on all the CPU cards, so he got
an eraser and pulled out all the cards. He happened to glance at the
backplane and there was white paint on it! The paint hadn't been able to
bind to the plastic and was flaking off, falling on the cards and causing
all
sorts of inconsistent faults. He scraped off the paint, vacuumed thoroughly
and put the system back together. It worked. Shortly afterward, DEC gave
us a new backplane with system upgrade from a 2040 to a 2050.

Remarkably good.  14" disk packs and 8" floppies from the same
era usually read without any difficulty, too, though I wouldn't
want to use any of this older media more than is absolutely
necessary - oxide tends to start flaking off the disks after
20-25 years.

What can be a problem are 7-track and 9-track 1/2" tape.  Many
brands of tape, from the 60's through the 90's, become gummy
if not stored under absolutely pristine environmental conditions.
This gumminess isn't a problem if the tape is read from beginning
to end without any start/stop cycles or retries, so recovery
efforts concentrate very much on smooth, continuous tape motion
and signal processing techniques that maximize the data recovered
on the first try.

The only brand of tape where I never have the gumminess problem
is 3M 700/Blackwatch.  It seems that Imation continues to
manufacture this stuff, and that is a Good Thing.

I second that.  I've had no trouble reading data off DECtapes from the early

Well, there is that :-).  I remember field service types
telling stories about DECtape readability with great awe
in their voices.  The treatment of these tapes included
throwing the tapes in the back of their station wagon
and forgetting about them until needed again.  Of course,
these tapes went through winter and summer seasons, getting
heated and frozen on a regular basis.  There were also
stories about animals, tape crunching [literally, not
figuratively], etc.  

I was just curious about the time element since we couldn't
test that back then :-).

Thanks for the info.

All this Date 75 stuff remineded me of an SPR support once got:

	Bug:	You sold system 28 to us.

[I think it was 28]

	Fix:	Please remove system 28 from the magic table in SYSTAT

Seems systat had two tables, one of all the developers birthdays, and
one of the systems owned by DEC.  When SYSTAT was built, those were
included in the shipped version.  So, when we sold the old KA to a
customer (after refurb), they started seeing the developers birthdays,
just like the folks in house.

It was an easy fix.

As I've said before, anyone who wants a brown-painted KS10 just has to show
up in Troy NY (Thruway exit 23) with a minivan or trailer, I've got lots of
them (not guaranteed to work, but I've got plenty of spare boards too) and
I'd love to get most of them out of here.

Also a much-resented revenue source for the computer center.  They bought
DECtapes in bulk but sold them at full retail.  Since disk quotas were
limited to 100 blocks (200 for "sponsored" accounts), purchase of DECtapes
was pretty much mandatory to do any useful work.  100 blocks is a
whopping 57.6K.

Needless to say, computer center employees got disk quotas in the
thousands of blocks.  They also sold computer time to outsiders, who
similarly never seemed to have disk quota problems.

Oh yeah, mere students and sponsored accounts were subject to "loser", a
charming little program which deleted any files which hadn't been
referenced in the past 7 days.  Once again, computer center employees and
outsiders didn't have this problem.

I'll admit that their total disk capacity was only 36MB when I first
started there, but the fundamental unfairness of these policies triggered
lasting impressions.  Among other things, there were those of us who
cheered the demise of DECtapes because that meant that computer centers
actually had to think about long-term online storage for mere users.

Yup.  I had a little program called KNLAFM (Keep Nasty Loser Away From Me)
which did exactly that (of course, it was written in assembly).  Needless
to say, the computer center promptly put KNLAFM on their "banned programs"
list, along with such dangerous programs as ADVENT.

It was Against The Rules to possess a banned program; they would even scan
your private DECtapes and magtapes for such.  They'd also scan for any
neat files that you might have and make copies for themselves; there was
no such thing as a privacy policy at that place.

If you ever hear ex-Stevens Tech people from that era talk about VADing,
VAD was one of the names under which ADVENT was hidden, and "to vad" meant
to engage in any sort of similar activity in real life (e.g. steam
tunneling).  This was slightly after my time, but I know most of the folks
who were involved.

Oh, I forgot to mention, after my time, the regular disk quota at that
place got cut from 100 blocks to 50 blocks.  A whopping 28,800 bytes.
From what I heard, that was the last straw and it was open warfare.
Although I would have loved to see it, I probably would've been blamed for
it so it was better that I wasn't around...

One good thing that came out of it is that a lot of us folks who suffered
under these policies went elsewhere determined to have the exact
*opposite* policies on the systems we managed.  Our users would pissed off
at us for one thing or another (often with good reason), but they never
*hated* us and we never had significant internal subversion problems.  I
wonder why... ;-)

The quota he speaks of was the standard student account that was offered
under the auspices of the Stevens student chapter of the ACM.  They were
also open for use after 5:00 P.M. and on weekends.  Originally the ACM was
the orgainization that sponsored the use of the machine on Sundays, but
things got more popular after my freshman year.

I remember that other programs such as AID (a version of JOSS) and I think
Focal got banned on the grounds that they had "immediate mode" and that "the
computer is not to be used as a desk calculator".  Then Dec introduced a
version of Basic that had immediate mode, and they could not tell from a
SYSTAT that you were doing that, so I think they threw up their hands.  Too
labor intensive I guess.

In steam tunneling, or in renaming ADVENT?

Yeah, that would have been fun to watch...
I see somewhat the same thing today, but it's not fun at all.  In your
case, the students would have had to come up with ingenious or creative
ways to circumvent system security to Stick It To Da Man.  Nowadays, the
students at the high school I work at don't like our policy (We won't let
them on porno sites, we won't let them print obscene pictures, etc.) and
so they do stupid things to destroy the hardware, which (Thanks to the
PeeCee having taken over) is right there in front of them.  Little or no
brains involved, and a pain in the ass.  Usual treatment of the machines
is breaking Win95 security (Ha!) and formatting C, or jamming metal
objects in the floppy drives, and stealing the mouseballs.  The teachers
don't get held liable for this, so they just don't give a rat's a$$ and
let the animals do this.  It's sickening.

That's not nearly as wierd as the SAIL system, which for a long time was
a three processor system: KL10, KA10, and PDP-6!  Only the KL ran ordinary
user programs, but the KA and the -6 did run real-time user programs, as
well as the XGP (granddaddy of the laser printer, which was, ironically
enough, a recycled fax machine), the first full-scale real-time digital
synthesizer, and various other obscure peripherals.

Simple!  It's the failure to give the computer its own personal 24-hour staff
(of tape lackeys, printout sorters, etc.).  :-)  :-)  :-)

Re MRC's comments about IBM, let's not get carried away now!  You are of course
correct that the PDP-11 represented a significant break with DEC tradition and
if you're a true believer in that tradition, this is an unforgivable crime.
But a mini-IBM 360 it certainly was NOT.  The only un-octal thing about the
PDP-11 is the byte and word size, the instruction operand subfields fall
clearly on 3-bit boundaries, which by the way is not entirely true of the
PDP-10 (the left halfword is a bit messy).

As for bit/byte order, that's a strange topic to bring up.  The PDP-10
documentation claims to number the bits from left to right (hmm, like the
earlier mainframes from what other company?), but the shift/rotate instructions
shift LEFT with positive numbers (maybe I'm the only one who thinks the shift
count should represent the change in bit number).  The byte manipulation is
inconsistant -- all the instructions that manipulate byte pointers consider
the positive direction to be moving from left to right within the word,
but the byte pointers themselves record the byte's starting position as the
number of bits from the *right*.

Re skips vs. branches, OK skips allow handling simple conditional execution
w/o requiring a prefetch queue flush, but -- there was no prefetch queue!
They also open the door to all kinds of nifty tricks which are lost with
branches.  But the PDP-11 was supposed to be a low-end workhorse anyway (but
still a step up from the PDP-8), and multi-word instructions are a good way
to enlarge the address space w/o enlarging the word size.  I hope you'll
agree that once you've switched to variable instruction lengths, branches
are a cleaner way to handle conditions than having three different sizes of
skips (or one wasteful skip that has to read and decode the skipped opcode
to find out how far to skip, yech).

Anyway comparing this to big ugly machines with opcode fields on 4-bit
multiples, lopsided 24(31?)/12 base/displacement addressing with wacky
*unsigned* displacements, non-interruptable string instructions, no stack
instructions, a brain-damaged floating point format, inconsistant alignment
requirements, and a character set (blessed by hardware support) that looks
like some kind of sick joke, is an unfair insult to the PDP-11 architecture.

It was designed to complement, rather than destroy, the PDP-10;  the fact
that DEC decided to extend the *wrong* architecture for deranged political
reasons (I mean, what other company so consistantly gives up profits just
to maintain their own image of what kind of business they think they should
be in?  Killing the 10 AND the 11/74 AND the 11/70 all basically to keep
the VAX from looking bad, then refusing to support 4BSD sites, ignoring the
Arpanet after having been involved in the early days, telling Dan Bricklin
to fuck off, assuming the Alpha will sell itself, it just never ends!) isn't
the PDP-11's fault, and the bad blood between groups is something that really
ought to be put in perspective now that the VAX has killed off the *entire*
PDP series and then committed suicide.

The KL and its canceled follow on rebirth as XKL by XKL LLC had 22bit physical
address
and 23bit virtual address  which makes it a 4Mword machines ie about 16Mbytes
physical memory
and 8Mwords per user of virtual address ie about 36Mbytes which was all before
1983 which back then made it a massive machine. Granted it took some time
before people got non macro programs to expand out of section 0 but they did.
even TOPS-10 in its
final version got with the program of virtual memory and more than one section
( At least I think it did).

The KL read 4 word into cache every time one was required and did a fare amount
of interleaving of memory controllers I think
DEC had it as best it could be shame amount the power supply :) Also It would
have the next word being pre fetched by the
MBOX while the EBOX executed the current one. There is a fare amount of
technology happening in a KL10 they still look
interesting to me in 1998 and I expect even 2003.

The instruction set on PDP-10 was in my  opinion ideal RISC technology even DEC
thought so for Jupiter I believe others got
it right. The difficulty I believe is the n degree of indirection allowed by
the processor if this had been fix at one or even just a known low  number,
then I think that this processor could have been made to really sing with quite
deep pipes and multiple
issue. As it is the processor is so difficult to pipeline. It has such an
advantage over VAX which had one of the most variable
length instructions and just plain stack crazy  (don't get me wrong and I think
CALLG CALLS to be my best friends as well
as my processors worst enemies) To have instructions in one word with set
predefined bits  makes and execution unit so much
simpler, does any one know how difficult it was for Jud Leonard to transition
from PDP-10 microcode to VAX-11 microcode development ?
    As I have said before the 10's died an un-natural death at the hands of
their parents , its hard to know where they might have
been maybe the same, its a very strange world we live in , I'm oft thinking of
becoming a Zoo keeper :)

I am sure that this has happened at a lot of sites, at least it
did at my former place of work.

I think the grand total was six totalled RP06 diskpacks, three badly
maimed RP06 drives, and one seriously embarrased chief operator.

As is usually the case with such stories, I wasn't actually there to
watch it happen, it was claimed to have happened some time before I
got my job there. The operator was still there, though, and was
regularly reminded of his foulup.

	Not exactly equivalent, but I'm in a "cracker-barrel tale"
mood, and this reminded me of an event I _was_ there to witness.
This other guy (No, really) was debugging some instructions he
had added to uur Univac 7900 (Yes, truly, and another cool story,
we called it "hands-in programming" :-) when he just wasn't
getting any "wigggle" on the expected signals. Checked the settings
on the scope, look OK. Hung the scope-probe on a few other lines
to check it out, Hmm, no wiggle. Started touching the scope-probe
to random test-points across the two-by-four meter backplane,
no wiggle (although the lights on the console were a-blinkin
away. Touched the scope-probe to the "main clock", which was
actually somewhat of the "main power-supply" on this diode-core
logic machine, about 3KW IIRC) and was rewarded by a sharp
CRACK! from the probe housing. Seems the probe-tip had been
internally shorted to the ground-ring. Seems that he'd been
shorting-out and _blowing_ the drivers of all those random
signals he had hung it on. Took him a week to find and replace
all the blown cards :-) (Well, at the time, :-( )

	And then there was the time one guy told the CE that
he'd used the alignment pack for scratch, when he ran out.
"Ya know, two of the tracks had a lot of erros, so I had
to re-format it". For the ones who aren't old enough to find
this funny, the "alignment pack" had two tracks deliberately
offset radially from the "correct" position, one inward, one
outward. The head-carriage was aligned by making sure the
signals from both were roughly equal. Alignment packs were
specially made at some IBM facility and had a _grey_ upper
platter to visually distinguish them from normal packs.

I was there to watch it happen.

I was a young systems programmer at the Stanford AI Lab towards the end of
its existance (late 1970s).  Two of our disk drives were for UDPs (User
Disk Packs); in other words, private, removable disk packs as
distinguished from the system packs.

I was working in the machine room when I noticed that the CTY (the
console) was spewing a lot of disk channel errors from one of the UDPs.
Prominent in the message was the word "DEATH" (it turned out that this was
one of the status bits from the Foonly channel).  There was also this very
loud buzz-saw noise coming from that drive.

I was the most junior system programmer there, and pretty much not allowed
to mess with things.  I chafed at the restrictions, and often circumvented
them, but this was different.  I called up the hardware engineer:
 "I think that there may be a head crash on one of the UDPs."
 "Why do you say that?"
 "Well, the CTY keeps on giving disk error messages with this word DEATH
  in it, and there's this loud buzz-saw noise coming from the drive."
 "SHUT THE DRIVE DOWN!!!  NOW!!  DON'T TOUCH!" <phone hangs up>

I figured that the correct interpretation of those screamed instructions
was "spin down the drive but otherwise leave it alone."  Which I did.  
The hardware engineer presently came dashing in (I prudently staying out
of the way) and autopsied.  It was, indeed, a head crash.  He later
apologized for screaming at me; he didn't know that all that I knew about
"head crash" was the term.

The next day, I noticed the CTY against spewing out the same error
message, this time on the other UDP.  There was no buzzing noise coming
from it.  I spun it down (figuring that's what I was supposed to do) and
called the hardware engineer:
 "The other UDP is giving the same DEATH messages, so I shut it down."
 "I'll be right over."

Sure enough, it had just started to head crash.  All the user packs were
immediately impounded; something like 10 of them had some amount of
damage.

The crash had started with a different pack than the one was in the first
UDP when I discovered it.  After the first UDP drive was taken down, that
pack (which was not yet known to have been crashed) was put on the other
UDP and damaged its heads.  Then other packs had been mounted on that UDP.

Had all packs been impounded immediately after the first head crash, it's
believed that at least some of the packs which were lost in that incident
would not have been crashed.  Fortunately, none of that was my fault, and
if anything, I had prevented an ever worse disaster.  But the hardware
engineer and lead system programmer were kicking themselves...

I've since experienced other head crashes, most recently of my 2020's main
RM05 pack last November.  All have been of the quiet variety; no buzz-saw
noises.  However, I still get this twinge when I hear drives with noisy
bearings.

I pulled a good one thinking noise = headcrash...
My desk is a mess.  It's arranged like this:

+-------------+  
|DECSERVER 200|  
+-------------+  +--------+ +---------+
|MicroVAX 3100|  |  VAX   | | PEECEE  |
+-------------+  | CONSOLE| | MONITOR |
| DEMPR       |  |        | |         |
+-------------+  +--------+ +---------+

And assorted garbage (Like the Sailor Mercury doll on top the VAX console)
is scattered around it.  Anyway, if case you forgot your DEC model names,
a DEMPR is basically a hub for 10Base2.
Anyway, this starts about the beginning of last month.  I start hearing an
odd noise from the VAX, sounds like bearing noises.  So, I do
DIR DKAXXX:[000000...]*.*;* on all the drives, and say SHO DEV DK.  It
reports no errors.  So I ignore the noise, having no way of backing this
machine up.  Over the next few days, the noise gets progressivley louder,
until I can actually hear the device SPIN DOWN periodically.  So I repeat
the above exercise.  No errors.  I'm thinking "Goddess!  How is it running
while making that horrible noise?"  So, I down the VAX.  (and blew a
55-day uptime too :( ) Turn the power off.  All is silent.  Then I hear
the "drive" spinning up again...

You probably guessed it.  I'd forgotten about the DEMPR fan.  The bearings
in it had gone, and since it was right under the VAX, I couldn't tell the
difference.  It's since been replaced.
