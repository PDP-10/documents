Yep, I misremembered.

I found a web page that describes why that particular date was chosen.
http://www.magnet.ch/serendipity/hermetic/cal_stud/jdn.htm describes how
astronomers decided that 17-Nov-1858 is day 0 for the Modified Julian Day
Number.

(They subtracted 2,400,000 from the full Julian Day Number, allowing dates
up to the year 2130 can be specified as a 5 digit number, instead of 7 digits.)

   Julian Day Numbers by Peter Meyer
     
  HISTORY
  
     The Julian Day number system was invented by Joseph Justus Scaliger
     (born 1540-08-05 J in Agen, France, died 1609-01-21 J in Leiden,
     Holland), who during his life immersed himself in Greek, Latin,
     Persian and Jewish literature. His invention (in 1583) of the Julian
     day number system is considered by some the foundation of the
     science of chronology.
     
     Although the term Julian Calendar derives from the name of Julius
     Caesar, the term Julian day number probably does not. Most say that
     this system was named, not after Julius Caesar, but after its
     inventor's father, Julius Caesar Scaliger (1484-1558). Perhaps it
     was simply named after the Julian Calendar.
     
     The younger Scaliger combined three traditionally recognized
     temporal cycles of 28, 19 and 15 years to obtain a great cycle, the
     Scaliger cycle, or Julian period, of 7980 years (7980 is the
     least common multiple of 28, 19 and 15). According to the
     Encyclopedia Brittanica:
     
     The length of 7,980 years was chosen as the product of 28 times 19
     times 15; these, respectively, are the numbers of years in the
     so-called solar cycle of the Julian calendar in which dates recur on
     the same days of the week; the lunar or Metonic cycle, after which
     the phases of the Moon recur on a particular day in the solar year,
     or year of the seasons; and the cycle of indiction, originally a
     schedule of periodic taxes or government requisitions in ancient
     Rome.
     
     The first Scaliger cycle began with Year 1 on -4712-01-01 (Julian)
     and will end after 7980 years on 3267-12-31 (Julian), which is
     3268-01-22 (Gregorian). 3268-01-01 J is the first day of Year 1 of
     the next Scaliger cycle.

  ASTRONOMICAL SYTEM
  
     Little mention seems to be made as to whether Joseph Scaliger
     regarded -4712-01-01 J as day 0 or as day 1 in the first Julian
     period. Astronomers adopted this system and adapted it to their own
     purposes, and they took noon GMT -4712-01-01 as their zero point.
     For astronomers a day begins at noon and runs until the next noon
     (so that the nighttime falls conveniently within one "day"). Thus
     they defined the Julian day number of a day as the number of days
     (or part of a day) elapsed since noon GMT (or more exactly, UTC) on
     January 1st, 4713 B.C., in the Proleptic Julian Calendar. Thus the
     Julian day number of noon GMT on -4712-01-01 (Julian), or more
     casually, the Julian day number of -4712-01-01 itself, is 0. (Note
     that 4713 B.C. is the year -4712 according to the astronomical year
     numbering.) The Julian day number of 1996-03-31 is 2,450,174 --
     meaning that on 1996-03-31 2,450,174 days had elapsed since
     -4712-01-01 (or more exactly, that at noon on 1996-03-31 2,450,174
     days had elapsed since noon on -4712-01-01).
     
     Scaliger preceded the astronomers in introducing the notion of
     decimal times, designating midnight as .00, 6 a.m. as .25, midday as
     .50 and 6 p.m. as .75, thus allowing easier calculation involving
     dates and times. Astronomers, as noted above, preferred to use .00
     to mean midday and .50 to mean midnight.

  MODIFIED JULIAN DAY NUMBER
  
     This was not to the liking of all scholars using the Julian day
     number system, in particular, historians. For chronologists who
     start "days" at midnight, the zero point for the Julian day number
     system is 00:00 at the start of -4712-01-01 J, and this is day 0.
     This means that 2000-01-01 G is 2,451,545 JD.
     
     Since most days within about 150 years of the present have Julian
     day numbers beginning with "24", Julian day numbers within this
     300-odd-year period can be abbreviated. In 1975 the convention of
     the modified Julian day number was adopted:
     
     Given a Julian day number JD, the modified Julian day number MJD is
     defined as MJD = JD - 2,400,000.5. This has two purposes:
     
    1. Days begin at midnight rather than noon.
    2. For dates in the period from 1859 to about 2130 only five digits
       need to be used to specify the date rather than seven.
       
     
     
     MJD 0 thus corresponds to JD 2,400,000.5, which is twelve hours
     after noon on JD 2,400,000 = 1858-11-16. Thus MJD 0 designates the
     midnight of November 16th/17th, 1858, so day 0 in the system of
     modified Julian day numbers is the day 1858-11-17.
