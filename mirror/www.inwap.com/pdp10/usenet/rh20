We used to go over to F.A & T. to help with problems and from time to
time they would build a "special system" for us out of 2 or 3 customer
systems that were about to ship.  

One such request was a 2 CPU system that had huge amounts of disks.
(So we could actually test the stuff for supporting lots of disks.) 

 IIRC, it had 2 RH10s, and 4 RH20's per CPU, all the disks were dual
ported in various (e.g. all possible) configurations, and each string
had 8 disks. (all RP06's)  A total of 40 drives.

We went off and built a monitor for the sucker, and it worked!!!
Well, I remember we did find one bug, but it was an easy fix.

I think RDH and Gilbert actually did the testing.

Also, I think that 1026 had 2 RH10's on it as well.  One was for all
the RS04's (Three cabs worth of swap space), and the other ran some of
the system and user disks.
