Note that ZORK.EXE by itself is *not* Zork.  It's a small program that GET%'s
MDL104.EXE, GTJFN%'s MADADV.SAV, and starts MDL.  So you have to have those
three files, along with AGC104.EXE (the MDL garbage collector), all in a
directory defined as MDL:, for it to work.

The more I look at this code the more familiar it looks. Do you know
who wrote this? It looks very similar to code I wrote early 80s to
front-end  ZORK at the then Dundee Tech and probably posted to the
tops-20 mail list.. Anyone know if the archives of this list are
available online anywhere?

Also around 1982 I recalling hacking TOPS-10 Essex University Mud (Roy
Trubshaw, Richard Bartle) to run under TOPS-20 by using a pmap'd high
segment to emulate a TOPS-10 shared writeable high segment. A few
other fixes to bypass the lack of PAGE UUO in PA1050 were needed as
well. The source code for the MUD interpreter was writen in BCPL and
confusingly the Dungeon language was also called Muddle but was not
the same as Zork's MDL. If anyone has the source code for this classic
mult-user dungeon I'd like to hear. I know a number of sites had it at
one time.

Hellfire!  Why did Richard not mention this to me when I was going
through the same contortions at Liverpool Poly a few years later!?
I wound up creating a bespoke version of PA1050 for it, as well as
a PMAP etc bootstrap similar to that ZORK one.

I suspect there might be legal difficulties with making it available ...
I think I have it in a SUBFIL master snarfed from TOPS-20, in a VMS
BACKUP saveset on a TK50 -- with no facilities for reading it back,
AFAIA.  You'll probably be interested in <http://www.mud.co.uk/> anyway.

Ronan,

It's a long time ago but if you recall we were in touch way back then.
I remember Richard suggesting I talk to you. I recall you managed to
rapidly enter wizard mode when playing it on the DCT DEC20 by dialup
and I never did find the backdoor in the source code that allowed
this. IIRC it appended the name of the current player to the variable
"us" but exactly the sequence of commands I never did decode.

If you recall I also had some mods to PA1050 but as several sites
grabbed the code I didn't want them to have to run a patched PA1050.
Later the distribution was limited after contracts were signed for
commercial use and I received a letter insisting we stop running it.
Fortunately I was able to did out an old email from Richard giving
permission for us to run it and that stood.

At one point a change to TOPS-20 altered the way process mapped pages
were unmapped in routine KSELF (I think) by setting the abort
(cz%abt?) bit. This had the result that any pages not explicitly
flushed to disk were replaced with the virgin version so it was
necessary to patch MONITR.EXE as well. I never agreed with the logic
of this change as it broke a number of other applications but Mark
Crispin (IIRC) pointed out at the time why it was a good idea. I still
think an extra bit should have been defined somewhere to allow both
the old and the new behaviour.

Hmm, so which order were we working in?  I would have been involved
in porting MUD mostly in '85, and I don't remember getting or sending
modifications.

That sounds more like something Richard would have done ...
Reminds me of someone (yourself?) dialing in from another site, who
managed to bypass the limited command-table we had in EXEC for student
use by using DDT and his knowledge of the EXEC source.

I think I was trying to avoid 20-fying the MUD BCPL source too much,
although the MACRO came in for a fair amount of addition.

I can remember adding a new UUO (CALLI -2?) to PA1050 to set the
RDTXT/TEXTI prompt-buffer so forced ^Rs would work properly, and
adding OF%THW when the persona-file was opened, for shared read/write.
Another interesting thing was that PA1050's implementation of the
MSTIME UUO was not monotonically increasing across jobs.  As MUD
used this when interlocking, one job could find that another had
apparently taken out a lock in the (local) future.

The order I recall was Richard saying that you (as one of the original
coders) were now working at Liverpool Poly having transitioned to
TOPS-20 and your initial prognosis for getting MUD running on TOPS-20
had not been good. As I had already hacked DECWAR (I think it was) to
emulate a shared write high segment I suggested this method and spoke
to you at some point. I know I had to work with two distinct versions.
The first was just plain MUD but the second also had Fraggle Rock (was
it) and something else I can no longer recall.

The whole story was featured in a 198x edition of Practical Computing
which I may still have kicking about.

Maybe it was Richard (who did often call in over our then extremely
limited JANET connections which piggy backed in through Dundee
University) but I thought that was you. I think some interesting
floating point arithmetic was done to an ascii string involving some
input from the user probably dependent on the time of day. The magical
end result was that the user name of the current player was added to
the string "us" listing permanent wizards. At least one name for you
was already hard-coded into that string in the original Essex sources.
At least I think that was how it was done.

Aha! I never found the cause of that locking problem and implemented
some more locking around the "lock" routine to get round it.

Do you know Steve Reece? I mentioned Essex Mud to Steve at the recent
VMS technical update days in London and he mentioned your name which
was the first time I had heard it in years, I think he was probably a
student back then.

I only worked with MUD and VALLEY, but there were also ROCK, MIST,
and UNI -- these appeared after I left Essex IIRC, and were separate
games written by others using the MUD engine.  There may have been
more.

I didn't bother trying to fix PA1050 for that, just changed the game
sources to use the TIME JSYS instead.  Another PA1050 mod was to use
THIBR instead of DISMS for the HIBER UUO, as player interaction relied
on cross-job WAKEs.

What did you do about resetting?  Under TOPS-10, the hiseg would hang
around in swap-space even if no one was playing, so that the state of
the game was retained -- at least for a while; depended on how busy
the system was.  Eventually the hiseg would be flushed (and there
were ways of forcing that, either by running lots of other programs,
or fiddling with the EXE file) and the next time the game was run, it
would be in its initial state again.  Under TOPS-20, this would not
happen automatically, so I kept a virgin copy of the database file
which would be PMAPed in and BLTed over the live database when it
was determined that this was necessary.  I've forgotten what criteria
were used to decide that, but probably time since last reset and
similar.

The name is vaguely familiar, but if he's the person I'm thinking
of, he was a lecturer/researcher who arrived in my final year.


As regards getting hold of a copy of MUD to run under TS10/simh,
I see that <http://www.british-legends.com/> is running a freely
accessible version which has been ported to C++ under NT.  That
being the case, Richard&Roy might not have a problem releasing
whatever BCPL/MACRO source/executable survives, for hobbyist use.
Could mean having to bootstrap a BCPL compiler though ...

Yes I remember Valley now.  That was in the original distribution I
received from Richard. Rock (Fraggle Rock) appeared in the final
update I got from Essex before Richard left..

That's starting to sound familiar as well.

Did that as well. I think I had a program called RESET which wizards
could run manually. Can't recall how I checked for wizard status now.
Maybe gave them a password.

The more I think about it the more I'm sure we were in touch on and
off for a year or so. Funny how memory is so dodgy after less than 20
years,  I have no idea at all how you can safely convict someone based
on world war 2 witnesses 50 years later yet it happens

He could well have been a lecturer and or researcher I guess. He's now
on the DECUS UK events committee. Hey, maybe I should suggest a
TOPS-10/TOPS-20 DECUS reunion event in the UK.

Lemme think.  We got Zork at the University of Chicago around 1978, with the
ZORK.MAC frontend included.  No idea who wrote it.

(The very first patching hack I ever learned on the -20 was to JFCL the holiday
check in the .EXE with a DEPOSIT.  Nearly zorched an academic career playing
both Zork and ADVENT.)

The earliest I'd have likely written something like this was 1979 I
think. My memory may be dodgy on this but I don't think early versions
of MDL allowed you to start at offset 1 with with a file handle in 0.
If you have a copy of the MDL release notes or edit history it may
document when this change was made.

Not quite as much fun as bypassing the check with wheel though :) 

>both Zork and ADVENT.)

And I can think of several friendships ruined for ever by MUD. Plus
several made  so not all bad :)

MDL runs just fine on Tops-20, at least as of version 104.  Version 105 was a
bit problematic, but I think could be made to run.

MDL105 was how I first made CStacy's net.acquaintance nearly 20 years ago,
obtaining it for the use of the University of Chicago's then-new CS department.
Perhaps one we'll meet in the real world.
