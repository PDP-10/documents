RE: VAXELN on a VAX front end.

It was used on at least one VAX.  If my foggy memory can be relied on I
believe it was the VAX 9000.

Not quite.  MPP and VAXELN were designed for similar markets (one for the VAX
market, one for the PDP-11).  As much as I can remember the decisions to use
Pascal were made independently for each product, but for much the same reasons.

MPP never really did "fit" in the RT-11 and RSX in the same way RT-11, RSX
and RSTS were all kin.

MPP was really aimed at the small programmable controller market.  You'd have
a large machine running VMS, RSX or RT with a large number of Kxx-nn series
boards hanging off the Unibus/Qbus. You'd write your own realtime app that
would be down-line-loaded onto all the controllers hanging off the bus.

Before this product existed a customer would have to write KMS-11 microcode
to do the same sort of thing.

Since all the boards that MPP ran on were PDP-11 based, it was an easy thing
for MPP to also be supported to run in standalone fashion on any PDP similar
to VAXELN.  I also seem to remember that both VAXELN and MPP could even be
burned in ROM on a processor.

RSX-11S was nothing more then a stripped down version of RSX-11M designed
to be memory resident and down-line-loadable.  Primarily used by the RSX
customer base where they'd do their development on a big RSX timesharing
machine, and they use small diskless PDP-11's for their apps.  Similar in
many respects to the apps that MPP was aimed at, however the product line
groups and engineering groups were so far apart in DEC they never talked to
each other.

Yes they were separate products, however for a time both products were
supported by the same engineering group in the Mill.  (Until MPP was retired).
