Yes -- wouldn't it be fun to have the current high-end DLT tape technology
(70Gb on a CompacTape IV, which is not all that long, comparatively with
9-tracks), writing on a 2400' full-size magtape reel?  The mind boggles
with the thought of how many hundreds of gigs could be put there.  I would
also hope that with modern servo technology, designers could do away with
the extremely long tape paths (with vacuum columns and the like) that cause
much of the aerodynamic pain of moving the tape quickly. Since DLT format
writes fixed-sized, addressable blocks on the tape using a folded
multitrack scheme, an open-reel drive using that format would really be a
great-great-great-grandkid of DECtape!


The mind truly boggles...

Actually, 10 tracks were used to store 5 bits, of which one was clock,
one was a "mark" (framing) bit, and 3 were data. The clock and mark
tracks were written once only, during formatting of the DECtape. The
mark track is what divided up the tape into blocks, and blocks into
headers & data, and both of those into 36-bit words. The data tracks
were used in the "header" portion to store block numbers & other stuff,
but in the "data" portion they were pure user (or directory) data.

That was handled exactly the same as on disk. In fact, for all intents

was different, more tightly-encoded to save space.) The 128-word blocks
could be re-written in-place, and in fact could be read or *written*
either forwards or backwards!! [Try *that* with a 7- or 9-track magtape!]

Well, this was actually just a way to try to coerce you to READ the
tape :-)

DECtape is written with a pair of dedicated clock tracks, and mark
tracks to indicate what the data tracks contain. It is also block as
opposed to record structured. First step is to extract the block
number, and the block data by watching the mark tracks. Knowing what
format the tape was written would be helpful for the next step,
identifing the directory info, if not, you guess at where the text
files start by looking at the blocks. If you're lucky, the file blocks
will be sequential (the files were written to a blank DECtape) if not,
you have to piece them together, or figure out what the directory
format is.

It is true, but somewhat irrelevant.  Consecutive data blocks for a
single file may be spaced more than 4 blocks apart depending on how
fragmented the DECtape was at the time of writing.  Programs reading
DECtape must always follow the pointers and make no assumptions about
the blocking factor.

File data block: Word 0 is a link pointer.  Words 1-127 hold data.

Link pointer format:
  Bits  0-7	Unused
  Bits  8-17	Block number of the next block in file (1 to 577 decimal)
  Bits 18-27	Block number of the first block in file (1 to 577 decimal)
  Bits 28-35	Number of data words in this block (1 to 127 decimal)

The most efficent way to process a DECtape was to ignore block 0,
read all 74K words (332352 bytes) into memory, and do pointer chasing
on the in-core image of the tape.

*ALL* of the details on how DECtape works are in the TC11 manual that Al
referenced before.  It's in appendix A, starting on page 49 of the PDF
file.  If you think some details are missing, look again.

It's pretty dense, so *understanding* it takes a bit of study.  The
Rosetta Stone of DECtape is figure A-8 on 54 of the PDF file.

The US patent is even harder to read, and some details changed between
the patent and the real implementation.

The manual, prints, and patent can be found at:
        http://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/retrocomputing/dec/dectape/

The only differences between the use of DECtape on 12-bit, 16-bit,
18-bit, and 36-bit systems are in the data block lengths and how the
data bits are packed into 18-bit tape frames.  The mark track structure
is identical other than the block lengths.

The TC11 manual describes 16-bit and 18-bit format, which are identical
except that in 16-bit mode the most significant two bits are written as
zeros and ignored on read.  There are 256 18-bit frames in a block.

36-bit mode uses the same structure as 18-bit, but with two consecutive
18-bit frames used to store a 36-bit word.

12-bit mode is just slightly different.  They pack three 12-bit words
into two 18-bit frames.  They use a block size of 86 18-bit frames, which
works out to 129 12-bit words.

Note that LINCtape uses the same drive hardware, but not the same
controller.  It runs the tape in the opposite direction, and uses
12-bit frames with different mark track coding.  The PDP-12's LINCtape
controller supported an option to allow use of DECtape, but it did not
offer the fancy control features of a normal DECtape control.

And then there's the TD8-E "Simple DECtape Control" used on Omnibus
machines.  The hardware is simple because the software has to do all
the work.

Last night I wrote several DECtape-related programs on my Linux machine.
One tested all legal combinations of consecutive mark track codes to
verify that the eight-bit mark track decoder will never be fooled by a
valid mark track.  It works, which is not too surprising; I'm sure Tom
Stockebrand spent some time picking the codes carefully.  I wonder
whether different choices of six-bit mark track codes would have allowed
for a 7-bit or even 6-bit mark track decoder; maybe I'll write a program
to search for such a code set.

Another program will decode a DECtape image stored as 4-bit samples
(mark bit and three data bits).  Now I just need to get a raw DECtape
image into my computer to test it.  Maybe this weekend I can extract
one.

No, not usually on KL-10s.  User-accessable DECtapes were ubiquitous on
KA and KI but somewhat rare on KL.  (The DECtapes that were attached to
the console front-end were NOT assessable via the MOUNT command.)

The Colorado School of Mines had a couple hundred student-owned DECtapes
in the library when we upgrade from a KA to a KL + KS.  Because we were
keeping a lot of the KA peripherals, we ordered a KL-1091 with I/O-Bus
adapter, and two TU55 transports.  We ran into a couple of problems
getting DTB defined (no problem with just a single DECtape controller; DTA).
I ended up disassembling the DECtape formatter program, adding mnemonics
to the re-created source, and defining a feature-test for DTA vs DTB.

This relates to systems that don't have groups (eg, the 18b PDP's).

While going through the old DEC archive today, I found a box
containing manuals and design drawings for the original "Microtape"
(eg, DECtape).  This included the Type 555 transport, as well as the
Type 550 controller for the 18b systems, the Type 551 controller for
the PDP6, and the Type 552 controller for the PDP8.

The main new finding is that "Microtape" was available not only for
the PDP-6/7/8, but also for the PDP-1 and PDP-4.  I had seen a PDP-1
with DECtape at Harvard in 1969 but up until now, no literature had
surfaced documenting the interface.

The PDP-1 uses the same controller, but different IOT assignments, as
the PDP-4 and PDP-7.
