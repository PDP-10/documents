You mentioned DG's SED.  I forget which of DEC's editors that corresponds
to.  (EDT?  When I did some DG work about ten years ago I remember that
the parallels between their software offerings and DEC's were downright
uncanny.)

Others have suggested DTECO, which is (a display-friendly version of)
what DG's SPEED was ripped off from.

Do not on any account use SOS.

If you want to be a hard core PDP-10 hacker, you should learn TECO.  But
"easiest" is not a word that comes to mind to describe it.  See the
recent flamew^Wdiscussion on alt.folklore.computers.

There is a different screen editor called SED on TOPS-10.  I liked it
a lot when I was using the '-10 regularly.  I don't think there's a DG
product that corresponds to it.  It's a fairly straightforward screen
editor with a fairly powerful macro system (albeit not in TECO's
league).  There is also extensive online help as well as a printable
reference manual and tutorial.

Code is an illusion.  Only assertions are real.
