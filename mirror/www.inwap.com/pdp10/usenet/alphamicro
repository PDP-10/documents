I first (and last) saw the AM-100 in the Pasadena Byte shop about 1977 or
1978.  That was also the time when TOPS-10, and also some PDP-11 OS's were
popular.   Other popular OS were IBM's MVS, and HP/2000 TSB.

The idea of running a program by typing its name seemed new to me.    For
TOPS-10 you had to RUN or R a program.

The original developers, Dick Wilcox, Rich Notari, and John French,
worked on the original product soon after MITS released their 8800.
I don't remember exactly when, but they worked out of Wilcox' garage
and French's "The Computer Mart" in Orange, CA. Wilcox did the
OS, BASIC, and original hardware. Notari did the WD-16 microcode
which was a recoding of the LSI-11 chip set. There was an optional
"single-and-a-half" 48 bit floating point capability programmed into the
third (fourth?) prom but few, if any, declined the option.

Before settling on the AM-100 name, it was called the sixteen/eight [16
bit processor on an 8 bit (S-100) buss] and before that, it was called
the Sweet 16. I don't think any sixteen/eight or sweet 16 labeled boards
made it into customer systems. The company name is Alpha Microsystems,
refered to as Alpha below, hence the AM- product designator. They were
Alpha long before there was a Dec Alpha.

PPNs are in split 16-bit format, so the largest PPN is 377,377. There
are other accomodations for the 16 bit environment shoehorned onto the
S-100 buss. The WD-16 processor is a re-microcoded LSI-11 chipset. The
instruction set has the feel of a PDP-11. While 16 bit, the original CPU
was a two-card S100 board set connected at the top with a flat ribbon
cable. Real time clock was provided by a 60Hz 12 volt line from the
power supply. Prototype boards were usually wire wrapped, and
(initially) production boards were hand-soldered in various facilities
in Irvine or Santa Ana.

Originally limited to 64k, bank switching in 16k chunks was added later.
Playing around, the smallest monitor I could get was 16k which allowed
for three banks of 48k. Attempts to add a fourth bank and user broke the
16K monitor bank, making it 32K and allowing for six 32K users. There
was no high seg equivalent, but sharable, reentrant programs could
be loaded into system memory during boot. My above test case had no
sharable programs except when I broke the monitor size.

Alpha Micro then developed a proprietary 16 bit version of the S-100
buss. Their original 2-card, 2MhZ boar set was replaced by a double
height 3.3mHz board. None of these were sold without the floating point
option. This board was called the AM-100/T. Still limited to 64K, it
supported bank switching in 1K increments.

Later, Alpha switched to 680x0 processors and the VME buss, though the
initial 68000 board was compatible in form (but ran at 8mHz) with their
proprietary S-100 extension. They used a custom assembler reminiscent of
a PDP-11 macro assembler. They changed mnemonics, operand orders, and (I
think) addressing mode inidicators to make easier for WD-16 programmers
to adapt to the new system. This of course made it harder to go to a
pure 680x0 environment but Alpha's always been proprietary.

Their latest product is a 2.4gHz AMD system that emulates the 680x0
instruction set and has some native code. Despite the emulation, it runs
faster than their fastest 680x0 offering.

Alpha's original application language is based on BASIC. It included
HP's string indexing mechanism, as well as the string manipulation
functions of other BASIC languages. Alpha's BASIC strings can also be
indexed with negative numbers, allowing strings to be manipulated from
right to left (the rightmost position was [-1,-1], etc.) The second
operand can also specify a length (and direction) instead of position
if the operands are separated by a semicolon. No matter how strings are
indexed, they are rendered in their original left-to-right orientation.

I don't remember if HP (or any other) BASIC had these notational
extensions, nor did I think to try these out in HP Eloquence when I
worked for an HP shop a few years back. Like HP Eloquence, which runs on
HP-3000 and HP-9000 machines, Alpha's BASIC programs (or at least in the
AlphaBASIC+ incantation) can run on different Alpha architectures.

Instead of AlphaBASIC, my father sUggested the name BASIC Business
Oriented Language, or BASBOL.

I've added alt.sys.alpha-micro to the newsgroup list so others with
better memories can correct the errors I've made above.

The patch BAH mentioned (to remove the R) was also seen on PDP-8
(TSS-8). Well, not the same patch, of course, but something very
similar.
