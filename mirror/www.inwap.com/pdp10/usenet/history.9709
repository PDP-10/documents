Folks,

I would be interested in any accounts or insights into what caused Digital to
cancel the 36-bit successor to the KL10 processor.  This was announced in May
1983 at Spring DECUS.  At the time, I was a senior software specialist with
Digital and the primary -10 guy for the Pittsburgh office.  I also supported a
lot of VAX/VMS systems as well.  I worked for Digital Software Services from
1980-85.

I am specifically interested in:

- the primary cause of the cancellation (technical or business basis, or both?)
- any discussions or debates over the decision within LCG
- estimates of impact to existing customers made before the decision
- actual fallout from the decision (what customers were lost as a result)

If you would feel more comfortable sending e-mail, please do so.

Thanks,

George

   This, of course, begs the question: "Where's the VAX now?"

   Given the architecture of the VAX, with its' rather bloated
instruction set, there's no way that the raw speed could have
approached that of a cleanly-designed -10-based implementation.

   The PDP-10 (and its' progenitor, the PDP-6) had one of the finest
instruction sets known to man; it combined simplicity of implementation
with elegance that remains unmatched to this day. While I might not
be the biggest fan of the KL- implementation (it was a decent,
workable, mid-life design), I think that a modern -10 design would
be a machine to reckon with. I suspect it would lend itself to ASIC
silicon rather well, and might achieve a good bit of parallelism in
the process. (How many SMP -10s can we pack on a single die?)

	I can't offer too much in the way of internal knowledge of what
was going on in DEC's collective head at the time of the cancellation,
but I can offer this interesting sidebar:  the day that the cancellation
was announced was also the day that the Russians shot down flight
KAL-007.  I was working at SRI at the time in the Network Information
Center.  Up to this point in time, we had NEVER seen the network so
congested.  Of course, at that time, the backbone of the ARPANET was
56KB lines, and the military traffic used the same lines as did the
limited commercial traffic and the university traffic.  We could not
quite figure out if the traffic was due to the cancellation of Jupiter,
of the downing of KAL-007.

	From what I heard from a friend at DEC, the prototype for the 
Jupiter was very erratic.  There could be as much as a 3:1 difference
in it's performance during test benchmarks between runs.  The prevailing
theory as I recall was a design flaw in the pipeline queue that caused
the pipeline to stall.

It would be interesting to know who "spring1" is. At the time I was Director 
of Systems Development for ADP's Network Services Division. We were one of 
DEC's National Accounts, and I sat in on many "non-disclosure" presentations 
on the Jupiter. I took copious notes and still have my notebooks from that 
era. ADPNS was LCG's largest customer. We had over 100 PDP-10's of one sort 
or another, all running TOPS-10. During 1982 I was involved in negotiations 
with LCG on the Jupiter implementation of TOPS-10. We (ADPNS) had done the 
portation to the KS-10 (2020), and as LCG was firmly committed to TOPS-20 
they were once again looking to us to do the portation. The last notes I have 
on the subject are dated 9/21/82, a meeting with John Montesian, Don Turner, 
and Chuck Pickel. At that time Jupiter product announcement was scheduled for 
12/82, first TOPS-20 customer ship for 6/84, and first TOPS-10 customer ship 
6/85. BTW, in my notes the Jupiter is referred to as a 4050, although in 
earlier notes it's called the 2080.

The surprising thing is that I've scanned my notes from there to the Las 
Vegas DECUS, which began 10/24/83. The term Jupiter never appears, which I 
find somewhat surprising. I guess the death announcement was such a big deal 
I didn't think I needed to take notes about it. Today I wish I had.

I do recall that there were significant technical problems with the 
prototype(s), mostly imvolved with the EBOXes pipelining. DEC was looking at 
a complete redesign which would have pushed the product schedule out at least 
a year. They were concerned that by that time they would probably have been 
introducing an obsolete product into a market increasingly dominated by 
"power of two" architectures. That and the apparent success of the VAX line 
led to the decision to put the Jupiter project out of its misery.

While it's easy today to take shots at the VAX, it was a huge success in the 
late '70s, early '80s. IBM was scared to death of it, so much so that the 
4341 was being referred to internally as "the VAX killer".

At that time, I was manager of DEC operating systems development and
Technical Services at American Management Systems. We were smaller
than ADP or Compuserv, but not tiny. We had six KLs running Tops20,
monitor sources and more than a thousand incomming modems....

I too heard early discussions of serious pipelinging performance
problems. We were nearly desparate for a four times performance
increase, we were turning away customers who wanted one
huge machine supporting large commercial database work.
And the HSC70 wasn't the equivalent to a mainframe channel
as advertised.

Given today's knowledge of the sensitivity of heavily pipelined
processors to optimizing compilers, combined with the LCG 
community's love of Macro-10/20 programs (All of the OS, nearly all
the CUSPs, languages except for Fortran, and the ever popular System
1022). it isn't even clear that a multi-stage heavily pipelined
processor running typical 10/20 program mixes could have
delivered much without all sorts of pipeline stalls. [no modern
load/store RISC machine attempts to do KL effective address
calculations, etc.].

> That and the apparent success of the VAX line 
>led to the decision to put the Jupiter project out of its misery.

I think a major problem with LCG was the success of the larger Vaxen.
The Vax community was not nearly as hard to support as those of us
in LCG. They would put up with whatever DEC sold. There was a lot of
internal politics inside DEC at the time, so much so that it was
obvious to outsiders.

There were also a number of secondary issues, which may have combined
to kill LCG. These included:

1) KO's reported death fear of competing too closely with IBM. As LCG
machines got bigger and 438x systems (with VM/CMS) got cheaper,
the difference were no longer quite so clear. [Not that I think
a 438x with VM/CMS is even in the neighborhood of TOPS-20]

2) limited heavy duty resource availability to do design work.
Not long after the Jupiter was killed, while in MR01, I was told
that the circuit simulations for both the Jupiter and Vax8600 were
taking much more resources (KL time?) than earlier boxes, so 
part of the rationale for killing the Jupiter was that it would free 
modeling cycles for the 8600 and followon machines.

3) inability to develop a TP monitor for heavy duty transaction
processing. I know there were several efforts within DEC to 
build something to remove the converstational nature of Tops-10 and
Tops-20 jobs, so that hundreds and thousands of terminals could
execute the same job streams. At least one product was fairly
far through engineering before it was killed, at least in part
to avoid #1 above. At one point, we were offered that product,
complete with sources, if we'd just run it commercially [I know, why
ruin a nice OS by adding CICS to it, but that is what at least a
portion of the large commercial shops wanted....] .

Somewhere in my boxes of stuff, I have micro-cassettes (from a dictation
recorder) of the Las Vegas sessions.  I really must find them, and get the
exact wording of Ralph Gorin's famous remark.

It was in a room on the top floor of a hotel, when DEC was telling us that
two VAX-8600's and a VAX-780 had the combined computing power of a single KL.
And that the problems they had in clustering that much CPU power together
would be fixed by the time VAX-clusters shipped.  Ralph said something
like:
	What your asking is for us to jump out this window, on the
	assurances that the holes in the net below will be mended
	by the time we get there.

This would have been the perfect opportunity for Systems Concepts to take
orders for their "Mars" 36-bit processor, but the head of the company was
a perfectionist, and would not announce the product until the hardware
was prefect.  He missed the window of opportunity.

In an archive of this newsgroup from last year I came across a thread about
DECsystem-10 timesharing systems on Long Island. The thread referred to LIRICS,
NCODE, and NAG.

Since I was one of the original staff of NCODE, I thought I might share
a little history and also maybe find someone from my past at the same time.

In 1975, the Nassau County Board of Cooperative Educational Services
obtained their own KA-10 (R109 I think) to offer the same sort of
service that LIRICS was offering in Suffolk county.

At the time I was a night-shift computer operator for an IBM 360/30
in the same room as the DEC-10 was being installed into. This was located
in Westbury at the BOCES County Center.

Being bored with loading cards into the 360, I started to mess around
with the DEC-10 which was running overnight disk diagnostics. I really
messed things up and was almost fired for it. But instead they offered me
the job of system programmer to learn from and take over from the DEC resident,
Pat Sweeney.

At the same time, BOCES hired Bob Liquori and he and I became NCODE. We worked
out of two desks in the telephone equipment room and supported users at
many Nassau County High Schools.

After a few years NCODE obtained 2 PDP-11/70s running RSTS/E and these
replaced the -10 for educational computing. The -10 then became abusiness
applications platform (accounting, etc).

NCODE grew and I stayed with it until 1979 when I went to work for DEC in
Colorado Springs as one of the first members of the Telephone Support
Center on the RSTS/E support team.

I could say lots more but I'm not even sure anyone cares.

I remember learning MACRO-10 and a lot of Monitor internals because the
system crashed so often due to hacking by our wonderful students!

The story was that the LICUS meetings (I never went to one) were used to
exchange tips on how to crash the NCODE DEC-10. This is ultimately why
the instructional service (mostly BASIC programming) was moved to RSTS.
We had to get the students off of the -10.

Once I started working on the -10 I got a crash course by attending
Assembly Language Programming, Advanced ALP, Monitor Structure, and 
Monitor internals in Marlboro. I also learned a tremendous amount from
Pat Sweeny whose initial advice to me was to get listings of the entire
monitor, "You'll need them", he said and he was right.

A couple of the courses I tookk in MR  were taught be Dave
Cressey (Hi, Dave) who I recently ran into when he did some consulting
for my present employer. I still have my "diplomas" from those courses.

The NCODE -10 was a refurbished KA-10 with 4 MA-10s, the PDP-11/40-based
front end (I can't think of the name), TU10,  and a couple of RP02s. If I remember
correctly, we couldn't boot directly from disk at first and had to use paper
tape. Eventually the system was upgraded to boot directly from disk.

We had something like 20 dial-in lines, telco DAAs mounted on the wall, that
over time were replaced by dedicated circuits to each High School. One of the
biggest advances in those years was the switch from teletypes to LA-36s. 

Video terminals were unheard of. Everything was hardcopy. I was very good at
Teco on a hardcopy terminal. It wasn't until I went to work for DEC that
I worked on my first VT52. 

Well, I need to get to work.

Regards,

Brian

Ah yes, the same Dave Doxey who on October 27, 1983 gave a major part of 
DEC's presentation at the 10/20/VAX Migration User Panel session during the 
Las Vegas DECUS. My notes have him as "DEC Internal MIS".

Found it.

From audio tape 83267-3300 "Technical Comparison of TOPS-10/20 to VAX/VMS".
DECUS in Las Vegas, October 1983.

[This excerpt taken from approximately halfway into side 1 of the tape.]

    Ralph Gorin, Stanford University.

Well, I've listened carefully to the "Integration Plan", as such, and alas,
I'm unimpressed.  The Integeration Plan, so far as I understand it, is:
  I'm supposed to walk to that window and jump out, on the assurance that
  the holes in that are in the net below will be fixed by the time I get there.

...

I am looking for an assurance that Digital will NOT do something
And the thing that I want you to not do is:
  I want you to promise to not obstruct our efforts to find third party
  manufacturers who will build us hardware so that we can run the software.
  ...  want you to unbundle everything.  Which is to say, license to
  all those who want it, all the software packages that you now posses.

[Both comments received wild applause from the audience.]

Well, back in '81-82, I answered SPRs for galaxy on the '10s and '20s.  Our
group's offices were in the same building as the Jupiter and Venus (aka
8600) groups; I had to walk by them to go to the cafeteria.  I didn't have
any close ties with either group, but I was in a position to hear things.

What did I hear?  Lots of the crazy rumors that we've all heard over the
years.  But the truth as near as I could tell was that Jupiter would have
been a fractional improvement in speed over a KL at a cost way out of
proportion to the performance improvement.

Contrast this with Venus (which was being developed at roughly the same
time) -- a good solid performance bump for a reasonable amount of money.
It was simply a more cost-effective solution, and the powers-that-be knew
customers would compare the two systems, and that Jupiter would've only
been a viable product for a very small portion of DEC's 36-bit customer
base.  The fact that VAX was DEC's most recent architecture certainly
didn't hurt Venus, either.

When they gathered the Technical Support Group to tell us that Jupiter was
being canceled, people started jumping ship -- some to the SuVAX
(VAXstation prototype) project across the hall, others left the company
entirely, and one or two, I seem to recall, actually ended up getting into
VMS Engineering.

However, there was still a solid core of individuals in the 36-bit
engineering and support organizations that remained for quite some time.
Probably the biggest tragedy of that whole era was that a lot of good
people and a lot of good technology went down the drain with the 36-bit
systems.  As I recall, the attitudes between the VMS and LCG organizations
were fairly antagonistic at the time.

I knew it was time to move on when I was eating lunch in the BU cafeteria
and a customer from the U.S. Navy noticed the sailboat on my badge.  Almost
in tears, he begged me to tell him what I knew about Jupiter, and that the
project he'd been working on for the past five years would be down the
tubes unless he could get a faster 36-bit processor soon.  I wanted to tell
him to get his resume current, but I couldn't.  I hated that...

I was on the fast path for a Jupiter (Boston U), having taken delivery
of a brand new 2060 in June 1983, DEC came over that summer to pitch
the Jupiter to us and how great it was going to be. I think I remember
speaking to Roseanne Giordano the day after announcement, on the
phone, it was more of a lost opportunity for DEC than us since BU
spent most of its money on IBM mainframes, the academic side went on
in other directions, Sun etc.

Wasn't there some story that the senior CPU architecture designer for
Jupiter got deathly ill a coupla months before deadline, hepatitis or
something like that, and a more junior fellow took his place. The
latter had all these different ideas he felt had not been given
sufficient shrift by his now out of the way superior, made a lot of
changes to the design, and it just didn't work so there was your
"performance problem".

I dunno, maybe it was an apocryphal story.

All right!  THAT'S ENOUGH!  AFAIK there exists only one person left alive 
that can tell the real story and s/he doesn't seem to be willing to tell it 
  I had not realized that this was the flavor of the speculations back 
then (I was not allowed to attend DECUS after the announcement that 6.04 
was going to be the last TOPS10 monitor).  No wonder there was such angst 
when the Jupiter cancellation was done!  I, for one, was glad that it 
happened because it gave new life to the software (TOPS10 and TOPS20) side 
of the PDP-10 product line.

This is an apology for yelling in a post I made a few days ago about the 
above subject.  [Note to HWM:  I was _not_ yelling at you; it just happened 
that it was your post that was on my screen when I lost my temper.  So I 
owe you personal apology if you thought my post was directed at you.  I 
assure you, it was not.]

I have my own speculations about why Jupiter was cancelled.  However, I do 
not plan to voice them here because they are speculations.  JMF and TW did 
not tell me what was going on at that time.  If they (especially Jim) 
wanted to keep the facts of that situation private, I am going to respect 
their decision.

Now, the reason that I was happy the day the announcement happened was 
because I knew that the money in the PDP-10 budgets would be directed into 
Software Engineering's pot rather than in [what seemed at the time] the 
black hole of the Jupiter project.  TOPS10 was getting very little funding 
and we were hurting.  I am not speaking for TOPS20 because that wasn't 
where I worked.  Because of the new funding that Software Engineering got 
after the Jupiter cancellation, we were able to hire _more_ people.  A few 
of the really good ones that come to mind are Carl, Dawn and Bill.  We got 
funding for implementing such things as DECnet, new peripherals and other 
things that I can't remember.  

If the Jupiter project had been allowed to continue the way it was going, 
none of this stuff would have been done.

Again, my apologies for yelling; for those of you who know me, I did edit 
out a lot of blue material before I clicked the send icon [smiling 
emoticon here].

Hi, all,

DEC was also June 6th, some year.

I'm not sure of the exact date, but you're in the ballpark. Hell, I can't 
even remember the date I started at DEC, but it was in the summer of '66. 
Tony had only been there a month or two. He was my office mate for the first 
year or so we worked at DEC. He was my close friend much longer. We both 
lived in Holliston at that time and regularly car-pooled the 20 or so miles 
to Maynard. We kind of lost track of each other after Tony left DEC (I had 
left years earlier). I could fill many screens with TW stories, but I'm not 
sure anyone would be interested. I was really saddened when I learned of his 
death. I'm glad he's still remembered in this forum.

JMF was one of the architects of the implementation and wrote a paper about 
the techniques he used.  He also did SMP on a Unix OS but I don't know any 
of those details.  I don't know where this paper resides so I'm posting to 
a group that is read by the keepers of such lore.

Wow... I haven't touched on this subject in a while...

"mainframes" and "pcs" in general have a very large thing seperating 
them.  PCs tend to focus on processor acrhitecture, while mainframes 
focused more on "systems architecture" of which processor architecture
is an important part, but just a part.  PCs are starting to get into 
system architecture a little bit, but since they generally are starting
from scratch, and many of their designers are not familiar with the 
lessons provided by the history of mainframes, they are in many cases
reinventing the wheel (note that most of the "good" things in windows/NT
are from DEC mainframe land, and most of the good things that were 
taken OUT of NT by the microserfs were taken out because they didn't
really understand them...) 

Because of this, people are always astounded that a 1 MIP KL10 was
able to do the work it was (it did it because it had a lot of help 
from the rest of the system architectual elements) and are quite 
often disapointed at the bottlenecks that they run into in a 
100 or 200 MIP "pc" where the CPU is like lightning, but it can't
overcome the shortcommings of the poor systems architecture that it
has been inserted in (or in many cases the poor ways that the OS it
is running handles some situations).

I think that a lot of good knowledge has been lost in terms of 
systems design.  The 10 series left things on the floor when the 
VAX people refused, and then only grudgingly, took some of the 
righteous things from the 10, and in general I think that the 
PC world would benefit form looking at some of the ways that it
was done.  Faster CPUs are not everything...

I was an operating systems programmer at DEC from 1966 to 1974, the last five 
years in the PDP-10 Monitor (TOPS-10) group. After leaving DEC I remained 
close to the -10 as a customer until 1988, thus thought I knew all the key 
people involved in TOPS-10. Since I started monitoring this group a few years 
ago the name Allan B. Wilson has appeared a couple of times, and each time I 
thought, "Who the hell is Allan B. Wilson?" Last night it finally hit me, 
Allan B. is Pete Wilson's real name! Can anyone confirm my epiphany?

I can.  They're two different people.  Alan worked for Alan Titcomb (? I 
think that's the name) in marketing.  I don't remember when he first 
appeared but I seem to recall that he did some special development work on 
the 1091.  When he left DEC I think he went to Atlanta but I cannot recall 
the company.

I don't remember what happened to Pete Wilson.

A mainframe was typically a machine with separate I/O processors (in
IBM parlance, "channels") which normally had independant paths to
memory (no single bus.)

For example, to perform disk I/O on a 370 you created a channel
program in memory which the IOP executed directly (think of it as
another CPU living off the main system's memory.) Besides all the
obvious stuff ("get me this block") the IOP could do things such as
search a range of tracks for a particular data key (match, high, low,
etc.)  Large 370 mainframes had 16 then later 256 separate channels
(well, you bought as many as you could afford, but "up to...") These
allowed true I/O parallelism, you could have a disk farm all lit up
doing operations simultaneously, including transferring data to/from
memory without contention (i.e., no serialization over a single bus.)

In some sense all the other terms, mini/micro/pc, refer to just a
progression of making a simple computer (single I/O bus) smaller and
cheaper. I suppose the important distinction is that PCs center around
a motherboard, whereas minis were typically a rack of boards (CPU
board, memory board, serial I/O board) on a common backplane such as a
Unibus.

Anyhow, in this world of fascination with prices and CPU clock speeds
it's not surprising that people have trouble understanding that
mainframes were defined by their I/O speed and generally only required
to have adequate ("balanced") CPU speed so that wasn't a choke point
for the I/O.

For example, I remember being awed at watching a 3090 (big IBM 370
architecture mainframe) simultaneously reading and/or writing 8 tape
drives at what looked like fast rewind speed, 250ips, when my
supposedly high-end minis would stop/start and stutter, maybe on a
good day stream for short bursts, trying to turn one tape drive.  I
remember that mainframe could read or write a tape in about 2 minutes,
several of them simultaneously, where the minis could easily take an
hour, even with high-end tape drives (eg, TU78s.)

 In fact the terminal channel on the 370/165 in Cambridge was replaced
with a PDP11 (an 11/10 IIRC) which did ascii-ebcidic, line editing and
a few other odds & ends and allowed TCAM to be replaced with the much
smaller & simpler parrot.

 CDC may well have done the same thing.

That was a function of the complexity (and therefore the price) of the
systems.  The low-end IBM S/360 machines, for example, had the channels
built into the main box, and these channels were serviced by the CPU
circuitry.  This meant that whenever the channel had an event that
required more than minimial processing, the active task in the computer
was effectively suspended while the CPU cycles were used to process the
I/O event.  Such events included starting or ending any channel control
word (a CCW, the opcode that directed the channel and device), as well as
periodic loading and unloading of buffers as bytes moved between the
I/O device and main memory.

Such configurations were called "cycle-stealing channels".

Except for performance, this was totally transparent to the operating
system; it generally needed only to tell the channel logic to start
an operation, and later responded to an interrupt telling it that the
channel had finished.  CCW handling and channel buffer management
needed no assistance from the OS.


The same design was used for the integrated control units in the low-end
4300-series IBM boxes, where you could have not only data channels, but
device controllers built into the main computer box.  Having a lot of
high-speed (for that day) communications lines could place a quite
heavy load on the CPU and cause significant reductions in throughput.
Each system with these cycle-stealing control units came with a manual
that stepped you through the calculations to see how bad it could be.

The higher-end models of all of the IBM mainframe lines used channels
and control units that had their own dedicated logic to control the
operation, and required only an arbitration mechanism to mediate access
to memory once the I/O operation was begun.

I believe that the front-end to the later IBM 3084Q in Cambridge was also
PDP11-based. I think it consisted of racks of PDP11/34's (which replaced
11/45's some years ago, but the system was essentiall unaltered apart from the
change in CPU).

Some of the 11/34's were stuffed with DZ11's and DJ11's that provided the
async lines. They communicated with 'master' PDP11/34's using DMR11's and
DMC11's. There were also DUP11's in there somewhere - maybe as interprocessor
links, maybe as sync line inputs. The 2 master PDP11/34's talked to the IBM
channel using a couple of DX11's (8 rows of flip-chip cards that linked the
IBM channel to Unibus. Somewhat impressive to look at!).

I am fairly sure about the model numbers of the cards used, but exactly
how they were all interconnected is a mystery to me, alas, so the above is
somewhat guesswork.

Micromainframe(tm) is (or was) a trademark of Intel(tm), for the iAPX-432(tm).
But they haven't used the trademark in years, and perhaps they aren't
claiming it any more.

All of the iAPX-432 systems I used weighed more than 50 kg, so by
Andrew K Bressen's criteria they would have been minis.

They were so slow and had such low I/O bandwidth that it's not clear why
Intel thought that Micromainframe was a good name for them.  On the other
hand, they had a very intriguing object-oriented capability-based
architecture.  It was a fun machine to play with, even if it wasn't
practical for anything.

I would have removed alt.sys.pdp10 from the Newsgroups: header, except
that I found out (just recently) that all of Intel's early iAPX-432
development tools ran on the DECsystem-10.  The tools that they released
or sold to customers ran on VAXen under BSD 4.1 and were written in
Berkeley Pascal.

Cheers,
Eric

   Other than a common manufacturer, the two share very, very, few
similarities. The two have widely divergent bus structures, instruction
sets, word sizes, and memory capacities. They are quite un-alike.

   The KL-10, though, did use a PDP-11/40 to spoon-feed its brains to
it at power-on. (Sorry, KL-10 fans.)

Ah, yes, the SA-10 interface adapter.  Systems Concepts' first product.  When
they were still in the 36-bit computer business, they included an SA channel in
the SC30M (and other members of their line), so the one I ran at Stanford had
the StorageTek drives talked about in another thread, along with RP07 and RA81
disks.

As a matter of fact, when they first delivered it, the MI (Massbuss Interface)
channel was no yet available, so we had to use the SA channel to connect to
some IBM 3380 single-density drives we happened to have in the room, so we
could bet Tops-20 running on the thing.  (Mike and Stew were much more at home
with Tops-10.)

And that's only from the hardware side.   I remember one morning, after a 
particularly difficult session debugging his new magtape driver, TW glared 
at an offending magtape drive and declared that "God never meant for there 
to be magtapes."  [chuckling emoticon here]  We waited until we got out of 
TW's range before we laughed.

Oh, yea...After developing/maintaining BACKUP, I agree.

Just to enlarge a bit on what Chris said.

You mean the HSC-50, followed by the higher-performing HSC-70 and HSC-90,
and the cost-reduced HSC-40. Yes, they indeed had/have PDP-11s in them, but
the PDP didn't do the actual work of flinging the data around; dedicated
microprocessors on controller cards that spoke directly to the disks and
tapes did the work; the data was then moved to/from the CI bus using a
different controller card.  The controller cards plugged into a high-speed
bus.  Their overall activities were controlled by the RSX-11 derived code
running in the 11, but it did NOT actually do the bulk of the work.  It
would never be up to it.

The disks were Digital's own SDI-speaking disks:
RA60/70/71/72/73/80/81/82/90/91/92 etc.

It also supported TA-variants of the common Digital-repackaged tape drives,
like the TA78, TA79, TA90, TA92, etc.

The very latest descendants, the HSD-xx/HSJ-xx/HSZ-xx use a third-party
controller card set (I forget the vendor), with a common version of
firmware. The disks are now fast SCSI-2 and/or fast/wide SCSI-2.  SCSI tape
drives (DAT, DLT, 9-track, and (i think) 8MM) are supported.

All three controller families support hardware striping, mirroring, and
RAID 3/5.

HSD-xx controllers use DSSI to speak to the host(s). Each "disk unit"
presented to the hosts looks like a DSSI disk with dedicated controller.

HSJ-xx controllers use MSCP to speak to the hosts over a CI bus. It looks
to the hosts much like an HSC-xx.

HSZ-xx controllers use fast/wide/differential SCSI to speak to the hosts.
Each "disk unit" presented to the host looks like a SCSI device on that
bus.

There are also variants of the HSC series that use a fiber-optic
interconnect between the controller and the hosts.


I may have a couple of minor details wrong in the above descriptions, but
this is generally what the lay of the Digital land is for "independent"
disk controllers (i.e., ones not on a system's backplane bus).  If I've got
it wrong, please let me know!

I didn't know we even supported those with the advent of SMP; I am amazed. 
For oldtimers, remember SV2EXE (guess I may not...that doesn't look right).

Chortle.  Nowhere.  Here's how I did my first one.  I read CREFed listings 
of SCAN and WILD, and any other program that used them _properly_.  DIRECT 
was an example.  Then I tried to write the program.  (Now JMF taught me to 
do this.)  When I became so confused that I didn't know my ass from a hole 
in the ground, I asked an "expert", where expert is defined as someone who 
wrote a SCAN/WILD interface before me.  Of course, we were fortunate 
because we could always ask the developer/maintainer (Hey, Bob!)[grinning 
emoticon here].

Just a note:  Even though Jim managed to write an interface in user mode 
(FILDAE.MAC), he never, ever admitted it to anyone with the intention of 
avoiding the label of SCAN expert.

Not surprising.  Hmmm....Was the ability to use SCAN/WILD a rite of passage

   For some odd reason, I doubt it. Perhaps that was one of the very
reasons why the -10 was a successful as it was - people who were new
to the machines _had_ to learn from experienced folks.

   In learning the ropes from more experienced individuals, newcomers
got a hefty dose of understanding about the machines based on the
teacher's level of knowledge and exposure. What few books existed
were pretty paltry, but the best instruction most always comes from
someone who already knows the subject, and has screwed up in the
past (if they're any good, they'll tell you about it, too, so you
don't make the same blunder).

   Does this mean that the world of the -10 is an "oral tradition"?

	I think so, or something similar.  My first week at DEC, I had 
to sit by the elbows of two senior engineers and watch them debug a 
system crash, and otherwise be their gofer.  Then, after I had this
impromtu "crash" course, they told me to go figure out why a customer's 
card punch was throwing out a duplicate card after they refilled the 
hopper.  Damned if I didn't find the "JRST .-n" off-by-one bug within 
a couple of hours, and fix it.  They were shocked - they had never had a 
"newhire" catch on and fix a monitor bug that quickly.

	(I've been wanting to tell this CDPSER story for a while - yes, 
folks, it was I who found and fixed that duplicate card problem.  The
driver would jump back to the DATAO instruction when it detected a
hopper emptpy after punching the card then doing a CONI, instead of
advancing to the next buffer.)

	Then they had me write some code to use the DAEMON FACT. function,
and I found a bug in DAEMON.  But that's a story for another time.

Ah, Joe.  I'm deep in the golden mists of aging memories and up you pop 
reminding me how it really was in those days [sighing emoticon here].  

You will never know how close we came to _not_ supporting CUSPs because of 
the mess we had with multiple copies of pieces of software that was stated 
in the SPD as Category B support.  No matter what the legalese said, fixing 
bugs in that software was at the behest of the programmer and it really 
depended on how much time was available (which was almost non-existent).

The suggestion that all CUSPs no longer be supported was brought up and 
seriously considered.  Just as a side note, the CUSP tape started as a "oh 
by the way, customers, we found this software to be rather useful; maybe 
you will, too".  It would not have been unprecedented to just ship the 
CUSPs on a Customer Supported Tape (or not at all).  I seem to remember a 
maintainer in a meeting (and this could be a memory error) considering all 
the SPRs he could close and get off his backlog if we did drop support.  At 
the end of the discussion, he exhorted that the developers never tell the 
other maintainers since most of them would have supported the notion.

Also, as another side note, in those days the developers rarely saw SPRs.  
After SPRs were answered by the maintainers, packets of them were delivered 
down the hall to the developers who rarely had time to go through them.  
Sometimes, when taking a break, a Bulletin would be rumaged through.  Only 
if an SPR presented a bad design flaw, or was a serious system breaker 
preventing the customer from doing work (this was 99% monitor software) 
would a maintainer walk down and talk to a developer.  

We "improved" our methodology as time went on.

Yup.  We would have been shocked in the 80s, too.  We usually figured 3-6 
months for "breaking in" a programmer; (we gave 1 year to supervisors :-)).

The tradition of sitting and watching the senior developers look at crash 
dumps never stopped until Jim and Tony went away.  Part of most people's 
morning ritual was to get a cup of coffee, go across the hall to the 
machine room, and find Jim and Tony looking at dumps at the console.  Their 
preference was always the KI.

One of the things that the kiddies never understood was the role of being a 
gofer.  It was an honor and part of the breaking in ritual; I remember a 
female being very offended that she was asked to get Jim coffee while he 
was fire-fighting at a customer site (she had no idea what he was doing, by 
the way).

No. The conversion was done before the KL was glint in anybody's eye, IIRC. 
 Now, let's see if we can reconstruct what was happening then.  The EXE 
file eliminated the high and low segs being in separate files.  VM was 
being done around then (that was the significance of uping the monitor's 
version number from 5.xx to 6.xx); and this is KI days...not KL.  EXEs came 
with LINK V5.0.

That's about how things evolved.  It also helped that one of the midnight 
projects of Pete Conklin (who, I think, wrote SCAN and WILD) was to convert 
some of the major CUSPs to use the interface.  There were times that this 
was not a popular idea.

_I_ liked it [grinning emoticon here]

Monitor or DAEMON patch, but not quite as difficult

Well, maybe as a user mode programmer.  TW and JMF were not user mode 
programmers; I don't recall TW ever touching SCAN and WILD.  Here's a JMF 
story to illustrate his inability to do user mode programming.

When he began writing the FILDAE, he ran into a slight difficulty; he 
couldn't lay out a programming structure to do I/O in user mode.  Remember, 
he did everything in exec mode.  Now, this was all done on his weekend time 
which was the time he reserved for doing fun things.  Since, it was the 
weekend, there wasn't anybody to ask how to do the I/O.  He raided my 
office for documentation (Monitor Calls Manual) [grumble...leaving a mess] 
and couldn't figure it out.  So this man went into the machine room, set a 
breakpoint, and wrote his I/O routines based on what the internals of the 
monitor did when his user mode program executed the I/O monitor calls.  And 
that, boys and girls, is how Jim wrote and debugged the FILDAE...with EDDT.

In the eight years I spent at DEC, I at one time or another shared an office 
with both TW and JMF, and counted each of them among my best friends. During 
what I consider the most groundbreaking period of TOPS-10 development we 
constituted 60% of the monitor group. That being said, I think there's been a 
tendency here to greatly romanticize our accomplishments. Remember that 
companies who relied upon the DEC-10 for there livelihood needed good monitor 
people to keep things running. The quality of the software was that bad. I'm 
a living example, I was lured away from DEC by a timesharing bureau waving 
more money than I could see earning at DEC in several years of raises.

During TOPS-10's formative years DEC was a real meritocracy. In the 
Programming Department, the monitor group was the top of the pyramid. The 
PDP-10 monitor was a going concern before either TW, JMF or I joined the 
group. Over a period of years we supplanted the "founding fathers", who 
included Tom Hastings, Don Witcraft, Dave Plummer, Dick Gruen, Chris 
White, and others who's names I've forgotten. 

It should be noted that there was precious little attention given to formal 
quality control. Tom Hasting (to his credit) tried to create an automated 
test suite at one time, but after he left the group it quickly fell out of 
date and its running was abandoned. It wasn't until years later I heard the 
term "regression testing", but in retrospect that was exactly what Tom was 
trying to initiate. We were too arrogant and shortsighted to follow his lead. 
Keeping the test suite current with development was seen as just too much of 
a pain in the ass.

To our credit, the peer pressure within the group was intense. Any quality 
built into the monitor was due more to the need to not be seen screwing up in 
front of the group than concern for customers. During the period I was 
responsible for magtape support, we had the "MTREQ goes to -2" problem. (BTW, 
another example of why customers needed monitor programmers on staff, 
patching MTREQ back to -1 in the running monitor freed up the hung magtapes.) 
I still recall how fanatically I undertook this bug hunt, particularly since 
so many others had failed to find it. It wasn't because of concern for 
customers (after all, they had a "get around"), it was because I wanted so 
badly to be the person who cracked the tough one.

Having over the years managed a number of software development departments, 
I'm not so sure I'd like to manage a group like the late 60s, early 70s 
TOPS-10 group. We were way too elitist and arrogant, and practically 
unmanagable. It's a good thing we could back it up with performance.

	Yes, as I recall now, weren't certain locations of JOBDAT
"depreciated", meaning that they no longer had a purpose in later

	That was spooky in it's own right.  I mean, COBOL was pretty 
straight forward - it basically generated threaded code with parameter
lists and called LIBOL to do almost everything.

	The Fortran compiler was down right eerie.  It was almost as
if the compiler could read your mind and perform a DWIM.  I spent a
morning rewriting a customer program for a benchmark one time, to
attempt to get a little more efficency out of it.  The object code
generated by the orignal version and my hand optimized version were 
almost identical.  After a while, though, I got so that I could
predict what sort of object code the compiler would spit out.

	Yep, a feature I sorely missed when attempting to debug a tape
driver problem at a customer site, with their System's Comcepts SA-10
controller.

	A customer needed a way to charge back to individual departments 
for each use of certain programs.  The best way, we determined was to 
use the FACT. function of DAEMON.  Now, there was a problem, as only
privileged code could call some DAEMON functions.  So I wrote, first, 
an ugly little hack that used PEEK./POKE. to change the PPN to [1,2]
to allow the DAEMON call to work, then back to it's original PPN.

	The second problem was that the FACT. function would fail
silently, giving the impression that it had indeed worked, when in 
fact, it had appended nothing to the FACT file.  It turned out to
be an off-by-one bug - if the amount of data that you were attempting
to log was exactly 16 words, the maximum allowed, which of course was 
the size that I was using, it would fail.  Simple enough to fix, but 
a real bitch to track down.  Even at that, I had to use byte stuffing
to get all of the required data into one FACT entry.

	Now that I think of it, this may have been the only customer
site using that function.

	This was long before, of course, TOPS10 supported the USAGE.
UUO, which made the job much easier down the road.

Actually, F10 was purchased (sometime around '67 or '68, I think) from an 
outside contractor who's name I've long forgotten. I don't recall there being 
any ex-monitor folk involved.

While I'm here typing, and the thread is "Scan/Wild" after all, I seem to 
recall another parser caller SCNNER (or something like that). When I was 
working on DAEMON (making DUMP and DCORE work with VM, a non-trivial 
exercise) it seems to me it was built with a different parser than SCAN. 
Anyone have a better memory than I?

CSC?  I may have it mixed up with a really amazing Fortran for the Philco 2000
from around the same era.

F40, bless it's twisted little heart, had been hacked on by some of the old
hadrware/monitor crew, from the original Digitek code  Tom Eggers, in 
particular, wrote the common sub expression hackes (accor4ding to the comments,
anyway).  I spent many happy hours trying to figure out how it worked (or what
the instructions did, since it was writtne in machined code for pseudo 
hardware).

No, the 2020 was supposed to be 20% of a KL.

CSM (the Colorado School of Mines) upgraded from a 192K KA to a KL and a KS.
A particular job that took an hour to run on the KA took 10 minutes on the
KL and 50 minutes on the KS.

   KL-1091 = 1 * KL
   KS-2020 = KL / 5
   KA-1050 = KL / 6

There was one test that the KS was really slow on: buffered disk I/O.
It could only do 60 blocks per second (one per disk revolution).
The RH11 disk controller ran in 18-bit mode, using the parity lines as extra
data lines.  It could transfer several consecutive disk blocks into
contiguous UNIBUS virtual addresses.  But consecutive disk blocks going into
different buffers (each with a 3-word buffer header) required CPU intervention
and the CPU was not quick enough.  (The RH20 did not have this problem since
it had an alternate set of registers, so the 2nd command could be loaded
into the primary registers by the hardware when the 1st command was done.)

A typical read of 3 blocks, using TOPS10 buffered I/O, was:
  Locations N through N+2 were the 3-word buffer header.
  As were locations N+203 to N+205 and N+406 to N+410.
    Read 128 words into location N+3 to N+202.
    Get interrupt from RH11 disk controller (running in 18-bit mode).
    Tell controller to read next block into locations N+206 to N+405.
      Oops, the disk sector is already partway past the read heads.
      Wait for sector to come around again.  Transfer data.
    Get interrupt from RH11 disk controller when transfer is done.
    Tell controller to read next block into locations N+411 to N+610.
      Oops, the disk sector is already partway past the read heads.
      Wait for sector to come around again.  Transfer data.
    Get interrupt from RH11.
  Done.

And someone else mentioned that it was a small system.

Actually, when I got on board at Digital (oops, I mean DEC) in 1983 in
their Internal Software Services group,  TWINKY had just been re-potted
from the KS-10 it had lived in to a 1090.  The KS was used to run TOPS-20,
and was called TWONKY.  (That system was an interesting story in itself, as
the TOPS-20 support people in my group managed to get V5.x of TOPS-20 to
run on that beast. Amazing what you can do when you have sources.)

 I ended up being in charge of the Monitor builds on TWINKY until I went to
the DEC-10 development group in late 1986.  After being made aware of the
true name of the SET HOSTES command (remember, Monitor command tables only
held 6 characters/entry), I changed the ID string in the Monitor (printed
out when it booted and every time INITIA and LOGIN ran, and advertised on
the ANF-10 network) to be "Hostess Twinky" followed by the version/build
info.

There's still a TWINKY system inside Digital, but, alas, it's no longer a -10...

Or one could read the TOPS10 module that implemented the device.  I 
remember the frustration that TW had when he was trying to write the RH20 
driver.  Out of that came a document (written by Tony whilst he was 
debugging the hardware) called "Tony in RH20 Land" or "I Should Have 
Listened When Mother Told Me There Was A Great Future In Encyclopedia 
Sales".

Is that document in the archieves?

One of the real frustrations in dealing with post-TOPS20 devices is that the 
engineers sort of forgot that not all I/O operations start and end at a page 
boundary. I recall the nastiness I had to dig through when I implemented the 
RH11/UBA driver for the KS10. 

Later when I was managing software development at ADP's Network Services 
division we implemented CI20/HSC50/RA?? support in TOPS10 for DEC. We had 
this strange data corruption problem which occured once in a blue moon. After 
months of bug chasing we found that the microcode in the CI20 couldn't handle 
"gather writes" properly, but only during an error recovery retry. By that 
time the guy who implemented the microcode at DEC was long gone and it took 
what seemed like six months or so to get DEC to correct the problem. 
Meanwhile we had thousands of dollars of "new technology" sitting around 
useless because we wouldn't subject our clients to a known data corruption 
potential.

Well, at the 30th Anniversary get-together at the spring DECUS in DC, Clive
Dawson and I ended the session with an invitation to all to attend the next
planned event, the 36th Anniversary.  That assumes that DECUS will still exist,
and that *someone* will still be willing to schedule a session for us.

We had a pretty good turnout, with attendees including the DECUS Board, and
Roseann Giordano, who was forgiven her announcement of the Jupiter Cancellation
by acclamation.

I'm maintaining my DECUS membership just so that I can answer the Call for
Sessions in 2000...

I checked out the picture, and although I recognize most of the faces find I 
can't put a single name to one. What's worse is that I worked closely with 
many of them while porting TOPS-10 to the KS. Sigh!

I took the .jpg, blew it up, and applied a smoothing algoithm, and I can't

Well, I took a look (you realize that I sacrificed a lot since using AOL's 
web browser now means that it's top level software won't work for weeks 
now).  The picture was a blur; I had a _lot_ of &nsbp characters sprinkled 
all over the place.  So until someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong, I 
can't help you.  One of the blobs looked a lot like Ted Hess; he had 
a distinctive facial configuration.

Yes, quite true. I was in the Monitor Group when David Stone announced at one 
of our regular Monday morning Monitor Group meetings that he had had this 
epiphany over the weekend and had decided to call the Monitor TOPS-10 (for 
Timeshared OPerating System -10). We all thought the name sucked. As I recall 
we left the meeting shaking our heads and chuckling under our collective 
breaths. We thought it sounded too much like a Saturday morning AM radio 
show.

I often wish I had a map of The Mill with the building numbers on it. I 
remember where that meeting was held which helps with chronology. The group 
started on the first floor of Building 12 (I think), migrated to the second, 
then third floor, then to the top floor of what I recall as Building 1 (it 
ran east/west and connected 12 with 5), where KA-10 System 2 was located. We 
were there when DS made his proclamation, which makes it perhaps 1970 or 
1971.

The Group later moved to the top floor of Building 5 before departing for 
Marlboro in 1973.

Which reminds me (for some strange reason), how many others remember 
(accurately) the origin of the name Leprechaun Lounge for a conference room 
in the Marlboro facility? I'll bet the story has been through a few 
permutations over the years.

Nope.  Building 3 and it was the 5th floor (there were 6 in building 3).  
You had to go up to the 6th floor in order to get to building 21 which 
housed field service at the time.

Right. You guys were on 3-5 when I started working at DEC which was July, 
1971.  I think it was later in the year (or maybe the beginning of the 
1972) when you moved to 5-5.  IIR, there wasn't enough space for the second 
processor to implement the master/slave configuration.  Remember the 
slanting floors on 3-5?

I was back in the mill a few weeks ago (it is really sad seeing it
so empty... I found the places where my office(s) used to be, all
there are are impressions in the rugs of the partitions).

I was helping someone find their way around the mill, and specifically
showed the area on 3-5.  Starting at the bldg.5 end of 3-5, the parition
walls come to the top of my head, and although they are level for the
length of the building, about 30 feet down the hall, the floor buckles
enough for me to easily look into an office over the partitions.

Neither do I... and I worked on ML5-5 from 1978 to 1988

Because, as I understand it, the monster Bryant disk drives originally planned
for the 10 _had_ to be on the first floor.  The Mill flooring couldn't hold
them anywhere else.

The text in the timeline may be more accurate, "DIGITAL is the first computer
company to connect to the ARPAnet. The connection is made via a PDP-10."
I have no idea who did that, even though I left DEC in 1978.

The PDP-10, of course, was on the net much earlier as several TENEX
systems (possibly all of them) and a few TOPS-10 systems.  The early
code was written at Harvard, C-MU got involved around 1970/1.  I took
over the C-MU work in 1972 or so.  After the main Harvard devo went to
Xerox PARC (1973?) and I went to DEC (1974), Rutgers put a KI-10 on
the net with our help (1975).

I believe I installed the first FTP client in 9/1972 just before leaving
for a vacation in Europe for a couple weeks.  When I got back there
were servers to talk to, and I found my client didn't work.  Fixed
quickly, but I'm not sure if I installed the first _working_ client.
Ed Taft at Harvard wrote the TOPS-10 FTP server.  Later he wrote the
server for the "new" Telnet protocol and I wrote the client.

BBN built a hardware pager for the KA-10 as part of an ARPA-funded
project to bring virtual memory to the PDP-10.  The other part of the
project was TENEX, which ran on these modified KA-10s (and later on
other models).  At that time Dan Murphy was at BBN.  TENEX came with
him to DEC, where it transmogrified into TOPS-20.

And well before BBN did this, paging hardware for the KA-10 was built
in the MIT AI Lab by Jack Holloway.  It was used for running ITS.

So far, so good.

PA1050 got its start on Tenex.  When a program did an MUUO, if the "enable
10/50 compatibility" bit was set (and it normally was), then the monitor
would automatically load <SUBSYS>PA1050.SAV and give it the trap.

TOPS-20 version: When a program did an MUUO other than JSYS, if the
"enable TOPS-10 compatibility" bit was set (and it normally was), then the
monitor would automatically load <SUBSYS>PA1050.EXE and give it the trap.

Once PA1050 was loaded, it would get all subsequent MUUOs directly.
PA1050 lived in the high end of the address space, at about 700000.

LOOKUP and CALLI were both implemented by PA1050.  JSYS isn't much
different in concept from CALLI, except that the AC argument was ignored
by JSYS.

Paging hardware for the KA was built by both BBN and Systems Concepts.

Systems Concepts pagers were used on ITS machines.

BBN pagers were used on all KA Tenex systems as well as the WAITS system
at Stanford.  BBN pagers had what was later called "KL paging" or
"microcode paging" in pretty much its full glory (or the Model A
equivalent thereof: direct/share/indirect pointers, SPT, CSTs, etc.) and
added JSYS as a machine instruction.

JSYS was a pure code JSR; the effective address pointed to a word in which
the left half contained a pointer to a place to save the old PC, and the
right half pointed to the new PC, hence:
	JSYS [RET,,SUBR]
called a subroutine that would look something like:
SUBR:	...
	JRSTF @RET
If E was less than 1000, then it would get the JSYS pointer from physical
memory (I think that it added 1000, so JSYS 23 uses physical 1023 -- I'd
have to check my Tenex manuals to be sure) and leave user mode.  If E was
greater than 1000, then it would get the pointer from user space and stay
in user mode ("user mode JSYS").

Tenex on the KI used the KI's pager, and JSYS was implemented as an MUUO.
The KI pager was very poor, so KI Tenex did not perform all that well in
terms of timesharing over KA Tenex, but it did crunch numbers a bit
better.  KI Tenex systems were often dual-CPU, and found more favor in the
AI community than with more timeshared environments.

TOPS-20 implemented the BBN pager (and later went beyond it on Model B).
JSYS was still implemented as an MUUO.  From time to time, I've thought of
implementing JSYS in microcode on my KS just to see if it would do any
better.

User mode JSYS fell out of favor after KA Tenex, but even the latest
versions of TOPS-20 still implemented it to support old software that uses
it.  It's very slow, since it's an MUUO.

With one notable exception.  If the MUUO was GETTAB [CALLI 41] and the
contents of the accumulator was the right value to get the operating
system type, then TOPS20 would provide a return value without invoking
PA1050.  This was so that programs could determine at run time whether
they should use MUUOs or JSYS for the remainder of the program.

Late in the game for TOPS10 7.0x, I got Jim Flemming to add a code for
TYMCOM-X, the PDP-10 operating system used by Tymshare, to the list of
legal return values.

	The system hung in a strange and bizarre way that I could not
explain.  All of the subsystems were unresponsive.  I finally had to 
break into the Front-End console and halt the system.  And, actually,
over the years, I think that DAEMON evolved to mainly a super mode user

TOPS20 - I don't recall to what extent, if any, PA1050 "supported" the

Understood.  My whole being was dedicated to keeping TOPS10 viable.  There 
wasn't any time to learn to love TOPS20 although I respected the work and, 
generally, liked the people.  It's a psychological thing that I'll probably 
never completely get rid of.  :-)

Gad. I hope not other than a POPJ P,  .  Maybe it was one of the SYSERR
aspects of DAEMON.  And, you're right, it did end up as a very priviledged 
user mode program.  I don't know what the original plans were for a 
swappable monitor segment.  Hmmm.  I can't remember who wrote it.  I know 
that Cliff Romash did a bit of work on it (time frame = early Marlboro 
years).

The PDP-10 emulator on the Gates Alpha is the Harrenstien KL10B version.

Oddly enough, we received an order for a Toad-1 from Paul Allen about that
time.

Actually it might not be that odd, the DECtapes that Paul Allen's guy brought
me to read were old enough that they probably dated back to when Gates and
Allen were using a 10 at Harvard, so maybe they both want to play with their
old toys.  I see Paul Allen's web page has a pointer to Inwap so I suspect
he's got the Toad because he's interested, not just because he's trying to
preserve some boring old application.  It's great to see those two messing
around with stuff from the days before programmers forgot how to program!

When the PDP-10 Programming Group moved from 3-5 to 5-5 in 1971 or 1972, 
Allan Pommer was put in charge of the logistics. He helped layout the 
offices, cubes, and conference rooms. One of the things he did was pick out 
the colors. He came around one day with one of those paint company color chip 
cards to show us the colors he had picked. I seem to recall there were three 
conference rooms in the new layout, and Allan picked out three different 
colors for them. One was a very pale green the paint company called 
Leprechaun. Allan named the three conference rooms after the colors he 
picked, calling the green one the Leprechaun Lounge. I can't remember the 
names of the other two.

The regular Monday Morning Monitor Group meetings were always held in the 
Leprechaun Lounge. When we moved to Marlboro, for some reason the name 
followed. The place where the meetings were held continued to be called the 
Leprechan Lounge, even though the walls were no longer Leprechaun. After a 
while the Monitor Group meetings were moved to a different room, but this 
time the name didn't follow.

Does anyone know if there's still a Leprechaun Lounge at DEC? Come to think 
of it, is there still a Marlboro facility at DEC?

In my recently acquired copy of "digital Building Blocks, computers, systems"
published by DEC in 1960, the following paragraph is repeated at the end of
each of a number of sections:

  DEC  Programmed  Data  Processor-3   (PDP-3)   --   a large
  scale,  solid state,  general purpose digital computer with
  the same high speed and high reliability as the PDP-1. Also
  a  single address,  single instruction,  stored program ma-
  chine,  PDP-3 operates in parallel on 36 bit numbers.   The
  main  storage  is  coincident current  magnetic  core  mod-
  ules  of  4096 words  each,  with  a  memory cycle time  of
  5 microseconds.

This version is verbatim from the end of DEC Publication number B-3000
dated 11/60; the same text is at the end of DEC Publication B-100 dated
7/60, C-4000A dated 11/60, A-710 dated 8/60.

So, while DEC may never have built a PDP-3, and while only one may have
been built, by a customer, DEC did advertise it as a product, if only
briefly!

The spiral bound set of DEC publications I got includes a whole section
of material on the PDP-1, including photos, but nothing but the above
paragraph on the PDP-3.

Oh, I wasn't claiming that TOPS10 had coined the term.  I was just 
speculating that the letters didn't come from cybercrud.  Programs were 
called daemon if they worked in the background doing nefarious things that 
nobody understood and had the power to make life really miserable if one 
wasn't good [emoticon with a twinkle in it's eye].

Bob Clements, who lurks here but never posts to avoid spam, emailed to remind 
me that 1)the JFFO first appeared on the KA, and 2)there were significant 
changes to the suite of floating point instructions and data format between 
the -6 and the KA. I'd forgotten about the floating point changes, probably 
because in years of writing MACRO code, I don't think I ever wrote a floating 
point instruction. Bob should know, he and Alan Kotok were the logic 
designers on the KA.

Although Dick Gruen had business cards that gave his position as "Factotum", 
Bob was the real factotum at DEC. In addition to his design work, he also 
spent some time in the Monitor Group. After he had left DEC for BBN, we spent 
some time at one of the Monitor Group meetings trying to come up with an RCC 
STOPCD in "honor" of Bob. Since he had spent some time working with SCNSER, 
Don Lewine suggested it would only be right and proper that the RCC STOPCD be 
in that module. Eventually we came up with "range check chunks", and so it 
was.

In a late '50s or early '60s "Encyclopedia of Computing" or somesuch (I 
don't have the exact reference handy), there is a two-page blurb on the
PDP-1 and the PDP-3. The blurb concentrates on the PDP-3 and mentions
the PDP-1 only as an 18-bit version of the PDP-3.

The only thing resembling technical information in the blurb is a
drawing of the instruction word. I don't have the photocopy I made
handy, so I can't reproduce it at the moment.

The volume in question had two-page blurbs on just about everything
starting with ENIAC and going to some Ramo-mumble 5-processor mainframe.
It was really interesting, but I didn't think I could get away with
swiping it...

BTW, unless I listened incorrectly, Art Bell's guest on Monday claimed
the PDP-1 was designed by space aliens.

JFFO was not in the original instruction set of the KA which
was first shipped in DEC 1967.  It was was added in 1968 as
the 366th instruction in honor of 1968 being a leap year.

Just kidding.  Although it was mentioned.

I had the pleasure of having the office (5-5 Pole 41A) adjacent
to the double office RCC and AK shared in the Summer of '68
when JFFO was added.  It was done at the request of a prospect
who was trying to code a minimal execution time 'population
count' routine and promised to become a customer if it was
available.  I don't remember who it was or whether they
actually bought a machine.

>That would have been the NSA, right?

Wrong. What follows is an excerpt from a 1992 posting by Bob Clements (RCC).

--------------Beginning of quoted material---------------------
JFFO was added very late in the development cycle, at the request
of a potential customer.  The customer was a European telephone
exchange maker.  They wanted to use it to scan for changed bits
representing phone line occupancies.

This change was, of course, a new incompatibility with the predecessor
machine, the PDP-6, so we were reluctant to add the instruction.
We asked Marketing how many machines we would sell if we added it.
They said "At least 5 for a testbed, and hundreds if they decide
to go ahead with the design."

So we added it.  It was 1968, which was a leap year.  I wrote the
blurb for the internal Sales Newsletter, proclaiming that in
honor of Leap Year, we were increasing the number of instructions
in the machines instruction set from 365 to 366.  I still have
a copy of that newsletter somewhere, I think.

End result:  The potential customer never bought a single machine.
-------------End of quotation-----------------------------------

The above reminds me, during the early years of the -10, DEC marketing seemed 
to always be seeing potential sales "if only we could implement (your feature 
here)". My entry into the Monitor Group was via one of these schemes. Someone 
thought we could sell x number of machines if only we had a Real Time 
Monitor, so a group we formed to create one. I was Group Leader. My "group" 
consisted of Jim Flemming and Kerry Bensman. The object was to create an 
"uber operating system" that would preempt the running Monitor (not yet named 
TOPS-10) to provide service to some external stimulus. After several months 
of design and coding, but before we could even get to debugging, Marketing 
identified yet another way to sell systems. Jim was pulled off the project to 
work on the ORELA (Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator) machine, I was 
pulled off to turn LOADER into a "virtual memory" loader so several customers 
who were "loaned" memory so that they could link the monitor would either be 
forced to pay for it or give it back. I don't recall what happened to Kerry.

At the end of my little project, which produced a horrible abortion known as 
MONLOD (MONitor LOaDer), I was absorbed by the monitor group. First task; 
implement extended RIBs.

Well, I've looked for my instruction set card and now can't manage to find 
it, so I can't answer the question for sure.  There's a TW story connected 
with JFFO.  

Tony always said that, when writing code, he constantly looked for a 
legitimate opportunity to be able to use a JFFO instruction.  One day, he 
came back from the hardware lab (I can't remember if he was coding the RH20 
or the RP05s) and announced to Jim that he got to write a JFFO.  He looked 
like he was on cloud nine.

Yup. Term attributed to M. J. Bailey circa 1964.

The TOPS-20 IMAP server used JFFO three times, to translate between a
bitmask of flags into an index into a vector of pointers to the flag
names.

I was particularly proud of that program.  It was the last major assembly
language program that I ever wrote, and perhaps the only "true" native
TOPS-20 program ever written.  There was no JOBDAT or section 0, not even
a vestigal trace; it compiled and lunk in section 1 using PSECTs and PDVs.

From its inception, it was designed to run in extended addressing; it made
good use of OWGBPs and MOVSLJ [I later regretted that decision, since that
meant it couldn't run on my 2020...].  Of course, it used the infamous
MACSYM macros -- there was not a single JRST to be found. 

Alas, it was deployed only on a couple of TOPS-20 machines; SUMEX-AIM and
SIMTEL20 are all that come to mind.  I sometimes think that IMAP could
have saved the PDP-10 -- it was a *great* IMAP engine, much better than
UNIX -- but IMAP didn't start taking off until the mid-1990s, nearly 10
years too late.  I doubt that anyone other than me used its on SIMTEL20.

It never went beyond RFC 1176 support (basic IMAP2); if I were to bring up
an IMAP server on a TOPS-20 system today I would probably think more about
building the UNIX server than doing the work to write a MIME parser in
assembly language.

In any case, it was a loving tribute to the most wonderful machine
architecture ever designed.  I'll be nice to you TOPS-10 and ITS folks and
not say "and the best operating system".  ;-)

I was going to argue about "the only 'true' native" by pointing to the XKL
version of Tops-20 itself (no section 0, etc.), but a case can be made against
it since it was *not* designed to run in extended addressing from its start, a
fact we have had reason to curse for years...

That's a wink, ma'am.  I often use ";->" which is a sardonic grin and a wink.
(Or perhaps it's a smirk and a wink?)

I distinctly remember a DECUS session some time around 1976 at which
the TOPS-10 folks proudly announced that they had dramatically sped up
SCNSER by using JFFO on all those tty input mode bits.

If I remember correctly, L M Ericsson was the non-customer that wanted JFFO
in the first place.

It's gonna be a little hard to find a PDP-6; only 23 were ever made, and I
think most were junked decades ago.  The last one that I know of was installed
at the Stanford AI Lab until the fall of 1984, when it was taken to DECUS for
the 20th Anniversary event, then shipped to the Computer Museum in Boston.  It
was apparently sold on little chunks by the folks there, instead of receiving
the caring treatment it deserved.
