BOCES/NCODE (Nassau Computer-Oriented Directions in Education), KA #109;
County Center, Old Westbury.  The site's nickname in Suffolk was NOCODE,
because MACRO-10 and DDT-10 were protected to reduce hacking.  It was
replaced with at least one 11/70 running RSTS within a year or two after
1977.


I also used BOCES/LIRICS KA #105 in '74-'75.

(Do you recall the LIRICS KS serial numbers?  I'd never heard the KA was
replaced with other -10's).
