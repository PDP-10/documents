At one time or other, the following links existed. I have not tested
them at this time.

(From "THE DECSYSTEM-20 AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY (1977-1988)" by Frank da
Cruz and Christine Gianone, http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/dec20.html)

"Meanwhile, as the computer industry struggles to turn PCs into
 multiuser systems and to reinvent multiprocessing, security, and
 other forgotten concepts, it might profitably pause to look back at
 the past decades, when the expense and limitations of computing
 equipment forced designers and coders to be... well, smarter."

Re: EXTEND, MOVSO

Ralph Gorin is alleged to have commented on the pdp10 string 
instructions during his time at XKL. The COBOL compiler is
said to have relied heavily on these instructions.

  None of these is fast.  None of these is thoroughly tested.  They
  all require a lot of registers for setup.  They are uncharacteristic
  of other PDP-10 instructions.
