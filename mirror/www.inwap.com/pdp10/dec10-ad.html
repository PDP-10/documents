That's not just our opinion.

<p>The DECsystem-10 is the number one choice of independent timesharing
beureaus.  And these are companies whose computers are their lifeblood.

<p>Moveover, we conducted a survey of EDP managers a short time back.  It
showed that Digital was rated higher in timesharing by people who knew
our systems than was any other manufacturer by people familiar with their
equipment.

<p>There's a good reason for all this.  You can't buy DECsystem-10 equipment,
features or performance anywhere else for the price.

<p>From $300,000 to $2 million.

<p>$300,000 buys you a powerhouse 36-bit computer with 64K words of core,
magnetic disk, line printer and 16 communication lines.  And you can expand
smoothly from there up to a much bigger system, using the same operating
system, just by adding hardware.

<p>But you may not have to expand that fast or that frequently.  The
DECsystem-10 spends about 90% of its time on useful work, unlike many
systems which waste a load of time keeping track of things.  That's because
the DECsystem-10 was designed specifically for a multi-task environment,
while most other machines were designed for batch processing and are trying to
perform like something they're not.

<p>All of which means you've got to investigate the DECsystem-10 anytime
you have a situation where a number of sources ueed the computer at the
same time.  As in networks.  Or hierarchies.  Or any mix of batch, program
development, EDP, timesharing, or real time.

<p>DECsystem-10. From Digital, the world's leader in timesharing systems
with 1,000 timesharing systems installed.<br>
