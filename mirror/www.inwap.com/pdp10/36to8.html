RFC-959 describes the FTP protocol, and refers to TELNET's NVT-ASCII.<br>
RFC-854 describes the TELNET protocol.<br>
RFC-683 describes how to deal with TENEX files with holes.<br>

The PDP-10 systems (TOPS-10, TENEX, TOPS-20) store 36-bit data in
128-word blocks or 512-word pages.  Transferring files to 8, 16, 32 or
64-bit systems requires data conversion.

<H1>FTP</H1>
FTP uses three primary modes for exchanging data between dissimilar systems:
<ol>
<li>NET-ASCII - each line of text is terminated by a &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; pair.
   Bare &lt;CR&gt; characters are transmitted as &lt;CR&gt;&lt;NULL&gt;.  Data is sent
   as 7-bit USASCII in 8-bit bytes.
<p>
   On PDP-10 systems, &lt;NULL&gt; characters are stripped out, and LSN
   (Line Sequence Numbers) from editors like SOS are optionally removed.
<p>
<li>BINARY - the input file is a contiguous stream of bits.  Starting
   with the most significant bit of the first word, data is transmitted
   8 bits at a time.
<p>
   On PDP-10 systems, this can be done by reading the file a nybble at
   a time with a 4-bit byte pointer and sending each pair of nybbles as
   8 bits.
<pre>
   Byte 9*n+0 = bits 0-7 of the even numbered word (starting with word 0)
   Byte 9*n+1 = bits 8-15 of the even word
   Byte 9*n+2 = bits 16-23 of the even word
   Byte 9*n+3 = bits 24-31 of the even word
   Byte 9*n+4 = bits 32-35 of the even word &lt;&lt; 4 + bits 0-3 of odd word
   Byte 9*n+5 = bits 4-11 of the odd numbered word
   Byte 9*n+6 = bits 12-19 of the odd word
   Byte 9*n+7 = bits 20-27 of the odd word
   Byte 9*n+8 = bits 28-35 of the odd word (ending with word 0177 or 0777)
</pre>
<li>TENEX mode (Local Bytesize 8) - tells the TOPS10/TOPS20/TENEX system
   to use a byte size of 8, 16 or 32 when reading/writing its file.
   This uses only bits 0-31 of the 36-bit file; bits 32-35 are never
   sent when reading and set to zero when writing the 36-bit file.
</ol>
FTP also defines a fourth mode for sending TENEX files a page at a time.
This allows files with holes in them to be exchanged between 36-bit
systems, but is not for exchanging data between dissimilar systems.

<H1>1/2-inch tape and KERMIT</H1>

In addition to those methods, two others are useful:
<ol start=4>
<li>ANSI-ASCII / KERMIT-36 - the 36-bit word is broken up into 5 bytes,
   the first 4 use only 7 of the 8 bits, the last one uses all 8 bits
   and has its MSB set only if bit 35 of the word is set.
<pre>
   Byte 5*n+0 = 0 &lt;&lt; 7 + bits 0-6 of word
   Byte 5*n+1 = 0 &lt;&lt; 7 + bits 7-13 of word
   Byte 5*n+2 = 0 &lt;&lt; 7 + bits 14-20 of word
   Byte 5*n+3 = 0 &lt;&lt; 7 + bits 21-27 of word
   Byte 5*n+4 = (bit 35 of word) &lt;&lt; 7 + bits 28-34 of word
</pre>
   Note that a 36-bit binary file can be transfered to an 8-bit system and
   then back again without losing any bits.  PDP-10 text files are readable
   asis when transfered to CP/M, MS-DOS, and anythine else that uses
   &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; as the line separator on disk.
<p>
   Later versions of TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 had tape controllers that used
   microcode in the tape formatter to do this sort of bit shuffling.
<p>
<li>UNIX-ASCII - like ANSI-ASCII, except that &lt;NULL&gt; characters and &lt;CR&gt;
   immediately before &lt;LF&gt; are discarded, and bit 35 is always ignored.
<p>
   This mode is something we used in-house to write to 1/2-inch tapes
   in 'tar' format.  The idea was to create a tape that could be
   used on our UNIX system with no postprocessing.  This meant that
   file 36-bit file had to be read from disk twice: once to calculate the
   byte count for the 'tar' header, and another pass to write the data.
</ol>
A method of storing 36-bit data as 6 bytes of 6 bits each on an 8-bit
medium is less efficient than the methods above.  It was mainly used
only for bootstrapping a PDP-6, KA or KI from paper tape.  In this
application, simplicity of hardware was more important than efficiency.
