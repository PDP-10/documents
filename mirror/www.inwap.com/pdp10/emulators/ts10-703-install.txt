Subject: TOPS-10 v7.03 Install Proceedure      3/11/01 7:46 PM

The following is a *Rough Draft*, but it should be enought to get a system
setup.

Installation of TOPS-10 v7.03

I'm guessing this might be of use to some people, and it can serve as a
starting point to a better document.  I'm sure it's in need of corrections,
as I've doubts as to wether or not the system is coming up right.

The following procedure is mainly based on stuff Greg Satz, Parag Patel, and
Timothy Stark have posted.  I'd figured out a lot of this, but this looks a
lot better than what I'd done :^)

Based on Mark Hittinger's comments about the RIB errors which I'd noticed in
my first install, I've used 1990 as the year in the following and it seems
to have not had any problem.  I believe others have done this giving the
correct date without any problem though.

STEP 1.
First get the following tapes from http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com
> BB-X138B-BB   KS Bootable TOPS-10 v7.03 tape
> BB-X140B-SB   TOPS-10 v7.03 Monitor sources
> BB-X128B-SB   TOPS-10 v7.03 w/sources #1
> BB-FP63A-SB   TOPS-10 v7.03 w/sources #2
> BB-FP64A-SB   TOPS-10 v7.03 Tools w/sources
> BB-X130B-SB   CUSP w/sources

You can also get the sources for the ts10 emulator here.

STEP 2.
Apply the following patch and build the ts10 emulator.

diff -c -r1.1 system.c

        text7[p] = 0;

        return text;

        }
        text7[p] = 0;

        return text;

        int36 idHom = util_PackedASCII6("HOM");
        int36 dAddr36;
        int36 data36;

        int36 idHom = util_PackedASCII6("HOM");
        int36 dAddr36;
        int36 data36;

STEP 3.
Startup the emulator.
