	<p>Lemme see.  Ken Harrenstien (KLH), still at Oracle I think, wrote a
	<A HREF="klh10.txt">KS-10 emulator</A> years ago; that's the one I've seen running on Macs
	(including the PB145).  KLH later revised it to emulate a KL-10B, and
	tried to sell it through Digital as an Alpha Migration Tool; I don't
	know that anyone ever bought it from Digital.

	<p>Then there's Stu Grossman, who wrote <A HREF="kx10-log.txt">kx10</A> while working at Stanford.
	I saw an early version running on his office Sparcstation; I know he's
	kept playing with it over the years.

	<p>So that's three.  There are others (one written in PDP-10
	assembler, to emulate upwards to a new implementation of the
	architecture) of less use to the general populace.

Daniel Seagraves has shelved his E10 emulator.

<H1><A NAME="dzclient">DZCLIENT</A></H1>

Daniel Seagraves added a DZ11 module for Tim Stark's <A
HREF="#ts10">TS10</A> emulator that allows multiple users to telnet into
the virtual PDP-10.

	<p>ftp to sakura.lunar-tokyo.net, it's in pub/dz11_new.tgz.
	This is a tarball you unpack over the current TS10 code to get
	ts10 and dzclient.  They still communicate by shared memory, but
	it's interrupt-driven, so dzclient is normally sleeping unless
	it is signalled to do something.

You can log into Daniel's Linux PC running ts10.

<blockquote>
	21-May-2001

	<p>Telnet to asuka.umtec.com, and Linux will answer you and ask for a
	username.  Tell it "ts10".  When asked for a password, press Enter.

	<p>You will get the message "DZclient v0.0" and be told your
	line number.  Lines above 6 currently do not work.  I don't know
	why yet.

	<p>At this point, you either struck out (got line #7 or higher)
	or are talking to TOPS-10.  Push enter and wait - You should get
	a dot prompt.  If you struck out, push control-backslash ( ^\ )
	to tell dzclient to free your line and let someone else use it.
	If you just close your telnet connection without doing this,
	you'll hang the line and make it unavailable to anyone else.
	(I'll fix this later.)

	<p>If you got through to TOPS, you should be able to type "LOGIN
	42,2" to get logged in as NOBODY.  There is no password on this
	account.  If you want your own account (I dunno why...) bug me
	and I'll make one if I have time.  I'm somewhat busy today.

	<p>If it tells you you're already logged in, that means the
	previous person forgot to log out - I haven't implemented
	carrier control on the DZ11 ports yet. ^_^

	<p>If you're finished with what you're doing and want to quit,
	give the command KJOB (K for short) to log out of TOPS-10, then
	control-backslash to kill dzclient.  I have to reboot every few
	days so the ts10 debug log doesn't fill the hard drive, but
	that'll generally be announced.

	<p>Oh yes - The machine playing host (Asuka) is a Pentium 233 -
	It's old and slow.  Please be patient.  When a lot of terminals
	are active (typing something out) at the same time, it can get
	pretty pokey.
