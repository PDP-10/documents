The TYMCOM-X Operating System was based on the TOPS-10 Monitor, version 5.02C.
It had some TOPS-20 features added, such as memory-mapped disk I/O with
all disk structures based on a 512-word page instead of a 128-word block.

As long as you're in the mood to add things, here are some facts about
Tymcom-X that don't appear anywhere else:

Tymcom-X was based on 5.02C, not 5.04. Bill Weiher rewrote the file system
to make it much more reliable. He also removed mountable structures because
he wanted to make the system operator proof . . .

We used SOS as the editor for most things while I was at Tymshare. That's
because Bill Weiher wrote it while at Stanford, I believe.

Other interesting facts about Tymcom-X:

*) Was a completely virtual memory system (user level, no swappable monitor
parts). User programs could provide their own working set handler or use the
default built-in to the monitor.

*) I reason to believe that Tymcom-X was the first pure VM operating system
to swap working sets as opposed to re-paging the pages in after they were
robbed for another job. TOPS-20 didn't page working sets in and out, mostly
because they originally had a paging drum with fixed heads (no seeking).
TOPS-10 swapped jobs in and out even after VMSER was written (by Jim
Flemming, my mentor at DEC, unfortunately no longer with us). Paging for
TOPS-10 happened after a job was swapped in, and went back and forth between
memory and the job's currently allocated swap space. I eliminated the double
overhead of nested memory managers (paging within swapping) when I designed
the virtual memory system.

The first versions of VAX-VMS did what other VM systems didn, the pure
Denning and Coffman page replacement only style of VM. Later, they found out
in practice what I suspected; its very inefficient to do lots of single page
I/O in a storage system with physical head positioning. Later versions of
VAX-VMS adopted a working set swapping scheme similar to mine.

*) Tymcom-X had a simple built-in interlocking system called "clubs",
intended to allow programs to implement their own more complex interlocking
system.  The Magnum people didn't like it; they wanted a more complex
locking system.  We resisted this because the Tymcom-X monitor had no paged
areas, and memory in those days was very expensive, and there was in general
bound to be multiple implementations of interlocking for each major
application.  (I had to squelch a lot of conceptually good ideas because of
practical reasons, which didn't make me very popular. I was the manager of
the Tymcom-X OS group during most of the radical rewrites, from 1977 to
1981).

*) Tymcom-X had simultaneous update in the file system, implemented along
with the first version of the VM rewrite came up. This change, and the
memory mapped change, was motivated in part to allow multiple users to
update two or more records that happened to reside in the same page in the
file system.

*) Tymcom-X had the most sophisticated process control mechanism existent at
the time that I know of; I found later that it was far more powerful than
Unix's, which only had enough features to implement the shell an no more.

There was a capability system that allowed control of functions that you
could perform on another process, such as read memory,
write memory, cause software interrupts.  It was as powerful as TOPS-20's -
and we had an invisible debugger (IDDT) that I implemented for application
developers and to test the system.

*) We also had an efficient way to jump between processes called "gate
jumps"; you could jump in and out of various address spaces with no context
switch at will.  This was a great help to Magnum, since we only had 256K
words of address space.  DEC solved this limitation by implementing extended
addressing, which would have been a very extensive project to implement for
us at Tymshare. The gate jump (Allen Ginzburg's idea, the overall manager of
Tymcom-X development during most of the time I was there) was a quick
alternative to extended addressing. We had implemented most if not all of
the features you'd want to integrate a large application such as Magnum in
the process control system.

The overall project was called "forking and gating", since you could fork
off a process with the new process control stuff, and gate jump directly
into it after you had loaded the part that you wanted.

(The limitations here were that processes still had exclusive access to open
file channels and such, so one process couldn't run a channel that another
process had opened. We didn't see this as much of a limitation
theoretically, since if you modularized your code properly such things would
be local and not global. And shared memory pages allowed common memory space
between all processes. But I guess it turned out practically to be a problem
for things like Magnum that weren't organized into seperate sub-processes
when originally written.

*) Tymcom-X was a *pure* VM system, not a hybrid between the old style
monolithic memory system and a VM system. There literally was no old style
I/O; it was all simulated in a module written by Art Atkinson named SIMIO.
This was a tall order, because it had to simulate both buffered mode and
dump mode I/O with the file system. Pages not associated directly with
files,

*) We had an accounting system which had to be consistent so that the
customers would be charged fairly. There was a hairy formula that converted
all sorts of usage figures into one metric, the TRU. Virtual memory caused a
quandary for this formula, since memory usage was one of the elements of
TRUs, and the user could set their own working set.  The problem with this
is that we wanted to be able to make best use of limited physical memory
resources; this meant that if you ran the same program the same way
successive times, you might get different amounts of physical pages each
time, since the monitor wanted to give you more memory if it was available
than your user working set defined. So we just invented a "monitor working
set", which was the actual working set the system used. You got charged for
the user working set only, but the monitor working set could be bigger or
smaller than the user working set was. This way we got the best of both
worlds, consistent TRUs and the ability to optimize system performance.

*) Tymcom-X had a "quick disk check" mode of DSKCLN which 80% of the time
was sufficient to bring a system up quickly after a crash. This is something
that Microsoft still doesn't have.  Since we had a bitmap in the file system
of pages that were mapped at the time of a crash, we could check only the
files that were open for consistency rather than having to check each and
every file.  Only bugs in the file system's allocation could force us to
have to do a full DSKCLN. This was implemented by a very bright guy named
Todd Corenson with a little help from me.

*) Tymcom-X was the only PDP-10 operating system (and perhaps the only OS at
the time) that could run a virtual copy of itself on a real copy, for user
mode monitor debugging. Although we never implemented an actual simulated
user address space along with the simulated exec address space, you could
still execute simple programs from the simulated exec space due to the fact
that Tymcom-X UUO calls were reentrant.  This allowed several developers to
work on the monitor without taking any hardware stand alone.

*) Tymcom-X was extremely reliable under heavy user loads.  More often than
not the hardware was the reason for a crash. One system made it up to 1600+
hours (two months) under a heavy user load before it had to be taken down
due to a hardware failure. For the late '70s, this was extraordinary for
PDP-10 systems, at least.

*) We had a state-of-the-art microfiche system for design and maintenance
studies to replace the usual piles of line printer listings usual at the
time. Bill Weiher (WFW) wrote a custom text parsing language that parsed the
monitor LST files and output files in a format to send to the microfiche
vendor. It generated a microfiche coordinate cross reference file so that we
could find the fiche coordinates of any label, instruction, macro, and so
forth. This made it a lot easier to work on the monitor.

*) The large size (for the time) of the file structures for some of our
customer machines prompted the development of SNARL, which could perform an
image dump of the filesystem that ran as fast as the STC tape drives could
run. This reduced the time that our systems had to be down for backup, which
was very important for the timesharing business.

From Joe: I joined Tymshare in 1985, after most of the developers had left.
We ran into a limitation on the maximum size of the file structure;
23 units of 300 MB each (3350 logical units).

<pre>
  256Kw - 16Kw (approx size of the DSKCLN code) = 240 Kwords for bitmaps.
  80 Kw for each of three bitmaps (old, new, error).
  80 Kw * 36 bits/w = 3 million bits = 3 million pages in disk structure.
  1 page = 512 words = 2304 octets.
  3 million * 2304 = 6.9 gigabytes = 23 * 300 megabytes.
</pre>

After doing an ADDPACK for the 24th unit, DSKCLN ran out of memory, and
we ended up doing an ASP restore to return DSKB to 23 units.  At that late
stage of TYMCOM-X, it was decided that the limitation of 23 disk packs
per system was acceptable.
