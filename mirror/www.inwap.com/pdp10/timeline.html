<small>Originally from http://www.digital.com/timeline/</small>
<p>
Here are selected links into the timeline that refer to the PDP-6, PDP-10
and relevant peripherials.
<ul>
<li>1963 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1963-1.html">PDP-6</A>
	being tested.
<li>1964 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1964-1.html">PDP-6
	unveiled</A>, only 26 built.
<li>1964 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1964-2.html">The Monitor</A>,
	which eventually evolved into TOPS-10.  The system programs resided
	on DECtape, leading to sections in the Monitor which checked for
	"Is SYS: rewinding?".
<li>1964 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1964-6.html">DECtapes</A>
	were used on the PDP-6 and PDP-7 for file storage.  The tapes
	had 522 blocks of 128 words each (640 7-bit bytes per block)
	and could only hold 22 file names.
<li>1965 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1965-3.html">Remote Access</A>,
	logging in to a PDP-6 in Massachusetts from Autralia using a TELEX
	terminal (5-bit shift code).
<li>1967 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1967-1.html">PDP-10 debuts.</A>
	The KA-10 was popular with universities, research labs, and commercial
	timsharing bureaus.
<li>1967 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1967-3.html">M series modules</A>
	used integrated circuits instead of individual transistors, and were
	the basis for the KI-10 processor.
<li>1970 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1970-3.html">VT05</A>
	was the predecessor to the VT52.  (It had only 12 lines of text.)
<li>1971 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1971-2.html">DECsystem-10</A>
	is the new name for the PDP-10 computer.  Model 10/40 was diskless,
	Model 10/50 had disks.  [The picture shows a KI-10 Model 10/70 with
	several VT05 (12 lines by 80 columns) terminals.]
<li>1972 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1972-3.html">KI-10 CPU</A>
	was the successor to the KA.  Called a DECsystem-10 Model 10/70.
<li>1974 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1974-3.html">LA36 DECwriter</A>
	terminals replace ASR-33 Teletypes as terminal of choice.  (300 baud.)
<li>1974 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1974-4.html">KL-10 CPU</A>
	introduced, sold as DECsystem-10/80 and DECsystem-10/90.
<li>1975 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1975-5.html">VT52</A> replaced
	the VT05.  (This video terminal had a buzzer instead of a bell.)
<li>1976 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1976-1.html">DECSYSTEM-20</A>
	Model 20/40 was the lowest-priced general-purpose timesharing
	system (cheaper due to lack of cache in the KL-10 CPU).
<li>1976 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1976-2.html">TOPS-20</A>
	was the <b>in</b>direct descendent from TOPS-10. (TOPS-20 was a direct
	descendent from BB&amp;N's TENEX operating system).
<li>1977 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1977-4.html">ARPAnet</A>
	comes to the PDP-10.
<li>1978 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1978-2.html">DECsystem-2020</A>
	introduced as "the world's lowest cost mainframe computer system".<br>
	Can anyone identify the KS-10 developers in <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/photos/decsys2020grp.jpg">the picture?</A>
<li>1978 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/1978-3.html">VT100</A> became
	the industry standard.
<li>1984 <A HREF="http://www.vt100.net/timeline/timeline-82-86.html">36-bit
	architechture begins to fade.</A>.  In May, the 36-bit follow-on
	processor (aka "Jupiter", the KC-10) was cancelled.
</ul>
Notably abscent from the list above are the dates when DEC announced
multiprocessing (master/slave on 10/55 and 10/77), symmetric multiprocessing
(10/88 and 10/99), Model-B backplane, and the clustered file system (TOPS-20).
