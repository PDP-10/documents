I first began hanging out with the people at CIS when I was 
<a href="ken.html">working with Ken Holland</a>, 
who helped CIS build their facilities.
CIS specializes in film-to-tape transfer, editing, and recently
with E-Film has gotten into digital back to film.

In Hollywood, this is known as "Abekas Alley", because there are (or were
at one time) more abekas digital disks here than anywhere else.

I'd better not say too much more, or they will be mad at me for talking too much!
