<h1>Stills from Flight of the Navigator</h1>
These stills show the Navigator Spaceship we created at Omnibus Computer
Graphics in L.A.
(Copyright &copy Disney, 1986)  Note the use of an environment map
to produce the reflective appearance of the spaceship.  
The environment maps used here were pieced together from footage
shot on in the location the ship was to appear in.
Working on this film gave me the idea for developing the environment
scanners described here.

Many other people worked on this film, but Bob Hoffman, Doug MacMillan, 
Jeff Kleiser, Art Durinski, Rick Balabuck, and Harold Buchman stand out in my mind.  
Bob in particular did much of the reflection mapping software.
