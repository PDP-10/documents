Here is an article from Daily Variety's Business Section for Thursday, March 27, 1987
that tells the final story.
It was a sad day.  
The company literally couldn't afford to declare bankruptcy.
People were told on a friday to clear out any personal stuff and not to come back.
<p>
The Digital Film Printers were crated up and sent to a warehouse by Triple-I,
the Cray was sent back to Cray Research, and the Royal Bank of Canada
was informed that it was worth almost nothing without millions of dollars in upgrades.
I heard a rumor (unconfirmed) that ads were placed in newspapers for a 
"Slightly Used Cray XMP ...Cheap".

Here is another article from the Toronto Globe and Mail, with much the same
flavor.
Auctions were held for the remainder of the equipment, including people's desks
with papers still in them.
I bought an Ikonas framebuffer for $50 that had been bought eighteen months
earlier for $35,000.
I still have it today. 
It still works.
