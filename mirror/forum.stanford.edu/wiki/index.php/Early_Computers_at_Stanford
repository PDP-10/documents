<p>In March of 1953 an
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/cpc.html" class='external text' title="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/cpc.html" rel="nofollow">IBM CPC</a>
arrived at the Electronics Lab.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_CPC" class='external text' title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM CPC" rel="nofollow">CPC</a>
was composed of three IBM machines that had been made to work
together: an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_604" class='external text' title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM 604" rel="nofollow">IBM 604</a>
or 605 calculating punch, an accounting machine
(one of the IBM 400-series) and an IBM 941 auxiliary storage unit
which held 16 10-digit signed numbers.
Though marketed by IBM, the CPC was actually a combination developed by Northrop 
Aviation in 1948 for use in flight simulations and for other engineering 
work.  It used mainly relays and some vacuum tubes.
</p><p>Although it provided some storage, the IBM CPC was not a stored-program 
computer in the modern sense.  The mechanical storage was similar to that of an 
<a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/voy/museum/pictures/EAM/IMG_1705.jpg" class='external text' title="http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/voy/museum/pictures/EAM/IMG 1705.jpg" rel="nofollow">IBM 602</a> machine. 
The CPC was programmable at three levels:
</p>
<ol><li> The data paths between storage units in the accounting machine and the auxiliary storage units were determined by wiring.
</li><li> The electronic calculator in the IBM 604 or 605 could be micro-programmed using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-board" class='external text' title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-board" rel="nofollow">plugboard</a> in that unit, and
</li><li> The overall operation of the machine could be programmed using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_card#IBM_80_column_punch_card_format" class='external text' title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch card#IBM 80 column punch card format" rel="nofollow">80-column punch cards</a>, each of which could perform two operations between three pieces of addressed data and store the result in the location specified in the fourth address.  Cards were read at a rate of 100 cards per minute.
</li></ol>
<p>The <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/voy/museum/pictures/display/1-2-IBM-CPC.htm" class='external text' title="http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/voy/museum/pictures/display/1-2-IBM-CPC.htm" rel="nofollow">IBM CPC</a> was normally configured to do floating-point calculations.
</p><p>Roger Moore remembers that this machine still existed at the Electronics Lab in 1961, when he was an undergraduate,
though it was only used by students because the IBM 650 was much faster.
</p><p>There was also an IBM CPC at

</p><p>In addition, Les Earnest used one from 1954 to 1956 in the Navy at the 
Aeronautical Computer lab in suburban Philadelphia, PA.  It was from
this experience that Les contributed much of the description above.

<p>The first stored-program computer at the Electronics Lab was an
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/650.html" class='external text' title="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/650.html" rel="nofollow">IBM 650</a>.
It arrived in January of 1956 and was retired around 1962.
This was a drum computer, meaning
that the program and data resided on a rotating magnetic drum,
rather than in random access memory
(RAM) as used by later computers.  The drum held 2000 10-digit words.
An add instruction required
400 microseconds, and a multiply 10,000.

like the IBM 604, used vacuum tubes.
Later versions of the 
<a href="http://www.piercefuller.com/library/ibm650.html" class='external text' title="http://www.piercefuller.com/library/ibm650.html" rel="nofollow">IBM 650</a>,
but not the machine at Stanford,
had 60 words of core memory.
They were intended to be used as an I/O buffer, but could also be used
for instructions.

starting in June of 1960.
This was a vacuum-tube computer with originally 8,000 44-bit words of core,
each containing 10 decimal digits and a sign digit.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_core_memory" class='external text' title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic core memory" rel="nofollow">Core memory</a> was a new technology, 
replacing drum memory with magnetic cores.
This was called Random-Access Memory (RAM) because you could access any word
of memory in the same time as any other word.
</p><p>Because the sign was implemented as a digit instead of a single bit, a clever
programmer could store extra information in the sign digits, since the add and subtract
instructions used only the low-order bit of the sign digit.
</p><p>Roger Moore remembers that this machine was upgraded from 8,000 to 10,000 words
of core memory around 1960 or 1961.  Roger also remembers the magnificent console
of the B220, which Ted Glaser designed.  It could be considered an ancestor
of the touch-sensitive console.  Each bit was made visible by a small neon bulb.
There was a push switch under the bulb which could be used to invert the state of
the bit.  On the later Burroughs B5000, described below, the lamp and switch were
integrated into a single unit.
</p><p>The add instruction executed in 185 microseconds and multiply
in about 2095.
Roger Moore remembers that Case Institute developed an unapproved hardware 
modification which reduced the time to transfer data from memory to the
D register from eleven cycles to four,
</p><p>The B220 was shared with the First National
Bank of San Jose, which used it for overnight check processing.

To facilitate the preparation of card

keypunches would print an image of each character at the top of the
card, but the IBM 519 did not print, so it was customary to run a
duplicated card deck through the IBM 557, which would print the first 60
columns at the top of each card in its first pass, and optionally print
the remainder of the columns lower on the card on a second pass.
</p><p>The 
<a href="http://www.piercefuller.com/library/ibm407.html" class='external text' title="http://www.piercefuller.com/library/ibm407.html" rel="nofollow">IBM 407</a>
was used to print a program's source code on paper.
John Sauter remembers that the 407 made a strange sound as it was printing: 
it would print two lines in two cycles of the mechanism, and then take a third
cycle in which it would not print.  There was a simple, but forbidden, modification
which would cause the 
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/407.html" class='external text' title="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/407.html" rel="nofollow">IBM 407</a>
to print on every cycle, increasing its speed from
100 lines per minute to 150.  Roger Moore remembers why:
</p><p>In the past, IBM had extended the market life of a mature card machine by renting
a reduced-speed machine.  This was accomplished by changing the pulley size
on the main drive, and was done through the IBM 402.  IBM had already announced
the 2/3-speed 407 when the engineers discovered that the machine didn't work when
the main shaft was slowed down.  As the machine had already been announced,
two extra relays were added which caused the IBM 407 model E8 to print two
cards and then take a dummy cycle.  It did have a distinctive sound because
of this.  The IBM 407 model E8 also had fewer co-selectors, pilot selectors
and adders than the full model.  IBM would charge for service if the relays
were &ldquo;damaged&rdquo;.  There was a gentleman's agreement with the
IBM Customer Engineer that it was OK to remove one of the slow-down relays
for a long job, provided it was re-installed before he noticed its absence.

They could not run the program much because it used so much paper.
</p><p>The IBM 7090 was installed in Pine Hall in late 1962 or early 1963,
and retired in May of 1967.
Roger Moore remembers that from late spring 1962 until its move to Pine Hall,
the IBM 7090 resided at IBM San Jose, where Stanford personnel
were able to use it for eight hours every week day.  In addition, the Subalgol project used
it on weekends.  After its installation in Pine Hall it continued to be used by IBM San Jose.

was added to augment the IBM 1401.
</p><p>A notable improvement in productivity was achieved when Stanford
programmer Don Gold was able to make the IBM 1401 copy simultaneously from
card reader to tape and from tape to printer and card punch.
Previously, the IBM 1401 could copy in only one direction at a time.
</p><p>The IBM 7090 provided general computer service to campus users,
including the Artificial Intelligence project (Lisp and Chess).
Classes were offered in programming the IBM 7090.
The machine ran IBM's Fortran Monitor System, which automatically
loaded the next job from magnetic tape when the previous one finished.
</p><p>In addition to Fortran and the FAP assembler, the IBM 7090 was
programmed in

the Stanford dialect of Balgol,
which was the Burroughs dialect of Algol-58.  Bill McKeeman remembers 
that it was Stanford students Larry Breed and Roger Moore who reimplemented 
Balgol for the IBM 7090, calling the resulting language SUBALGOL.  
The students shared an office in Encina Hall,
two floors above the basement installation of the Burroughs B220.
Larry and Roger went on to work with Ken Iverson, implementing APL
at IBM Research in Yorktown Heights.

was another fully-transistorized, room-size computer, installed in the
room to the right of the IBM 7090 from the point of view of the observer
looking through the glass wall.
</p><p>Bill McKeeman was a full-time employee of the Computation Center (Pine Hall) in 1963.
He was sent to Pasadena with James Watt to learn how to use the B5000.
They worked the night shift for two weeks at the Electrodata plant
while Dave Dahm and Fred Gerbstadt were developing the Burroughs Algol compiler,
which was a variant of Algol 60.  There was a second compiler for the B5000,
called ESPOL, which was a stripped down version of Algol 60 used to write
the Master Control Program (MCP).  We would call the MCP an operating system
today.  The B5000 was transisterized but used no integrated circuits.
So-called cordwood plug-in modules were connected by extensive backplane
wire wrapping.
</p><p>This machine was based on advanced computer concepts for its day,
as contrasted with the IBM 7090, which stressed compatibility with

It was installed before May of 1963,
perhaps in 1962, and retired in 1968.
It was upgraded to a Burroughs B5500, which ran at three times
the speed of the B5000 and offered a second CPU.
Due to software limitations, the second CPU could only execute in user-mode;
an attempt to enter the operating system would
cause it to signal the main CPU for attention.
</p><p>The B5000 had 16,384 48-bit words of memory.
It was programmed in Algol-60 with extensions for I/O and string processing.
Late in its life the B5500 switched off its drum storage
and used disks instead.
</p><p>The Burroughs computer provided general computation service to the campus,
including classes on Algol-60 and validation of Algol programs submitted
for publication as algorithms.
</p><p>John Ehrman remembers that until late 1966 there was 
a dial-up link from SLAC for submitting and retrieving
B5500 jobs.

This was a much smaller-scale computer than the IBM 7090, used for research

Time sharing allowed people at separate consoles to use the PDP-1 
simultaneously, a great increase in productivity.
</p><p>The PDP-1 arrived sometime before May of 1963.
Early in its life it was upgraded from 4,096 18-bit words to 65,536.
When the IBM 7090 acquired its IBM 1301 disk drive,
the PDP-1 was interfaced to it through the 
<a href="http://www.frobenius.com/7090.htm" class='external text' title="http://www.frobenius.com/7090.htm" rel="nofollow">IBM 7631</a> file control.
The PDP-1 was also interfaced directly to the IBM 7090,
and could submit jobs to it using the Bifrost software.
This interface was also used to visualize IBM 7090 data in real time
using the PDP-1's Type 30 CRT display.
See <a href="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/guides/planetccrma/Some.html" class='external autonumber' title="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/guides/planetccrma/Some.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>
for an example.
When the PDP-1 was retired, probably in 1966 or 1967,
its Type 30 display was moved to the DEC PDP-6
at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab.
</p><p>Bill McKeeman and John Sauter remember that the most popular
application on the PDP-1 was 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar_%28video_game%29" class='external text' title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar (video game)" rel="nofollow">Spacewar</a>, 
created by 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Russell" class='external text' title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve Russell" rel="nofollow">Steve Russell</a>
and others.
</p><p>Programming the PDP-1 was generally done using paper tape.
Bill McKeeman remembers that Steve Russell set out wastebaskets
labeled Monday through Sunday, so you had a week to go back
and find a discarded paper tape in case you made a mistake
and needed to back up.
</p><p>In support of its time-sharing mission the PDP-1 was equipped with a
high-speed magnetic drum, which could write 4,096 words of memory onto a
track in one revolution, and simultaneously read 4,096 words from a different
track and write them into those same memory locations.  This was called
&ldquo;<a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/timesharing/timesharing.html" class='external text' title="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/timesharing/timesharing.html" rel="nofollow">swapping</a>&rdquo;.
</p><p>Bill McKeeman wrote a compiler for the PDP-1 called 
<a href="http://hopl.info/showlanguage2.prx?exp=3905" class='external text' title="http://hopl.info/showlanguage2.prx?exp=3905" rel="nofollow">GOGOL</a>.
He first wrote a PDP-1 assembler and emulator on the B5000, 
then wrote the compiler
on punch cards in PDP-1 assembly language.  
When it was &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; he sent it
to the PDP-1's paper tape punch through the IBM 7090
and did the final debugging at the PDP-1's console.
The compiler occupied most of the PDP-1's 4096 words of memory.
When the compiled

program ran it used the compiler
code space for its data.  All error messages were on the
drum and overlaid Gogol when needed, so compilation stopped
with the first error message.  Bill's

</p><p>The PDP-1 also had twelve CRT displays built by Philco, affectionately
called &ldquo;flickos&rdquo;.  These terminals, combined with the drum and
the time-sharing software, made the Stanford PDP-1 the first 
display-oriented
time-sharing system anywhere in the world.  It was used for a number
of years for computer-aided instruction by 
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~psuppes/" class='external text' title="http://www.stanford.edu/~psuppes/" rel="nofollow">Professor Patrick Suppes</a> and his group.

Professor Suppes describes the Stanford PDP-1.
</p><p>John Sauter remembers a regrettable incident in which
a failure in one of the displays caused a loud noise, severely frightening 
the child who was seated at it.  John never learned how this traumatic
experience affected the child's ability to deal with computers
later in his life.

There is some question about whether this machine was a model 65 or model 67,
but John Sauter remembers seeing the lights of the

the dynamic address translation module that is the difference between the

<p>Mark Crispin remembers that there was a PDP-10 at 
the Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences
(IMSSS) in 1977,
using a KI10 processor and running the Tenex operating system.
At some point in the early 1980s, IMSSS acquired a second KI10 processor
from Rutgers and became a dual KI10 system like SUMEX.
Rich Alderson remembers this system still being in place in 1989.
</p><p>Sil Sanders remembers that these machines were in Pine Hall, replacing
the PDP-1.
The first PDP-10 initially ran the TOPS-10 operating system provided by
Digital Equipment Corporation.  
Later a BBN pager was added and the machine ran the 
<a href="http://tenex.opost.com/" class='external text' title="http://tenex.opost.com/" rel="nofollow">Tenex</a> operating system.
When the second PDP-10 processor was added the BBN pager was upgraded and
the Tenex operating system modified to support dual processors.
</p><p>Most of that OS software work was done by Rainer Schultz.  
During that period they also added a Speech Synthesis unit called the MISS 
machine that Gerard Benbassat and Sil Sanders developed and built which was 
used in a computer-based logic 
course for undergraduates by <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~psuppes/" class='external text' title="http://www.stanford.edu/~psuppes/" rel="nofollow">Patrick Suppes</a> and also with some language courses.

was added for swapping.  The Librascope could not be
used for file storage because it was extremely temperature-sensitive.
Les Earnest remembers that a one-degree change in room temperature was enough
to make it start forgetting.  To make it even reliable enough for swapping
required making two copies and checksumming, so it was eventually shut down.

The time-sharing operating system written at SAIL, known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAITS" class='external text' title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAITS" rel="nofollow">WAITS</a>,
was based on the PDP-6 Monitor,

</p><p>Les Earnest remembers that the first and second spelling
checkers for text files were developed at SAIL around 1967 
and 1971.  The first computer-controlled vending machine
anywhere (called The Prancing Pony, from Tolkein's Lord of
the Rings, a source of many place names at SAIL) was
developed around 1972.
</p><p>Beginning in 1971 the SAIL computer facility put bit-mapped
displays on everyone's desk and was apparently the first
facility to do this anywhere in the world.  Those displays
could also show live television either from cameras in the lab
or from broadcast TV.
At about this time Les Earnest developed first social networking

</p><p>Mark Crispin remembers that when he arrived in 1977
there were two processors in the PDP-10 system:
the KA10 described above and a KL10, the fastest
processor in the PDP-10 line.  User jobs were run on the
KL10 and the KA10 ran the XGP font compiler and user jobs
(in &ldquo;spacewar mode&rdquo;, formerly the task of the PDP-6 processor).
</p><p>Les Earnest remembers that the KL10 was a gift from DEC in return for the design concept, 
since it was based on the Super Foonly computer designed by Dave Poole, 
Phil Petit and Jack Holloway 
and was re-engineered by DEC using SUDS, the Stanford University
Drawing System, which was the first interactive electronic 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design" class='external text' title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided design" rel="nofollow">CAD</a>

</p><p>The PDP-6 had by then become a separate computer, though
it booted from the PDP-10.  It operated the

</p><p>Mark Crispin remembers having been told by Les Earnest that the
KA10 was forcibly retired due to a combination of cooling failure
and overtemperature sensor failure.  Mark purchased the remains
as scrap metal from Stanford surplus property and kept some parts
as souvenirs.

<p>When Professor Allan M. Petersen (Kok Chen's advisor) contracted with the National
Science Foundation to develop unmanned satellite-based weather stations for
Antarctica, an additional new HP 2115 was placed in the Sigma 5 room.
Kok Chen remembers that this machine was connected by full-duplex 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_202_modem" class='external text' title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell 202 modem" rel="nofollow">Bell 202 modems</a> on dedicated 4-wire 
land lines to the <a href="http://www.jamesburgdish.org/" class='external text' title="http://www.jamesburgdish.org/" rel="nofollow">Jamesburg satellite dishes</a> in
Carmel Valley, making it possible to control the Antarctic stations from the
Durand basement.
</p><p>Later, the project evolved into the 
<a href="http://amrc.ssec.wisc.edu/aws.html" class='external text' title="http://amrc.ssec.wisc.edu/aws.html" rel="nofollow">Automated Weather Station (AWS)</a> study which used
the Nimbus polar orbiters instead of the Comsat geostationary satellites.
AWS data came on 9-track tapes from Alaska instead of
directly from Jamesburg, but Kok Chen continued to use the HP 2115 to process the data.
After demonstrating its feasibility, the project was handed over to real weather types
in the 
<a href="http://www.wisc.edu/" class='external text' title="http://www.wisc.edu/" rel="nofollow">University of Wisconsin</a>.  Kok Chen tells us that there are
still dozens of AWS
stations in use, including a couple in Greenland.
</p><p>When Kok Chen was doing speech research he used the HP 2115 for its analog-to-digital and 
digital-to-analog interfaces, the Sigma 5 for number crunching, and the Adage to display
the tracking poles and zeros of the human vocal tract.

<p>Mike Gabrielson remembers an Adage GT-30 that was originally acquired by the Industrial
Engineering department and lived in one of their rooms in the 
<a href="http://campus-map.stanford.edu/index.cfm?ID=02-610" class='external text' title="http://campus-map.stanford.edu/index.cfm?ID=02-610" rel="nofollow">610 building</a>.
Around 1974 or 1975 it was moved to Durand 016C.  It was originally in the same room
as the HP 2116 and the Sigma 5, but was eventually walled off into its own room.
</p><p>The Adage was used for only two final &ldquo;official&rdquo; projects: 
a brief Industrial Engineering
research effort into traffic routing mapping funded by Urban Mass Transit Administration
and as the student machine for IE 341 &ldquo;Interactive Computer Graphics&rdquo; in Winter 1975/76,
for which Mike was the teaching assistant.  Not long after that it was scrapped, and was
last seen stored in the water quality labs: the

</p><p>See <a href="http://www.virhistory.com/ncsu/ncsu_lab.htm" class='external autonumber' title="http://www.virhistory.com/ncsu/ncsu lab.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.
</p><p>Mike Gabrielson remembers that Kok Chen modified the Adage to boot from a custom ROM board
instead of from punched paper tape.  The Adage was easy to crash with bad programming,
so Kok Chen's modification made it possible to instantly reboot Stanford's Adage, while
all the other Adages in the world has to chug through three feet or so of tape every time
they restarted.

<p>While Mike Gabrielson was using the Adage, the Industrial Engineering department was offered a

from Southern Pacific, and in turn offered it to Mike's group.
The machine arrived with a gigantic OCR peripheral that Mike estimates to have been
about 250 cubic feet of electronics.  He recalls that Kok Chen pointed out some of the
more rare and expensive components such as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photomultiplier" class='external text' title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photomultiplier" rel="nofollow">photomultiplier tubes</a>, which were extracted
but just ended up stored away in a closet in the IE building.  All the rest was soon
scrapped.
