UNIX offers several kinds hostilities:
    denial of service (type "~/bin" for an example)
    lack of compassion (type "?" into your favorite shell)
    Byzantine failure (type "ld ~/.cshrc" for example)
    corruption of language ("grep this file for...")

.. but then, you knew this already.  So in a more humorous vein, 
I present some tidbits from a local bboard.  Excuse me if you've 
seen this before.

    Note that the '%' prompt indicates that the command should be issued from 
    the C shell, and the '$' prompt indicates the Bourne shell.
