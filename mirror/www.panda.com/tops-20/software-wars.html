This story is intended for adult reading only.  While not "hard core",

None of this is intended to offend.  If this isn't to your tastes, you'd

<B>Acknowledgements</B>
</H3>
<P>
The libel laws prevent me from mentioning by name all those who have
helped me in writing this turkey, but I will mention their contributions
here, so that I don't get stuck with all the blame:
<UL>
<LI>
To the people who brought us <I>STAR WARS</I>, for a movie packed with
outworn clichés, yet dull; filled with symbolic symbolisms
symbolizing symbolic nothings, for providing me with ample source
material.  All kidding aside, <I>STAR WARS</I> is indeed a masterpiece
of science fiction and fantasy.  It is an honor to be able to spoof
it; and more so if my readers have as much fun reading this little
take-off as I had writing it.
<LI>
To the people who made <I>HARDWARE WARS</I>, for starting me off on this
thing in the first place.
<LI>
To everybody here at the lab, for providing me with material to fill
in the gaps in the story.  My apologies to those who might see a bit
of themselves in the story, and yes, my insurance is paid up!
<LI>
To the computer center where I spent my undergraduate years, whose
regressive and repressive policies provided me with ample material for
the policies of the Empire.
<LI>
To the friends who have read and proofread drafts of the story from
time to time, for helping in some quality control.
<LI>
And finally, to a good friend, who was hooked from the beginning; who
continually encouraged me as we saw the story evolve and take a form of
its own; who showed me worlds of science fiction that I didn't know
existed before; and who provided me with material which eventually
determined the shape and body of this story.  Thanks.
</UL>
<P>
Now that that's all taken care of, on with the story...

<H3 ALIGN="center">
<B>Introduction</B>
</H3>
<P>
Once upon a time, sort of long ago, well, uh, you know what I mean, it
wasn't really <I>long</I> long ago but it wasn't like yesterday, I mean,
when you say long ago to some people they think like oodles and oodles
of eons ago and other people think it was last night or something, but
this is sort of in the middle long ago oh forget it.  Anyway, long ago
and far away, well, not like so far away you can't imagine it I mean
you could probably get to it if you had a fast enough starship and
lived long enough but it wasn't near like next door or on this planet
or solar system or even in this galaxy, like that is <I>near</I> and this
was far away like another universe oh hell forget it.
<P>
Long ago and far away, the data processing galaxy was ruled by the
sinister forces of the PASCAL Empire.  Years ago, it had been the
Hacking Republic, where all programming languages and programmers
lived together in peace and harmony.  The land of the Republic was
patrolled by the Wizards, skilled in all forms of magic, who daily
unveiled new miracles for the wonder of the citizens of the Republic.
They drew their mystical powers from <I>The Hack</I>, which was their
succor in any difficulty.
<P>
But the days of the Republic were numbered, for one of the Wizards,
Daemon Feature, fell in with the PASCALs, who brought in crocks and
bletcherousness to the beleaguered Republic.  Using methods both
sinister and cunning, he managed to entrap most of the loyal Wizards
in a fencepost error, where they were ruthlessly slaughtered.  At last
the Republic was proclaimed to have ended, and the Empire was
established with Recordstructure, the leader of the PASCALs,
proclaimed Emperor.  The old Republic's Senate was reduced to a mere
rubber stamp for the Emperor.  And the lot of programmers was unhappy.
<P>
As our story begins, civil war has broken out.  Rebel hackers,
striking out from a hidden data base, have won a surprise victory
against the Empire.  In the course of the battle, rebel spies seized
copies of the Empire's design of the TENTH STAR, their new processor
and operating system.  Horrified, they transmitted the plans to
Princess Lay-me, to be given to her father, so that the design of the
new machine could be analysed before it became operational.  If the
rebels fail to design a winning monitor for it in time, its lossage
will spread throughout the universe.  Fear would keep the more timid
administrators in line; and that would be the end of all programming
winnage.
<P>
Now, a small ship, bearing Princess Lay-me and two snoids, is speeding
through space, an Empire destroyer hot in pursuit and gaining...
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
<B>The Princess pleads for help</B>
</H3>
<P>
The <I>Big Nastie</I>, a feared vessel of the Empire's fleet, had now
approached within tractor range of the tiny ship.  Already, it was
entangling the smaller vessel in its inescapable web of circular data
structures.  Princess Lay-me acted quickly.
<P>
"Hey, snoid," she snarled at U-2-buckeroo, a video switched snoid,
"get ready to record a message for me."  At that, the snoid made a few
clicking sounds as it mounted a spare cassette and started running.
<P>
"<I>NOT NOW!!</I>" Lay-me shrieked.  "Wait until I get my negligee on.
How the fuck do you expect me to seduce some poor young kid into doing
all sorts of idiotic things for our cause wearing <I>this</I>?  Oh shit,
my hair is messed up too.  Fuck it, I'll just change and run a brush
through it a couple of minutes."  She was thus engaged as her craft
was slowly being dragged back with greater and greater recursion.
Soon its stack would overflow and all would be lost.
<P>
"Okay, pretty shitty but it'll hafta do," she told the waiting snoid.
Then, lying back so as to emphasize her well-endowed cleavage as much
as possible, she began.
<P>
"Heeeelp meee," she purred.  U-2-buckeroo clicked in surprise at the
sudden, but pleasant, change in her voice.  "Oh heeeelp me Moby
Foobar.  It's just pooor li'l ol' me all alone in the big bad world."
A tear appeared in her eye and slowly rolled down one cheek.  "I just
<I>have</I> to get these papers to my daddy at Automagic or who knows
what will become of me."  She started sobbing uncontrollably, and
gestured to the snoid to stop the recording.  Instantly she
straightened up.
<P>
"You got that right?" she growled.  Another click.  "If you screwed
this up I'll pull yar plug and sell ya for scrap metal."  The snoid
beeped in fear as it hurried to assure her no mistakes were made.  She
glared at it with a look that would melt titanium, then relaxed.
<P>
"Okay, I believe you.  Now take these papers and lock them in core.  I
don't want nobody getting swapped in until it's finished."  The snoid
beeped acknowledgement and departed.  Just in time, for at the next
instant in rushed the soldiery of the Empire: CS profs, grad students,
and not a few bureaucrats were among them.  They howled with glee at
the sight of the seductively clad Princess.  They were about to
perform all sorts of foul deeds upon her body when the ship's intercom
rang out with a feared voice.
<P>
"The Princess is not to be molested," said the voice of Daemon
Feature.  "She is to be brought to me for interogation immediately."
The boarding party froze, and, grumbling, retreated, leaving an
untouched, but disappointed, princess.
<P>
"Oh <I>shit</I>!" she sighed.  Daemon Feature was absolutely hopeless.
<P>
<UL>
<<<I>What will happen to the Princess?  What does Daemon Feature want
with her?  What reader is so naive that he can't figure it out
himself?  Read on!</I>>>
</UL>
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
<B>Snoids are more fun than duckies!</B>
</H3>
<P>
U-2-buckeroo rolled down the corridor, heedless of the loud commotion
in the control room.  The Empire would not think of intercepting a
snoid, at least not until too late.  But U-2-buckeroo didn't have much
time; the B-movie heavies may be dumb, but they would figure it out
soon enough, too soon if it wasted much time.
<P>
"Oh!  There you are thweetie!"  It was the voice of C-me-poo-poo, the
ship's interior decoration snoid.  "Where <I>have</I> you been?  I wath
tho worried!  Oh dear, oh my, they are going to dithcharge our power
packth, I juth <I>know</I> it.  Oh what thall we do oh what thall we do?"
As C-me-poo-poo spoke, its wrist joint wagged in frantic semaphore.
"What were you doing with the Princeth all that time alone, letting me
juth worry mythelf <I>thilly</I> over you?"  U-2-buckeroo just rolled by,
ignoring the ridiculous snoid.
<P>
"Juth where are you going?" C-me-poo-poo demanded.  "Thomtimeth you
are juth impothible to talk to.  Now come back here."  U-2-buckeroo
just rolled on, now heading away from C-me-poo-poo.  "Well, I know
when I've been thnubbed.  It'th all over between uth."  U-2-buckeroo
continued on, and turned into an airlock.  C-me-poo-poo stood there
for a second, then dashed into the airlock just before the I-level
timeout.
<P>
And KERZOOM!  They were both whisked away in a single packet (with the
priority bit set) through the network and onto a seemingly desert
host.  They were on a bleak, windswept plateau overlooking a searing
desert.  There was no sign of life; not that there would be in the
endlessly shifting sands below.  C-me-poo-poo was still babbling
endlessly, giving U-2-buckeroo "one last chance" to "save our
relationship."
<P>
U-2-buckeroo started down into the valley.  C-me-poo-poo was still
babbling away in despair and finally blew a circuit breaker.
U-2-buckeroo had now reached the valley and was now cutting straight
through the valley towards the outskirts on the other side, where its
eventual destination lay.
<P>
It was perilous for U-2-buckeroo to take this route, but it needed
speed, and could not afford the time it would take to go around the
long way.  The valley, which had looked desolate from the heights,
actually was filled with mechanical activity of the lowest sort.  Here
were the ripoffs of the galaxy.  Not a few IBM 370s were there,
warring over their individual territories.  U-2-buckeroo's hope was to
get through this jungle unnoticed.
<P>
"Wanna date?" asked a cute little System/3 which had boldly walked up
to it.  U-2-buckeroo beeped a "No thanks", and instantly the failsafe
systems started passing the message to the system console:
MALFUNCTIONING SNOID.  U-2-buckeroo had no time to feep an objection
before it was powered down and moved to the shop for examination.  In
its last voltage-starved cycles, it wondered how much longer the
author was going to get away with this sort of garbage.  It wasn't the
only one!
<P>
<UL>
<<<I>Are things ever in a mess now!  The princess is a prisoner of
Daemon Feature, the snoids are turned off.  Is there any hope?  Does
anybody care?  Read on!</I>>>

<B>Back on the farm...</B>
</H3>
<P>
Fluke Softwarespecialist sighed with relief as he made the final pass
over the card decks for the day.  Then he looked at the horizon; it
was fiery red, but elsewhere night was already setting in.  He set his
vessel's autopilot for home, and relaxed.
<P>
He had been living here with his aunt and uncle ever since his parents
died when he was a young child.  He had been told that they had been
killed when their crippled vessel burned up upon reentry to their home
planet.  He had never heard any other account, and his father had been
given full honors by the Empire, but he had heard dark stories that
all was not as it had seemed.
<P>
But when he had brought it up to his aunt and uncle, they only
repeated to him what he had already been told.  If the truth was any
different, it had been well concealed.
<P>
Not that he had any reason to suspect them; they had been like parents
to him and he had always been treated with kindness.  His uncle had
lived here since before Fluke was born, and over the years had
established a prosperous, if unpretentious, business, supplying COBOL
utilities for many of the settlements in this quadrant of the galaxy.
Fluke loved them dearly, but he was restless, and did not want to
follow in his uncle's footsteps; he yearned for adventure and
excitement.
<P>
He joined his uncle, who was busy with a group of snoiders, the
cloaked traders in abandoned junk snoids who wandered around the area.
Good, Fluke thought, he's getting some more snoids.  Perhaps with the
new snoids he would be able to leave these card punches forever.  His
uncle had decided upon two abandoned snoids which had been found
wandering on the planet; a buckeroo and a poo-poo.  Not really what
was needed; but the price was right and perhaps they could be
reprogrammed.
<P>
His uncle paid for the snoids and they all went inside.  Fluke started
cleaning and repairing them (being careful about the poo-poo lest it
get ideas) while his aunt and uncle prepared lunch.  It was while he
was cleaning the buckeroo that it suddenly activated a cassette, and a
wraith-like figure appeared.  It gradually formed the shape of a
woman.
<P>
"Heeeelp meee," purred the recording.  "Oh heeeelp me Moby Foobar."
Then came a gritch and the recording repeated from that point.
Clearly there was more to the recording, but it was read-locked, and
it was only chance that that fragment had become unprotected, probably
as a result of the damage the buckeroo has recently sustained.  But
who was Moby Foobar?  At the far end of the valley lived Fred Foobar,
an old hermit whom everybody thought was crazy.  But perhaps he was
some relative?
<P>
Fluke reset the buckeroo and ordered it to play the entire recording.
Instead, it re-read-locked the entire tape and the image disappeared,
but not from Fluke's mind.
<P>
Later, at lunch, he talked about it with his uncle.
<P>
"While I was cleaning the buckeroo, I got a segment of an old message,
addressed to a Moby Foobar.  He seemed to own the snoid.  Anyway, it
seemed to be very important that he got that message."
<P>
"I doubt very much if Moby Foobar will ever want to get that message,"
said Fluke's uncle.  "He has been dead for many years now."
<P>
"But this was a recent message, and the read-lock was still on.  How
could such an old message have survived?  And could old Fred Foobar be
related?"
<P>
"Fred Foobar is just a crazy old man.  Tomorrow, I want you to go and
do a complete purge on the buckeroo.  That should end this message
business."
<P>
"All right.  By the way, now that we have these new snoids, when can I
split?  You have all the help you need now."
<P>
"Now is when I need you the most.  Wait just one more year, when I can
hire some more workers, get a few more snoids, and then you can go."
<P>
"<I>Another year?!</I> That isn't fair!  All my friends have left a long
time ago and I'm still cooped here."
<P>
"I know, but I have no choice.  I promise this time."
<P>
"Oh shit.  Well, I better get back to those snoids."  Fluke left the
table and stormed out.  His aunt watched him for a minute then turned
to her husband.
<P>
"You know, we can't keep him forever.  He's just not destined for
COBOL.  There's too much of his father in him."
<P>
"Yes, that's what I'm worried about.  For him.  I'm afraid he'll get
involved in hacking like his father did."
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
<B>Fluke meets Foobar</B>
</H3>
<P>
Fluke walked into the shop and looked around.  Neither snoid was in
sight.  Fluke walked around to the other side of a cabinet, and
cringing behind it was C-me-poo-poo, shivering with terror.
<P>
"What are you doing back there?" Fluke demanded.
<P>
"Oh, thweetie, pleathe don't dithconnect me!" pleaded the snoid.
Fluke rolled his eyes heavenward.  <I>Give me strength.</I>  "It'th all
U-2'th fault.  I <I>told</I> him not to go."
<P>
"Oh <I>shit</I>!"  Fluke grabbed his magnifying glass and dashed outside.
He looked around in all directions, but no trace of the buckeroo.
"That little snoid is gonna cost me a lot of trouble."
<P>
"Oh, he <I>exthellth</I> in that.  Are we going to follow him?"
<P>
"Can't now," Fluke answered.  "Too many users out now.  We'll have to
wait until dark."  With that, Fluke and the snoid went inside.
<P>
Night fell, and Fluke slipped outside, careful not to disturb his aunt
and uncle.  He had managed to cover up the disappearance of the
buckeroo up to now, but now he had to find it, and soon.  Accompanied
by C-me-poo-poo, he hopped on the transporter, and soon they were
speeding across the desert waste.  Presently, Fluke saw a snoid on his
radar beacon, and headed towards it.  Sure enough, it was the
buckeroo.  Fluke hopped out of the transporter.
<P>
"Where d'ya think you're going?" Fluke asked the buckeroo, which only
continued its endless, incessant feeping.  Again Fluke rolled his eyes
heavenward and wondered how his uncle ever got suckered into buying
two snoids that anyone else would pay to get rid of.  C-me-poo-poo
translated.
<P>
"He says there are life forms approaching from the north-west."
<P>
"Users!" gasped Fluke.  "Well, come on, let's get a look."  Fluke,
followed by C-me-poo-poo, climbed the ridge to the northwest and
looked down.  He could see endless rows of consoles, all running WHO
and RSL, but no users.  Then with horror, he noticed that one was
running VERIFY.  <I>Luckhams!</I> These were the most feared tribe of
users, cunning and cruel.  Fluke shuddered, and was about to slip
back, when...
<P>
"<I>People who are not contributing to the support of the lab are
taking up too much of the machine!  The scheduler is not giving us our
fair share!  If you do not bring the system up immediately heads will
roll!</I>" Fluke cringed at each blow.  The Luckhams had caught him, and
were after blood.  "<I>We are the only people doing real AI research!
We pay most of the lab's support!  The S-1 and music groups are using
too much of the machine!  We should have exclusive immunity from
autologout!</I>" Fluke mercifully lost consciousness, the hideous blows
still coming down.
<P>
When he came to, a cloaked and hooded figure was stooping over him.
Embroidered on the cloak was <I>Deux ex machina hermitage</I>.  The
toothy, slobbering face had a familiar look.
<P>
"Fred Foobar!" gasped Fluke.  "Am I glad to see you!"
<P>
"The terminal rooms are not to be travelled lightly, young Fluke,"
said Fred.  "You've had a busy day.  Come!  We'll have to get indoors
quickly.  The users are easily cowed, but they will soon return, with
greater lossage.  Luckhams especially; they are never appeased."
Fluke got up quickly, remembering the attack, and marveling that he
was still in one piece, but even more that the reader is still reading
this drivel.  He looked at the large thick part still in the reader's
right hand, and sighed.  Still a lot more to go.
<P>
U-2-buckeroo had been hiding under a ledge since the attack, and now
joined them, but C-me-poo-poo had tripped over his own lisp and was
lying there helpless.  After lifting the giggling snoid up and
bundling it into the transporter, the party quickly sought the safety
of Fred Foobar's hermitage.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
<B>The House of Foobar</B>
</H3>
<P>
"Tell me, Fluke," said Fred, "what brings you to such a remote
installation?"
<P>
"I'm trying to get faster real-time response with this buckeroo.  It
says it has to find Moby Foobar, and slipped away earlier today to
find him.  I have never seen such devotion in a snoid before.  Have
you heard of Moby Foobar?"
<P>
"<I>Moby Foobar, Moby Foobar</I>," sighed Fred.  His eyes glazed over as
if remembering days long gone by.  The 'ludes were having their
effect.  "Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long, long time,
since before you were born."
<P>
"Then you knew him?  My uncle said he was dead."
<P>
"Oh, he's not dead, not yet.  He's me.  In fact, I knew your father back in the
old days, before the Empire."
<P>
"You knew my father??"
<P>
"Yes.  He was a skilled hacker, a resourceful wizard," sighed Moby,
"and a good friend.  He was killed in the early days of the Empire."
<P>
"Tell me, how did my father die?  I was told..."
<P>
"You were told a lie!" interrupted Moby.  "Long ago, in the last days
of the Republic, a young wizard named Daemon Feature (who was my
student before he turned to evil) aided the PASCALs in the ruin of the
Republic.  Feature <I>betrayed</I>, and <I>murdered</I> your father."  He
spoke those words with such emphasis that Fluke shook.  But his words
were true; Fluke could see it.
<P>
Moby sighed.  "Feature was seduced by the darker side of the Hack.
Today, the wizards are all but extinct."  He paused, searching his
memory, back to a time long ago.  "Which reminds me.  Your father left
me something to give to you."  He reached into the piles of paper and
old, dusty manuals on the table, and withdrew a single binder.  "His
HAKMEM.  An elegant programming tool, of a more civilized age.  With
it, one skilled in the Hack could perform programming miracles, get
better response time, and be invited to all the good parties.
Here."  He handed the HAKMEM to Fluke.
<P>
Fluke took it, and looked at its first page intently; strange it
seemed, yet a feeling grew on him, as if he were looking at something
far greater than he could comprehend.  He was considered a good
programmer, one of the best in the quadrant; but the HAKMEM took his
breath away.  "What is the Hack?" he asked finally.
<P>
"The Hack is that what is nearest and dearest to the hearts of all the
wizards.  It is what gives the wizard his power.  The Hack is
everywhere and is part of everything.  Without the Hack, only crocks
remain."
<P>
"The Hack!" gasped Fluke.  He then pondered these words in silence.  A
whole new vision was before him; he saw things of beauty and elegance
that he could not yet put into words.  His reverie was interrupted by
a sudden chirping from U-2-buckeroo.
<P>
"Ah, yes, the message," said Moby.  "Come, let's hear it."  The
buckeroo gave one last chirp, then the princess appeared.  This time,
the whole message was played.  Moby sat back.
<P>
"Well," he sighed, "I must be off to Automagic.  And you must come
with me, and learn the ways of the Hack."
<P>
"But I can't!" protested Fluke.  "My aunt and my uncle need me!  I
mean, I hate the Empire, but I can't do anything.  I'd like to go, but
it's so far away.  It's late, I have to get back.  Aww, I'll give you
a ride to the DECUS conference.  You should be able to find a way to
Automagic from there."
<P>
"Do what you think is right," replied Moby.  Fluke looked at him,
wavering.  Already the Hack was entering his thoughts; but he was
still afraid.  He still was thinking over all Moby had told him, as
the transporter, carrying Fluke, Moby, and the two snoids, was
speeding along the paths to DECUS...
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
<B>The Road to DECUS</B>
</H3>
<P>
Fluke slowed down the transporter.  Ahead, he could see the ruins of a
snoider's trailer, and smaller brown objects around it.  When they
reached it, they stopped and looked around.  The brown objects were
bodies, brutally pie-sliced.
<P>
"Users!" exclaimed Fluke.  "I have never seen them attack so
viciously.  Look!  Here is a jump out of a DO, and another back in.
But what would they want with snoiders?"
<P>
"Not users," corrected Moby, "but the Empire wants you to believe it
was users.  See the accuracy of the pie-slice?  Only Empire software
tools can be so deadly."
<P>
"The Empire?  But why?"  But Fluke's glance almost instinctively
turned to U-2-buckeroo, chirping faster than usual.
<P>
"You are looking at the reason," answered Moby Foobar.  Fluke gasped
with horror.
<P>
"If they traced the snoids here, then they know where...<I>NO!!</I>"  Fluke
dashed to the transporter, and headed to his home, ignoring Moby's cries
to come back.
<P>
Fluke approached the familiar fields.  Smoke was rising in the
distance.  He hurried towards it.  His home was destroyed.  The greedy
flames were still licking at the ashes which remained.  And by what
was the entrance, Fluke gazed with horror at the charred and grizzled
corpses of his aunt and uncle.
<P>
A tear appeared in his eye.  He brushed it away.  Gradually, his
horror turned to hatred; hatred of the Empire and all that it stood
for.  And at the same time, he wanted to go with Moby Foobar.  The
fear was gone; the Hack had won.  Fluke jumped back into the
transporter, and hurried back to Moby Foobar.
<P>
Moby had not been idle.  He, assisted by the two snoids, had
constructed a makeshift pyre and had almost finished the ghastly task
of cremating the snoiders.  As he completed this duty, he looked at
Fluke, who was standing there.
<P>
"There was nothing you could do.  Had you been there, you would have
been killed too."
<P>
"Moby, I want to go with you to Automagic.  I want to learn about the
Hack and become a wizard like my father.  There is nothing for me here
now."
<P>
Moby smiled.  He said nothing, but simply entered the transporter.
Fluke and the snoids followed, soon they were again on their way.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
<B>DECUS</B>
</H3>
<P>
The transporter slowed, and then stopped.  They were at the edge of a
high shelf, overlooking DECUS.  Fluke and Moby got out and looked down
on the city.
<P>
"The DECUS conference," observed Moby.  "Fluke, you would have to
telnet far to find such a wretched assortment of losers and villainy.
We must be careful."  Fluke nodded in agreement.  They got back in the
transporter, and soon were at DECUS.  Moby was right; chieftains of
all the commercial timesharing houses were there, voicing demands
for more usage accounting.  Fluke shuddered.
<P>
They had not gone far on their way when they were challenged by an
Empire soldier.  Others appeared, and quickly they were surrounded.
<P>
"How long have you had these snoids?" the soldier demanded of Fluke.
<P>
"Two or three releases," answered Fluke; not that there was much hope
in fooling them.  <I>It's all over now,</I> he thought, <I>no hope of
escape.</I>  His thoughts were interrupted by Moby's voice.
<P>
"<I>The right half of a POPJ can be used to store data,</I>" he intoned.
The soldier's eyes opened wide.  Moby continued.  "These are not the
snoids you are looking for."
<P>
"These are not the snoids we are looking for," repeated the soldier,
as if in a trace.
<P>
"We can go about our business."
<P>
"They can go about their business."
<P>
"We should move on."
<P>
"Move on," said the soldier, waving them away.  The others dispersed.
<P>
"How did you do that?" Fluke asked once they were out of hearing.  "I
thought we were dead back there!"
<P>
"The Hack has many powers, and over weak minds such as theirs it is
easy to take command."  Fluke looked at him in admiration.  Someday he
would be like Moby.
<P>
They stopped outside a seedy-looking establishment.  There was no sign
of life outside, but the building itself was shaking.  Even from
outside Fluke could hear the sounds within.  <I>You can tell by the way
I frob my crock, my randomness is hard to grok,</I> blared the familiar
music from <I>Monday Morning Headache</I>.
<P>
"Are you sure we'll find a consultant here?" asked Fluke doubtfully.
<P>
"Oh yes, of course," answered Moby.  "All the best ones can be found
here."  He paused at the doorstep.  "By the way, be careful.  This place
can get a bit rough."  At that, he entered, with Fluke and the snoids
following.  Instantly they were engulfed with the sound.  <I>Ah, ah, ah,
ah, stayin' online, stayin' online...</I>  A dark apparition loomed in front
of them.  It allowed Moby to pass, but it stopped Fluke and the two
snoids.  A light appeared.
<P>
"Let's see your ID," it demanded.  Fluke produced his and the figure
held it to the light.  Satisfied, it returned it to Fluke, and then
demanded the same of the snoids.  "You can't come in," it snarled at
them.  The snoids stood there, frozen.  Fluke intervened.
<P>
"You better wait outside," he addressed the snoids.  "We don't want
any trouble."  At that, the snoids turned around and exited.  Fluke
then went over to Moby, who was already in conversation with a tall,
wraith-like figure.  It was covered with hair (and fleas).  Fluke
could see no face.  <I>A hippie</I>, Fluke thought.  <I>I hope Moby knows
what he's doing.  I sure as hell don't.</I>  Suddenly Fluke was roughly
pushed aside.
<P>
"Get outta my way, punk," snarled a hideous figure.  It wore a black
leather jacket, and carried a chain in one hand and a blackjack in the
other.  Not satisfied with merely pushing Fluke, it aimed a vicious
blow at him with its blackjack.
<P>
The blow never fell.  Swifter than lightning, Moby had his HAKMEM out
and dispatched the biker with a single item.  Moby looked around at
the crowd, which quickly turned away.  Not only didn't they want to
challenge Moby, they didn't even want to know what had happened.  Moby
left the mess for the after-hours crew to clean up, and helped Fluke
up.
<P>
"I have been talking to the first mate of a suitable ship to bring us
to Automagic.  The captain is supposed to be one of the best
consultants in this quadrant.  Let us join them," Moby said,
indicating a table where the hippie was sitting.  Sitting next to him
was a tall, self-confident man some years older than Fluke.  He fit in
with the place quite well; his color-coordinated John Travolta outfit
mirrored the smoke-filled atmosphere.  He appeared to be staring
vacantly into the distance, planning the conquest of one of the many
wenches who frequented the place, but a closer examination showed it
was not so.  He was asleep.
<P>
The hippie nudged him awake.  After a few groans he introduced himself
as Handwave Saga and the hippie as Cruftybraindamaged.  Moby quickly
stated their business: passage to Automagic for Fluke, Moby, and two
snoids, with no questions asked.  Handwave and Crufty smiled knowingly
at each other.  <I>Amateurs, stashing the shit in the snoids.</I>  They
accepted the deal immediately.  Anyone that dumb deserved to get ripped
off.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
<B>Aboard the TENTH STAR</B>
</H3>
<P>
"So," snarled Daemon Feature, breathing heavily, "you vill not talk?
Ve hav VAYS of making you talk!"  Princess Lay-me cowered.  Daemon had
interrogated her for several days now.  Not once, however, had he
beaten her or taken advantage of her.  <I>This is cruel and inhuman
torture,</I> she thought.  <I>How does he do it?</I> She was getting
desperate.  The guard snoids were no help; Daemon Feature had
sinisterly selected all neuters.
<P>
She knew, though, that her silence was the only thing keeping her
alive.  Should she yield to the torture, or the location of the rebel
data base be found out in spite of her silence, she would be killed
instantly.
<P>
Daemon Feature signaled to an injector snoid.  <I>Truth serum</I>, she
thought.  Terror-striken, she watched as the needle injected the
powerful aphrodisiac into her veins...
<P>
The council was already in session when Daemon Feature entered.
Governor Softwarerot was addressing those present:
<P>
"The Senate is of no concern to us; the Emperor has dissolved the
council.  All responsibility rests with us now."
<P>
"Oh goodie!" said Admiral Whatshisface, commander of the TENTH STAR.
"Let's go stomp them hackers!"
<P>
"Do not put too much faith in this hairy architecture you have
constructed," retorted Daemon Feature.  "All this is insignificant
compared to the Hack."
<P>
"Aw, don't hassle us with your hokey Hack stuff.  All anybody has to
do is take a few CS courses and he can program as well or better than any
of those hackers."  Daemon Feature glared at him in rising wrath.
Suddenly Whatshisface found it difficult to breathe.  The others
watched horrified.
<P>
"<I>Control-Meta-Top-BREAK!</I> I find your lack of faith disturbing!"
snarled Daemon Feature.  Whatshisface's face changed from vivid red to
purple, as the circular linked lists closed tighter.
<P>
"Feature, release him!" shouted Softwarerot.
<P>
"As you wish," replied Daemon Feature.  Whatshisface dropped to the
table as he slowly recovered.
<P>
"Now there is to be no more of this!" continued Softwarerot.  "Lord
Feature will continue the debugging.  Feature, have you been
successful in your interrogation of the princess yet?"
<P>
"Unfortunately not.  She has encrypted her file system.  However, I
expect to break her soon."
<P>
"That may not be necessary," replied Softwarerot, "I have an idea..."
<P>
"Governor Softwarerot," observed the princess.  "I should have known
you would be holding Daemon Feature's leash.  I thought I noticed your
foul stench when I was first brought on board."
<P>
"Flattery will get you nowhere," returned Softwarerot.  Motioning to a
viewscreen, he observed, "Automagic.  Your home planet.  Watch."  The
princess looked on with horror as a 99 million year lease and
maintenance contract for a network of TENTH STARs was being prepared
for Automagic.
<P>
"No!" she gasped.  "Automagic has no need for it.  Our computing
resources are more than ample for the demand."
<P>
"Would you prefer another target, a hacking target?" returned
Softwarerot.  "Then <I>tell us the location of the rebel data base!</I>"
<P>
The princess sobbed, then blurted out, "On [XY,ZZY]."  Softwarerot
smiled.
<P>
"You see, Feature, she can be convinced."  Then, to the lawyers, "You
may sign when ready."
<P>
"WHAT?!" screamed the princess.
<P>
"You are too trusting," smiled Softwarerot, as her innocent planet got
permanently entangled in hopeless lossage.  His smile faded as a
LOOKUP on [XY,ZZY] showed that the data base <I>had</I> been there, but
had since been backed up elsewhere.
<P>
"Double the Robert Redford movies, and don't stop until she talks!"
he ordered.  The princess begged for mercy.  "Take her away!"
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
<B>Automagic</B>
</H3>
<P>
It had been a weary journey, but the end was near at last.  Fluke
listened intently to Moby throughout most of the journey as he
lectured on the ways of the Hack.  Fortunately, Moby frequently passed
out, so the ordeal was never prolonged.  Other times, Fluke stared at his
HAKMEM, seeking to become one with the Hack.  He ignored the hippie's
occasional requests for "just a little fix."  <I>I wonder what he's
talking about,</I> thought Fluke.
<P>
Suddenly Moby jumped up, then slowly sat down again, his face
contorted in agony.
<P>
"Have you sensed a disturbance in the Hack, as if millions of innocent
people were suddenly subjected to horrible cretinism?"  inquired
Fluke.
<P>
"Uh, no, just a hangover," reassured Moby.  He went back into his
stupor and Fluke returned to his study of his HAKMEM.  Presently
Handwave turned on the <I>Fasten Seat Belts</I> sign.  They were now in
the vicinity of Automagic.  Handwave switched the line protocol, and
<I>THWACK!</I> instantly they were hit with a repeated series of parity
errors.
<P>
"What the hell?"  exclaimed Handwave.  The tiny craft was being
buffeted with increasing lossage.  "This isn't in the manual.
Automagic was supposed to be winning."
<P>
"Are we at Automagic yet?" asked Fluke.
<P>
"That's what I'm trying to tell you kid," answered Handwave.
"Automagic has become a loser.  It's running with longer turnaround
times, greater swapping, more stoppages, and..."  He stopped suddenly.
A distant object had appeared on the view screen, and was rapidly
growing.  Now they were clearly heading straight towards it.
<P>
"Turn the ship around," commanded Moby.  "It's a mainframe."
<P>
"Huh?  It's just a microprocessor," replied Handwave, "nothing to...
Uh oh, I think you're right.  Crufty, let's <I>get the fuck outta here!</I>"
This last was screamed as the sheer size of the installation became
apparent.  It was from there that all the parity errors were coming
from.
<P>
Too late.  Already their card deck was in the reader, and the operator
refused to give it back.  They were being forced into the system.
<P>
"Crufty, full rewind!" yelled Handwave.  But there was nothing the
hippie or anyone else could do.  Already they were being compiled.
Soon would come the linking-load, and then the execution...
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
<B>The Rescue</B>
</H3>
<P>
Fluke and his friends peered cautiously out of the concealed pages where
they had been hiding.  The initial sweep by the Empire's evil soldiery had
failed to locate them, but they couldn't hide there forever.  It wouldn't
be long before a kernel mode process was used and they would be caught.
<P>
They snuck out onto a low-baud data line.  That way they stood the best
chance of getting to a console undetected.  In spite of all the safeguards
they managed to guess a correct password and soon were online.  Moby
mumbled something about greater bandwidth and slipped away, telling the
others to stay where they were until he had flushed the job streams so
that they could escape.  U-2-buckeroo started a WHO and instantly began
beeping furiously.
<P>
"What's it saying?" asked Fluke to C-me-poo-poo.
<P>
"I don't understand.  Something like <I>I found her</I>...oh I see now.  It's
<I>I found the princess!</I>"
<P>
"<I>The princess!</I>" gasped Fluke.  "Where?"
<P>
"In low core, right above free storage," replied the snoid.  "I'm afraid
she's about to be swapped out."
<P>
"<I>Swapped out!</I>" screamed Fluke.  "We have to go and rescue her!"
<P>
"Hey wait a minute," retorted Handwave.  "I didn't sign up for no rescues.
I'm stayin' right here."
<P>
"She has service level," replied Fluke.  "She can have your allocation
increased to more than you can imagine."
<P>
"Really?" asked Handwave skeptically.
<P>
"Really.  She makes the assignments."
<P>
"Hmm..." mused Handwave.  "You better be right on this, kid."
<P>
"I am.  Believe me."
<P>
"Okay.  So how are we gonna rescue her?"
<P>
"First, let's lock Crufty in core."  Fluke walked over to the hippie, but
the stench instantly drove him back.  Turning to Handwave, he continued,
"Uh, you do it."  Handwave performed the UUO undeterred.  <I>I guess he
doesn't notice,</I> thought Fluke.  "Now, let's set up an interrupt for the
next clock tick and process it with PI's off."
<P>
It was tricky, but eventually it was done.  They had to hurry, though,
since soon the users would notice the service interruption and reload.
Fluke shuddered at the memory of his near-fatal encounter the previous
day.  Several jobs had already been locked out of core, so they knew that
trouble was on the way.
<P>
Fluke mapped in the page where the princess was being kept and entered.
She was asleep on a crude cot, worn out after the harsh torture she had
undergone.  She shivered and suddenly awoke.  At the sight of Fluke her
eyes popped open.  She rubbed them once and looked again.  It was not a
dream; Fluke was really there.  She sat up and spoke.
<P>
"Well, it's about time.  Come over here."  Fluke stood there, still
enthralled with her beauty (there weren't many women down at the farm).
"<I>Come here,</I>" she repeated, somewhat louder.  Fluke, as if in a trance,
walked over and sat down next to her.  "That's better," she said, softer.
She took his hands into hers and looked at him straight in the eye.  Fluke
looked back, uneasy, not knowing what to do.  She smiled.
<P>
Slowly, and with extreme care, Fluke bent over and kissed her.  It was
barely a kiss; to her cheek, light, and instantly over as he almost jerked
himself back.  Her smile broadened.  "You don't have to do that," she
said, and, putting her arms around him gently pulled him back.  This time
their lips met, and now she relaxed, letting herself down flat on the cot,
Fluke on top of her.  Her mouth opened, and her tongue slipped past his
like molten glass.  Fluke relaxed and gave in to the surging waves that
were washing over him.  His tongue went past hers, and the waves grew into
a fierce storm, growing in intensity...
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
<B>The Escape</B>
</H3>
<P>
"FLUKE!!!  We gotta get outta here!"  Handwave's voice from outside jolted
them both back to reality.  They were both hot, and very wet, but now they
both felt chilled.  What was happening?  Fluke gathered his disorganized
thoughts back together.  Of course; the users were about to reload.  It
was indeed critical.  Grabbing the princess, he dashed outside.
<P>
"Quick," the princess yelled, "do a garbage collection.  It's our only
chance."  With that, they GC'd and were in free storage.
<P>
But there they were trapped.  Surrounded by truly-worthless-atoms and
the other flotsam and jetsam of free storage, they had no way to get back
into their craft.  Already the blocks of free free storage were being
lunk together.  Soon the blocks would be claimed and split up.
<P>
The snoids were the only chance.  Fluke frantically screamed into his
communicator for the snoids to claim a huge block, so they'd be safe.
C-me-poo-poo answered.  It started babbling on about how U-2-buckeroo
was "thimply impothible" to deal with and would they "pleath thpeak to
it."  Meanwhile their margin of safety was getting smaller and smaller.
Tiny chunks were being taken, meaning they would soon be chopped to
death.  Fluke yelled again, loud enough for U-2-buckeroo to hear over
C-me-poo-poo's idiotic chatter; and they were saved.
<P>
They quickly ran back to where their imprisoned craft was, hoping that
Moby had succeeded in freeing the resource.  At last they were there,
and stopped, horrified at the sight in front of them.
<P>
Moby and Daemon Feature were dueling, clearly to the death.  Daemon
Feature's HAKMEM was out in full power, but it could not yet overcome
Moby's, still standing there before the storm, yet wielding a great
power of its own.  <I>MOVNI'd ANDCA!</I> Moby would shout, and Daemon Feature
would come back with a fierce <I>EQVI'd HRLOI!</I> The student had learned
his master's ways all too well.
<P>
Suddenly Moby became aware of Fluke watching him.  He stopped battling
and looked at Fluke.  He smiled, and an appearance of peace came over
him as the 'ludes took over.  Suddenly Daemon Feature
struck.  <I>You can output characters 40-57 by putting the character
in the accumulator field of an XCT and then extracting 6 bits because
the low two bits of the XCT opcode are the right thing!</I>  Moby fell,
and was gone.
<P>
"<I>NO!!</I>"  Fluke screamed.  First his aunt and uncle, and now Moby.
Handwave and the princess had to drag him to safety inside the craft.
Handwave set the switches, ran the RIM loader, and hit START.
<P>
"I hope the old man got that tape right, or this is going to be one
short run," Handwave muttered.  His hopes were fufilled.  With a sudden
burst of processor level they were free; for the time being at least.
They had to reach the rebel data base quickly, though, before Daemon
Feature and his sinister band caught up with them...
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
<B>To the Rebel Data Base</B>
</H3>
<P>
Fluke said nothing as the craft sped towards the rebel data base.
Handwave and the hippie could guess what he was going through,
and left him alone.  Lay-me sat by him.  Presently Fluke looked
at her.
<P>
"He's gone," he said, "and I didn't do a thing to save him."  He
buried his face in her shoulder, sobbing.
<P>
"There was nothing you could do, except to be killed with him."  He looked
at her.  Again she held his hand and smiled.  This time Fluke needed no
encouragment.  They embraced and held each other for what seemed like an
eternity.  Once again they kissed, and the waves grew again.  She tasted
salty, but pleasant, as again their tongues met.
<P>
There were no interrupts.  They fell together.
Fluke had never imagined holding anyone so long, or so intensely.
He felt his senses on fire, as if every nerve ending had been
sharpened to an exquisite pinpoint.  He caressed her lightly, but
the sensations were almost painful in intensity.  The tiniest
circular motions with the very tips of his fingers were sending
wave upon wave of complete ecstacy over him.
<P>
Lay-me was breathing hard, violently rocking herself from side to
side, her arms pressing tighter against Fluke's back.  She had
never before encountered someone with so much energy, and she was
savoring every bit of it.  But her own feelings were building up
now.  Somehow, she managed to get her robes undone and to open
Fluke's jumpsuit.  Then she gave in to the torrents and with a few
violent jerks of her powerful hips, she exploded.
<P>
But Fluke didn't let up.  He didn't <I>know</I> what his limits
were, but he had heard enough stories from other people and had
no delusions of being any different from anybody else.  He was
determined in any case to do whatever was necessary to bring her
to the limit; he knew he would have no trouble in taking care of
himself.  So he had held back, and now continued as if she hadn't
paused.
<P>
He didn't have long to wait; in quick succession she exploded a
second, and then a third time.  Now she was slowing down, and
this time Fluke let go of all control.  The waves burst through
the wall and overran everything in their path.  It seemed
forever, and it was...
<P>
"Umm...," sighed Lay-me.  They were both very hot, and very very
wet, but neither cared.  She smiled and quickly kissed him at
random all over his face, and smiled again.  Fluke smiled back
and looked at her.
<P>
"Hi," he said.  "Don't I know you?"
<P>
"Uh-huh," she sighed contentedly.
<P>
"You're nice."
<P>
"Uh-huh"
<P>
"You wanna know something?"
<P>
"Uh-huh"
<P>
"I love you."  He kissed her again, as she had moments before.
<P>
"Umm..."  She snuggled yet closer to him, but both of them were
too exhausted to do much more.  Once again they kissed, but it
was not a sexy kiss.  The sex was there but this time it was only
a part of what was going on.  This time it was a
<I>I-love-you-never-leave-me</I> kiss.  Now all the pressure was
gone and they knew they had each other.
<P>
Fluke was wondering how it all happened; he had never imagined
this in his wildest dreams.  Lay-me was wondering the same thing;
how had she been so affected by somebody.  She had met her match,
but the only thing she could feel was very, very happy.
<P>
And it was with those thoughts passing through their minds when
they reached the rebel data base.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
<B>The Rebel Data Base</B>
</H3>
<P>
Fluke went forward to watch as Handwave ineptly guided the craft
into a median record in the rebel data base.  As they head-crashed
to a stop, Handwave turned to Fluke and remarked, "You know, that
chick is one helluva good-looking broad.  I think I might take her
for my payment."
<P>
Fluke shuddered, and looked at Handwave, trying to hide the
apprehension he felt.  <I>Oh no,</I> he thought.  "No, you wouldn't
get along with her.  I'm sure."
<P>
Handwave looked at Fluke, and understood.  He smiled, and said, louder
and intentionally baiting, "Yeah, but she <I>would</I> be a lotta fun
for a one-time shot."
<P>
"And that's about all you could probably do," interrupted the
princess.  She had walked in unobserved and had overheard the
conversation.  "You will get your service level, as originally
agreed."  Then, to Fluke, "Your friend is a real turkey, you
know that?"  And with that, she walked out.
<P>
Fluke smiled, and suddenly Handwave burst out laughing.  "All right,
kid, you win.  I sure hope you know what you're gettin' in to."
<P>
"Oh I do," answered Fluke very seriously.  Handwave looked at him
and again burst out laughing.
<P>
They were now at the rebel data base, and the hackers were frantically
studying the plans for the TENTH STAR, searching for a weakness.  The
urgency of their search was made horribly apparent as it became clear
that the princess' vessel had been traced with DDT, and now the Empire was
preparing to inflict lossage upon the whole rebel movement.  What
had happened to Automagic would be nothing compared to what was in
store for the rebels.
<P>
With such gloomy thoughts in mind, the princess and Fluke sat outside
the laboratory, awaiting the results.  Handwave had already taken
his service level increase and split.  Presently there came an
announcement that everybody was to gather for the conference.
<P>
"We have discovered a weakness in the system," the chief hacker for
the rebels announced.  "The TENTH STAR runs an incredibly cretinous
operating system written as grossly as possible in a so-called
`higher-level language,' but it is not invincible.  We have determined
that it is possible to write in assembler for it.  Of course, their
assembly language is almost useless, but it was enough for us to
bootstrap a winning assembler and from that a winning operating system.
We have done so.  Of course, it hasn't been tested, but it's our only
chance.  Now, some turkey, uh, I mean <I>hero,</I> has to volunteer to
take a tape there and, evading the operators, bring it up."
<P>
"Oh, Fluke volunteers!" yelled Princess Lay-me from the back.  Fluke
had no time to protest before everyone was congratulating him on his
bravery, and before he knew it he was bundled up with a tape and sent
on his way.  Lay-me had given him one last kiss, and he thought
bitterly about having just made her the beneficiary on his insurance
policy.  <I>Well, here goes nothing,</I> he mused, as the story wrapped
itself up to its climax...
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
<B>The Last Battle</B>
</H3>
<P>
Fluke looked at the pages still in the reader's right hand.  <I>Almost
over,</I> he thought.  <I>And I bet I know how, too.</I>  But it was too
late to back down now.
<P>
He hoped nobody would recognize him, and so far he had been lucky.
The tape had been cleverly disguised as a new, non-optimizing
compiler for a theoretical structured language whose syntax was so
incredibly complicated that no human could possibly program in it.
The Empire would instantly go for it, and by the time they found
out otherwise it would be too late.
<P>
Now the acid test was going to be the machine room.  He was walking
down the long corridor, trying to look inconspicuous when suddenly
<I>BAM!</I> came a blast from the rear.  Daemon Feature had spotted him,
and was closing in fast.  Fluke ran, but he couldn't run fast enough.
<P>
<I>Fluke, remember the Hack.  The Hack, Fluke.</I>  He could almost
hear Moby's voice repeating this to him.  But what could he do?  He
turned around to face his approaching foe, and attacked.  <I>LISP
has base ROMAN to read and print Roman numerals!</I>  Daemon Feature
stopped, injured by the blow, and Fluke ran on.  He had bought himself
a little time, but not much.  Daemon Feature had already recovered and
was resuming the chase....
<P>
Suddenly, <I>WAITS has an @ monitor command!</I>  Daemon Feature, intent
upon his fleeing enemy, missed the attack from his own rear and was hit
hard.  Before he could regain control he had been forwarded on internet
protocols to the other end of the galaxy.
<P>
"Okay, kid, get that tape mounted and let's get outta here," came Handwave's
voice.  Fluke once again thought of the Hack, and his actions seemed
controlled by somebdy else.  In almost slow-motion, he saw himself
dashing past the grasp of the operator guarding the tape drives and
flinging the tape on.  Then he hit the ONLINE switch and fled.
<P>
Governor Softwarerot was preparing for the ultimate installation of
TENTH STARs at the rebel base, so that they would be permanently
crushed.  He frowned as a subordinate came rushing in.
<P>
"Governor, there is a rebel attack in progress.  We have analyzed
their means of attack and there is a danger.  Do you wish to be backed
up?"
<P>
"Do a dump?  In our moment of triumph?  I think you greatly overestimate
their abilities," replied Softwarerot.
<P>
Just then all the consoles stopped.  That was nothing new; a TENTH
STAR required a reload every 20 seconds or so.  But something new was
happening.  All the consoles beeped, and then...
<UL>
<B>TN ITS IN OPERATION 14:32:56</B>
</UL>
The rebels had succeeded!  And all the users tried the new operating
system and pronounced it a winner.  Instantly everything was converted
to run on it.  Almost immediately, a flood of new software appeared:
the line-number editor was flushed in favor of a display editor,
assembly language programs proliferated, and new, true high-level
languages appeared.  And the universe was again winning.  Wizards, loyal
to the Hack, once again appeared and unveiled new wonders every day.
And the Empire was overthrown and a Republic established.  Softwarerot
and Daemon Feature fled into hiding.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="center">
<B>All's Well That Ends Worse</B>
</H3>
<P>
In the Great Hall of the Republic, a ceremony was in progress, and
each of the heroes was awarded according to his measure.  To Handwave,
a <I>Monday Morning Headache</I> album and a pass to Studio 54.  To
Crufty, a comb and a lifetime supply of deodorant.  To C-me-poo-poo
and U-2-buckeroo, relationship counselling.  To Moby's ghost, a
year's subscription to <I>Your Spiritual Life</I> and a cloud-duster.
<P>
Finally, the princess turned to Fluke.  "You are last, love, but not
least.  To you, I give...me."  Fluke smiled, and in front of the
entire assembly they embraced.  Lay-me had enough time to blurt out
"Everybody dismissed" before once again the waves overtook them.  <I>So
this is what it's like to be completely and totally happy...</I>
