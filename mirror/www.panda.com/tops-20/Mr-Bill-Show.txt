Mr. Hands: Hi kids!  It's time for the Mr. Bill Show!

Mr. Bill: Yay!

H: Say Mr. Bill, I see you've bought a DECSYSTEM-20.

B: Yes, I'm gonna run a service bureau and make a lot of money!

H: Hey Mr. Bill, your DEC Software Specialist Sluggo is here to
	install some patches.

B: Ohh, he's gonna be mean to me!

H: Come now, Mr. Bill.  Your SWS Sluggo is your FRIEND.  First,
	he's going to map your directory.

B: Ohhhhhh!

H: Say Mr. Bill, your SWS Sluggo says your directory has some
	errors in an FDB.  He's going to fix it for you.

B: Ohhhhhhh!

H: Your SWS says your hardware's bad, since it happened just
	while he was writing out your directory.  Fortunately,
	your DEC Field Service Representative Sluggo just came in
	to do PM.

B: I don't think you're a friend Mr. Hands all you do is let
	Sluggo be mean to me.

H: Your FE says for you to take a CLOSE look at this power supply
	fan.

B: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

H: Your FE says your problem is dog hairs.

B: Oh Spot's my friend don't throw him out the window we're on
	the ninth floor...ohhhhhh!  Poor Spot!

H: Now your FE is going to clean your disks.

B: Ohhhhhhhh!

H: He says that your disks had a lot of oxide on them and he had
	to clean it ALL off.  It looks like your system hasn't
	been properly maintained, Mr. Bill.  Your FE Sluggo has
	no choice but to cancel your service contract and junk
	your machine.

B: Ohhhhh!  Let me have my machine back you are all being mean to
	me.

H: Come now, Mr. Bill.  Your DEC salesman Sluggo just came in to
	sell you a VAX to replace your -20.

B: OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

H: Well kids, that's all for now.  See ya next week, when Mr.
	Bill goes to DECUS!
